You can't compare this to Michelin star experience. They are not suppose to compete. It is not fine dining. There are many great Indian/Nepalese restaurants in Madrid. I'm a huge fan of many. This goes high in the list. Ugly duckling with superb food. First look of the restaurant from outside doesn't look ""that promising"". Not the prettiest neighborhood either. If you go early, since they open 19:30, you are probably the only customer, but around 9pm people start coming and coming. I think the food and nice owner attracts the people. Menu has wider selection of things from all around India than any other Indian restaurant I have visited in Madrid. Prices are good average, but that makes the value for money very good. Location is good for people who live in Canillas and Hortaleza and can walk there. For people coming from further it's not the best location. Doesn't seem easiest place to park a car. Kind of nearby to Pinar del Rey metro though. Sodexo restaurant tickets are not accepted.

Right from moment we entered the place, (we were made very welcome by Krishna, probably the spirit behind the place) till the time we sampled the food it was a great experience. We ordered some vegetable pakoras as starters and then moved to Malai tikka and seekh kebabs plus chicken biryani and Chana masala. Everything has a distinct taste and was freshly prepared. Naans were soft and went perfectly with the mains. We finished off by ordering Mango Kulfi and Gulab Jaman and between them mango kulfi was a clear winner.

That being said, the food is quite good (I had the duck). We had a brief mix-up because my boyfriend, who is allergic to nuts, found that his salad came with walnuts on top—walnuts were listed on the Spanish menu, but we were given the English menu, which did not list them. At first we were blamed for not reading the menu thoroughly, but when the staff realized their mistake they graciously brought out a new salad.

From the minute we arrived we knew this would be a great evening. The venue has a perfect mexican atmosphere. This family driven restaurant is perfectly located close to the palace. They opened this restaurant 3 years ago, after running a simular place in Mexico for 23 years. We ordered a couple of margarites, a bit sweet after my taste, but good. I prefered the mexican beer. So - the food; we had nachos to share as starter. The guacamole and pico de gallo was perfectly done, and gave this easy dish a fantastic taste. The sauces were great. If you like it hot you should ask for the habanero sauce as well.  For main course we ordered tacos. We had one order with beef and one with lamb. The lamb was served with a very delicious mint jelly. The tacos were so great and gave the exact taste of Mexico. The family that runs this restaurant were so friendly, it felt like you had kown them for a long time when the dinner was over.

We arrived at approximately 10pm and hadn’t booked, but we’re quickly taken to a table near the bar by a very friendly waiter. A quick glance at the drinks menu had a plethora of Mexican cocktails and being a fan of spice, I opted for a cocktail that contained a dark Modelo with Tabasco and some other spices (photos of ingredients to recreate this at home were taken at end of night - a must for any fan of spice!) We both chose the chicken fajitas and they arrived within 10 minutes to our table. They tasted fantastic and the homemade tacos really set the meal off.

Quality/Quantity/Price of food is great. Waiters spot on all the time. We ordered everest steam momo, butter chicken, pilau rice and garlic naan. Krishna suggested he would serve us a ""surprise"" lamb curry and we accepted....great choice! Few comments about some bad reviews we see here: Don't think there are fake reviews because it's really good. The location and neighbourhood is a bit strange and far from city centre, but who cares when food and service is great. Not for tourists that want to have a view on skyline of Madrid, but for people who love Indian food. It's a simple and not a posh restaurant. You can have food here for 45 € / couple or at Diverxo for 360 € / couple and be equally happy. Sure, it's a different experience.  It is not exactly like in UK, but it's the closest it gets in Madrid. A bit less spices, which makes sense because Spanish people don't like too spicy food. Tried more than 10 Indian restaurants in Madrid and every time we were disappointed. Forget restaurants in Lavapies unless you are only capable of ordering food based on pictures in the menu. This is now our favourite local restaurant- see you there ;-) Alex & Cristina",2016-09-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d9832154-Reviews-or100-Everest_Tandoori_Nepali_Indian_Restaurant-Madrid.html,UID_22248,0.064,0.794,0.143,0.9747,0.1242504409171075,0.6000293944738389,0.4423866666666667,1325,105,0.0792452830188679,2,45,False,60,0.0704225352112676,0.2253521126760563,0.2676056338028169,0.0422535211267605,0.1971830985915492,0.028169014084507,0.0422535211267605,0.0422535211267605,0.056338028169014,0.028169014084507,238,168,4.567226890756302,0,0,move london madrid year ago final found authent indian food special touch nepales ingredi madrid qualiti quantiti price food great waiter spot time order everest steam momo butter chicken pilau rice garlic naan krishna suggest would serv us surpris lamb curri accept great choic comment bad review see think fake review realli good locat neighbourhood bit strang far citi centr care food servic great tourist want view skylin madrid peopl love indian food simpl posh restaur food coupl diverxo coupl equal happi sure differ experi exactli like uk closest get madrid bit less spice make sens spanish peopl like spici food tri indian restaur madrid everi time disappoint forget restaur lavapi unless capabl order food base pictur menu favourit local restaur see alex cristina,bad review,2,Indian

All the food that everyone else ordered looked really good too so the following day we decided to go back that evening and wasn't disappointed we did. We had a chicken curry, tandoori mixed grill, onion bhaji, two nann breads and a madras side sauce, we also had a large lager, large absolute vodka and two extra large Bailey's on ice after our meal and we were shocked when they bought the bill over at the end of our meal as it was only €56.35 and that even included popadoms and dips. I am honestly looking forward to going back to Madrid to use this restaurant again not just for the beautiful food but the staff were very friendly without being to over attentive.

This time we made sure to make a reservation, especially since it was Easter! The restaurant/bistro is small with a very limited menu. But the farm to table freshness of the ingredients, the culinary skills of the kitchen, the great service, the genuine warmth of its owner Pedro, the elegant presentations, the funky modern ambiance, and the amble servings guarantee you a most enjoyable experience!!! CC and I decided to split the Goat Cheese Salad. I am not a big salad person but this was excellent and could easily be an entree for a light eater. CC selected the Vegan Paella for her entree and I opted for the Almond and Parsley Crusted Cod Loin. The cod was absolutely delicious and presented as nicely as any I have ever eaten. CC could not finish her Paella. She said it was SUPERB but there was just too much to eat. Pedro mistook this for dissatisfaction and immediately offered to make CC something else. You do not see that pride much any more! Obviously, there was not room for dessert. That will have to wait for our next visit! So if you are near the Prado be sure to have a meal here.

Nothing could be further from the truth: 1. They have over 30 dishes, but when asked whats the special or recommended, no answer, ""everything is good"" 2. I have had indian food all over the world and this would be the most watered down food I have ever tasted. Not a hint of spices, just a tons of creamy sauce with no flavour.  3. Seating outside is next to parked cars and dumpsters, not the most pleasant views out there 4. Ordered Lassi, turns out they make it out of milk instead of yogurt, was not expecting that! Did not sit well at all! 5. Naan was great, so that was good 6. Waiters did not know a word of English, granted its Spain but come on, you don't understand basic English? 7. Waiters did not seem professional, joking around in front of customers, making snide remarks Overall not a good expreience, if the food was good might have recommended it but the food was equally not good.

It was very easy to arrive at the Anton Martin Metro station, walk a very short distance on Calle Santa Isabel and find El Sur on a corner just a few blocks away. Once inside, all of the staff immediately gave us a warm greeting. We arrived early enough (8:45 pm) to be seated right away. By the time we left, it was packed with people waiting. Hint: lots of people means it is a place for you to visit. There are English menus and the staff speaks English as well. We started out with a caprese salad and the musaka. Both were well prepared and tasty. For entrees, we had the chicken curry, salmon skewers, and a special garlic shrimp dish. Even though we shared everything, I can not pick one entre over another. They were all ""the best"". Alex suggested that we finish with a special dessert, but he wouldn't tell us what it was, but he promised we would like it. He was so right. We definitely liked it but could not really ID what it was. Not to spoil it for you, just tell him that you want the dessert that is creamy in texture and you already have a ""passion"" about it. Thank you Alex and the rest of the staff for a great meal.

I ordered three al pastor tacos and my friend has the carne enchiladas. They both were good with decent sized portions. The bill was 30 euro for two drinks and two entires, which is very expensive in a city like Madrid and for this restaurant. Overall, my friend and I left hungry and knowing that we would not be going back to this place.

They make their own baguette and give you a basket freshly sliced. You can order half portions of their main dishes so you can try many different dishes without getting too full. Prices are very reasonable! We came here the first night in Spain, in Madrid and felt like we got a good intro into Spanish cuisine. It's a tiny place so keep your eyes peeled for the sign! Came at 7:30 pm on a Monday and it wasn't crowded yet. The staff was super friendly and attentive-- I told our server I was pregnant and sadly couldn't drink alcohol and at the end he surprised us and brought me a complimentary virgin apple liquer they make in house and my husband a fresh watermelon mojito shot that he shook up right at our table and congratulated us! The owner also made sure to check on us and see us on our way out to make sure we enjoyed our meal. So glad we read the reviews and decided to stop by for our first meal! Here is what we got and what we definitely recommend! -Grilled calamari (chipitones plancha)--huge juicy pieces prepped and cooked to perfectly so it wasn't rubbery but super tender.  - Prawns in garlicky butter sauce (gambon)- whole pieces of fried garlic with flavorful peeled prawns -musaka- looked like an eggplant lasagna when it first came out. But instead of pasta it has thin slices of potatoes like you find in gratin with thin slices of eggplant and spiced minced meat. Delicious!  - Cuban inspired shredded braised beef (ropa vieja)- it comes with either rice or homemade potato chips. we had it with both!

Very yummy food and quite accommodating service. Aside from being attentive at the table, my younger sister was a bit dehydrated from sightseeing in Madrid's summer heat earlier in the day and had to step outside as we were ordering. The servers were attentive to her--actually unlike anything I've ever seen! They went outside to check on her, and brought her a restaurant chair, water and bread to help her recover as she got some fresh air, and then insisted we rearrange so she was sitting by the air conditioning. They actually even brought my dad a beer outside as he was waiting outside with her! Then they both returned inside for a wonderful, delicious meal! All of the ingredients were very fresh and preparations were incredible. La Tragantúa is a very quaint/hole-in-the-wall type restaurant and is one of the most charming I've eaten in after a year living in Madrid. We loved our whole experience and were pleasantly surprised by the servers' clear passion for both their restaurant and for the dining experiences of their customers.  Definitely make a reservation!

The owner and the rest of the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, and the service overall was excellent. The food was good but nothing special - as others have noted the French Burger is not to be missed and the definite highlight of the meal with its caramelized onions and giant wedge of brie.

Maybe 1 or 2€ more expensive than average prices for ""menu del dia"", but definitely it is worth: not only for the quality but also for the great variety they offer, with fusion dishes (they go beyond the typical first course ""gazpacho"" and second course ""chicken with fries"").  I enjoyed particularly the Salmorejo, a traditional dish of my hometown (Córdoba): it tasted like the one my mom prepares! OUTSTANDING! I also tried the small burger and the thai chicken, both excellent choices.  The main problem of the restaurant is that is too small. Therefore, not only is complicated to get a spot, but also is a little bit unpleasant given how narrow are the tables. The service was excellent: nice and friendly waiters served our food very fast.

Ordered from the daily menu (written on the front window) and everyone asked for a different combination of 3 courses included in the lunch. Each item was excellent. The fresh tomato taste in my cold tomato soup jumped from the bowl. The included glass of wine (red, white or rose) all were good.

I e mailed Eduardo to make certain our table would be ready. He greeted us on arrival like we were old friends though my wife and I had never met him before. OK so here are the ratings...... Drinks: Modelo Beer, Margarita 5/5 all wonderful. Nachos: 5/5 what was great is the chips are made with Olive Oil not greasy and very crisp! These were the best chips we ever had in any restaurant. The Guacamole was good as well. Enchilada: Beef and Cheese was scrumptious as well as steaming hot the way food should be served. FAJITAS: Chicken, all white meat simply incredible, served with peppers. All vegetables and corn tortillas were very fresh. Waiter: he was excellent 5/5 Overall: in my best Spanish: ""Mui Bueno"" or  in English ""Very Very Good""  At the end of the meal we had a Tequila and a Chocolate Tequila which was something different brought to us by Eduardo and our friendly waiter. What strikes us both is Eduardo LOVES what he is doing here making great tasting food. This is what makes even a small restaurant a Great Restaurant it is called ""Intense Passion."" Thank you Eduardo for a great experience and fun afternoon. Every reader going here for certain will literally impress your taste buds as T&T is a  THUMBS UP WINNER!

The restaurant itself is quite small which is perfect for a romantic meal for couples. It holds around 6 tables which is small but the food was amazing and makes up for the size of the place. I would recommend calling to reserve a table before going though due to the size. My partner and I shared the nachos to start, they were top notch. The spicy salsa dip which came with them was to die for. We then ordered chicken fajitas and steak tacos to share. We both loved everything about our food. Upon getting our bill we were offered two shots of tequila on the house. I thought this was a wonderful gesture from the staff at this restaurant and it certainly was the perfect ending to a perfect night. All staff in the restaurant were also really lovely.

And we experienced one of the best meals of our entire Spain visit. Unfortunately, we didn't have reservations - but the staff was very, very friendly and was able to accommodate four adults for a late afternoon service. We agreed to come back and did. When we were seated, we realized why reservations are so necessary - we only counted 8 tables in this tiny establishment. The head waiter did a great job of trying to communicate with us in English as we tried to do the same with our high school Spanish. So if some of what I write isn't 100% accurate, it's because it got lost in translation. We ordered the brie cheese appetizer with jalapenos and sweet chili preserve (very good!) along with the daily special. Each one of us tried something different to get the full flavor of the place - and my only regret is that we just didn't have enough room in our stomachs to try more! With the daily special, we tried the cold tomato bisque (with hard-boiled egg slices & cured iberico ham chunks), melted cheese with roasted patron peppers (not spicy), salad with shrimp & calamari, and fried dumplings. The next course consisted of risotto, fried Hake fish, pork medallions and Thai chicken. It was all delicious - but we agreed the Thai chicken with rice was the tastiest. (BTW -- having never had Hake before - it was an interesting experience. Although it's a member of the Cod family, it has more of a crab-meat flakiness, than the cod you typically find in fish & chips.) For dessert, we tried this amazing pastry that was like the combination of a moist, mini-rum cupcake with a flan-like, custard topping that was something I had never tasted before! (What was that?) But it was awesome! All this with a bottle of wine, a beer, several other glasses of wine, an espresso... and our bill was only around $85! Since we were one of the last to be seated and the last to remain - we chatted with the owner and head waiter (who are brothers) and learned that ""tragantua"" means someone who overeats in Basque! Never once did we feel like we were imposing on their time - although it was way past closing time. We never got to thank the chef for the amazing meal - but we did tell the owner and brother that we loved their place. As I mentioned before - our only regret was that we couldn't order/try more of the delicious-sounding items on the menu. (Although we tried - and the waiter insisted that we would never be able to finish everything... he was right!) Another bonus to this restaurant is that's it's only a walk away from the famed Madrid Atocha railway station (Gare de Madrid).

The owner who was a fantastic host made the night the most enjoyable we have had as friends EVER (in the whole world). He clearly loved what he was doing. We will definitely be back if we are in the area in future. The bill at the end was exceptional too, for four people with starters and mains, 2 bottles of wine, 6 beers was just 160 euro, but it does depend on what you order.

I felt myself and my husband were not received very well and we saw none of the friendliness that other reviewers had commented on. Restaurant had just opened when we got there so there were only 2 other tables, it lacked a little atmosphere it got better when the other few tables filled up, I would suggest music in the background at the beginning of opening time to help this along. Food was very nice, I had fried green tomatoes with goats cheese to start whilst husband had skewered prawns and squid. For the main my husband had the Turkish style burger whilst I had the cod with black pudding - both delicious. We were too full for dessert. The main course came quite quickly after the starter and I did feel we were being rushed a bit.

Alex the waiter (and the owner and all the staff) are all very very nice and make you very welcome. The menu is short and but we came two nights and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Alex told us all the raciones could be served in half portions which was great. Advised us to have four halves which we did. I was doubtful that this would be enough but he insisted that we would not want any more and he was right. All delicious. With good bread, a bottle of navarra red wine, one pudding and one coffee it cost 43 euro - great value. Came back next night but because we had a big lunch ate a lot less but still had a great time.

They were still using their Christmas Menu which had many interesting items on it. We did get the bread with the meal (it was excellent). The Artichoke cream soup as the starter was savory and warm (excellent). The Iberian Pork shoulder was tender and paired well with the potatoes and plum sauce that came with it (excellent). The Veal filet steak in the Madeira sauce was very good (to reach excellent it would have to have been plated with something else for contrast). The wine selection was excellent (lots of really good reds to choose from).

My choice was a glass from Rias Baixas, very close to Portugal. It went really well with the cod filet. We also discussed about my desert choice, passion fruit tart. It has been improved over time and my suggestion of a less sugary version was well taken. This is the right way of running a decent restaurant and doing business.

I reserved a spot at the last moment on the fork for 9pm just incase but it was mostly empty at that time. I ordered a steak because it was my last meal there and the server recommended it... but should have known never order steak from a place that doesn't specialize in steak... they actually didn't ask me how i would like it cooked... i think the quality of the meat was good but it was wayy too rare for me (I usually like it medium rare or medium) - i kept on chewing and chewing and it was hard to eat because it was too rare for my taste (plus no steak knife). I think they cook it slowly over time but it just wasn't the doneness i preferred :( I asked it to be cooked to medium and they said it was medium already. They ended up cooking it more for me but then it ended up just being well-done which isn't my preference either... it was better than rare though so I didn't complain - i was too tired to go somewhere else and still not completely full so I ordered 1/2 order of a cod dish after the steak which was a lot better (cooked really well) but it wasn't mind blowing either. The portion for that was pretty good for 1/2 though. Steak full portion is 250g. I did like the interior a lot (super cute!) and the server was nice and attentive and let me try the wines before committing. It was nice and quiet so that was also a plus. This was my most expensive meal in Spain (38 euros with drinks so its not like super expensive but still :(((( ) i should have ordered the dishes people talked about on here instead. ,2017-05-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10077266-Reviews-or150-The_Spanish_Farm-Madrid.html,UID_22465,0.058,0.787,0.156,0.9895,0.1323469387755101,0.6094217687074829,0.7694000000000001,1595,173,0.1084639498432601,1,51,False,75,0.125,0.1,0.3,0.05,0.15,0.05,0.05,0.025,0.075,0.075,318,167,4.015723270440252,0,0,last meal spain want bit special reserv spot last moment fork pm incas mostli empti time order steak last meal server recommend known never order steak place special steak actual ask would like cook think qualiti meat good wayi rare usual like medium rare medium kept chew chew hard eat rare tast plu steak knife think cook slowli time done prefer ask cook medium said medium alreadi end cook end well done prefer either better rare though complain tire go somewher els still complet full order order cod dish steak lot better cook realli well mind blow either portion pretti good though steak full portion g like interior lot super cute server nice attent let tri wine commit nice quiet also plu expens meal spain euro drink like super expens still order dish peopl talk instead,average review,3,Spanish

We found it while visiting the botanic gardens opposite and were looking for a place we could meet our vegan daughter - the vegan paella stood out so we booked a table for lunch. It's beautifully decorated - quite arty with lots of wood and artefacts and interesting lighting. There are nice tables with proper linen and rush baskets with oil, vinegar and a proper pepper mill. It's quite small so I recommend booking to be sure of a table. We had lunch twice here and would have returned for dinner had we had time. The menu isn't enormous but what is there is varied and gives choice of fish, meat and veggie/vegan. The vermouth is lovely too. Olives with smoked salmon and cream cheese came gratis when we ordered - delicious and as my husband doesn't eat salmon, they brought some chorizo and breadsticks for him. We shared the goats' cheese salad which came with a wonderful sherry vinegar dressing, then ordered the vegan paella and mackerel with anchovies and green herb sauce with some gorgeous sourdough bread (extra). We had some beers and a vermouth with a twist of orange. Everything was beautifully presented, was fresh and delicious. Service was friendly, helpful and patient.

It met our needs: it offered authentic Spanish cuisine and was near the Prado museum. We reserved dinner for two at 8pm; not quite authentic Spanish (meaning 9pm or after, later than the usual time most Americans eat), but close enough. The restaurant is located between the Prado and the Royal Botanical Gardens...a perfect location. We were welcomed cordially, and seated immediately. The restaurant is deliberately not ornate; it seats about 14 people at tables, and maybe another six at the bar. Menus are available in English; the staff speaks English as well, some better than others...but far better than my Spanish. We started off by splitting a salad with goat cheese and walnuts, after first ordering drinks. My wife ordered the sangria of the day, which was delivered with more cinnamon than she's used to. It was quite good, nonetheless. I got a glass of wine...and we split a bottle of carbonated water. Bread also was delivered to the table; it costs 1.5 euros per person...we didn't order it, but weren't going to raise a stink about it. The bread was quite good as well, and added to our overall enjoyment of the meal. From there, dinner was delivered. My wife had cod with a saffron sauce that she truly enjoyed. I had the Iberian chopped pork filet served over couscous with a plum sauce. I chose incredibly well. Both meals can easily be recommended. I finished with an espresso; the Spanish Farm, like many places throughout Madrid, serves Nespresso....it delivers a consistent quality of coffee. We didn't have dessert, because we'd gone to a chocolateria prior to dinner for a snack of hot chocolate and churros. Dinner was extraordinarily well priced, at less than 60 euros. My wife said that if we lived in Madrid, we'd be back again. I agree. My only suggestion to the owner is that the pacing on dinner might be spaced out a bit. We were out the door in little more than an hour; I didn't feel rushed at all, but a more leisurely pace might have worked even better.",2017-09-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10077266-Reviews-or130-The_Spanish_Farm-Madrid.html,UID_22526,0.009,0.832,0.159,0.9962,0.264423076923077,0.4277777777777777,0.4504291666666667,2050,159,0.0775609756097561,0,75,False,82,0.12,0.16,0.38,0.04,0.16,0.02,0.02,0.0,0.08,0.02,358,234,4.729050279329609,0,0,found spanish farm review written met need offer authent spanish cuisin near prado museum reserv dinner two pm quit authent spanish mean pm later usual time american eat close enough restaur locat prado royal botan garden perfect locat welcom cordial seat immedi restaur deliber ornat seat peopl tabl mayb anoth six bar menu avail english staff speak english well better other far better spanish start split salad goat chees walnut first order drink wife order sangria day deliv cinnamon use quit good nonetheless got glass wine split bottl carbon water bread also deliv tabl cost euro per person order go rais stink bread quit good well ad overal enjoy meal dinner deliv wife cod saffron sauc truli enjoy iberian chop pork filet serv couscou plum sauc chose incred well meal easili recommend finish espresso spanish farm like mani place throughout madrid serv nespresso deliv consist qualiti coffe dessert gone chocolateria prior dinner snack hot chocol churro dinner extraordinarili well price less euro wife said live madrid back agre suggest owner pace dinner might space bit door littl hour feel rush leisur pace might work even better,good review,4,Spanish

My wife and I live near the Mexican border, go to Mexico over 10 times a year, and have both lived in Mexico a year each. This place rivals the best Mexican food from Mexico, Texas, SoCal and other border states. Why is that? Well, the chef is from Veracruz which is in Mexico. We've tried Mexican food in over 10 countries and while some taste delicious, they are not authentic Mexican. These places tend to make many Europeans think they're having authentic Mexican, when they're not.  Not only is the food delicious but the service is also amazing. I wish they ran their restaurant right next to my house because I'd go there all the time.

We shared several tapas (plate of jamon, shredded cuban steak; grilled calamari; shrimp in garlic butter; curry chicken). Finished it off with dessert (chocolate mousse cake and cheesecake).

Gazpacho was ok, but nothing fancy, cheese variations also ok, home made bread was tasty, but not spectacular. Codfish was fresh, well prepared, few bones were left in the fillet. Real highlight was the beef fillet steak, nicely aged, very soft, medium-rare done, it was literaly melting on the tounge. Demiglace well balanced, strong but not to salty, truffle on the top was little overkill. Definetly one of the best steaks of my live. Desert was tartelet with passionfruit filling as a recomandation from a waiter, it was nice but little too sweet. Coffe was a little disapointment with no foam and to much sourness to my liking.

And taberna el Sur was a great discovery for us with its close location to our hotel on Atocha, over 1200 mainly positive reviews and reasonable prices.  Indeed the dinner was beyond our expectations!!! We came later then we booked for, but the manager of the place was really nice to rearrange the tables for us.  While we were waiting for our dishes they brought their homemade bread! Gosh! It's dangerous! We ordered two portions of it!  Both of my friends took salmon skewers and I went for our waiter's suggestion ""Solomila Sur"" which was a gastronomic perfection! Pork meat in a red wine sauce with baked potatoes! Completely new sweet-n-salty taste! And of course we got sangria which was another highlight of the place. And now come the lowlights of our experience in el Sur. After we had such an unforgettable dinner we decided to go there also for lunch next day.  In short:  1) the bread was from last night, but we were still ok with it 2) I suspect the same of the salmon skewer I took, as the cheese on top was so hard, that I hardly could cut it.  3) apart from the fact that the paella was not served in a pan and with a traditional crust, it was too salty and the portion was small So at the end we remained with a bit of the sour taste and the lunch made fade away our excitement from dinner.  The thing that a bit saved the situation was the fact that we did not pay for paella. And that we were proposed some digestive liquor.  So for conclusion, I can recommend the place, but only for dinner.",2016-01-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2220-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_22567,0.037,0.834,0.128,0.9849,0.0934382891414141,0.5239583333333333,0.4150277777777778,1617,158,0.0977118119975262,10,39,False,72,0.1,0.1,0.325,0.05,0.15,0.025,0.025,0.05,0.15,0.025,303,185,4.313531353135313,0,0,friend went madrid weekend realli care select place dinner taberna el sur great discoveri us close locat hotel atocha mainli posit review reason price inde dinner beyond expect came later book manag place realli nice rearrang tabl us wait dish brought homemad bread gosh danger order two portion friend took salmon skewer went waiter suggest solomila sur gastronom perfect pork meat red wine sauc bake potato complet new sweet n salti tast cours got sangria anoth highlight place come lowlight experi el sur unforgett dinner decid go also lunch next day short bread last night still ok suspect salmon skewer took chees top hard hardli could cut apart fact paella serv pan tradit crust salti portion small end remain bit sour tast lunch made fade away excit dinner thing bit save situat fact pay paella propos digest liquor conclus recommend place dinner,bad review,2,Spanish

We'd tried to eat here a couple of times previously, but were not able to get in owing to its small size and popularity, largely I think due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on TA.  So, to cut to the chase, the high TA ranking and reviews are misleading -- generally I think reading TA reviews are valuable, and I can sort through and identify ones written by individuals who have a good breadth/depth of experience in dining etc. that carry more weight with me to identify good places to try. And I love writing reviews for places I discover that I'm a huge fan of or have a really great experience I want to share. But I must say the ranking here is grossly over-rated and well, undeserved. I think a couple of things are going on here: (1) confirmation bias, i.e., self-validating crowd effect, people read the glowing reviews and really wanting to enjoy/share the fun ""discovery"" of a very small, quaint but excellent restaurant so they agree with the ""herd"" and write a great review, (2) the charming owner who appears to personally visit and chat with every table, making it hard to write anything negative, given the restaurant is so small and clearly a very personal endeavor, and (3) the owners' repeated request of diners to write reviews on TA -- we were asked probably no less than 4 times during our meal to do so. I can't recall anywhere else I've eaten where I've been directly asked to write a TA review. I've waited more than a week to write this to separate the ""personal"" exhortation of the owner/chef from my true evaluation of the food and experience; I too, would likely have ranked it higher if I'd done this review last week, partly out of guilt.  So, my opinion is overall the food is simply average - not bad - just meh; clearly the chef/owner is ambitious and wants it to be more - the presentation is above average, but the execution is middling. We had a wok lomo buried in a cloying, syrupy sauce; the popular brochettes of calamari and shrimp looked great, but it's friend seafood, and have had much better many other places. A merluza entree was just ok. Nothing on the menu is particularly inventive/original. For Spanish/Asian fusion, I'm much more impressed with Yakitoro in Madrid. I'll admit, other dishes we saw served to other tables all looked appetizing - and people seemed to enjoy themselves and devour the food. But we were really left thinking ""Huh? What's all the fuss about?"" I just can't join the crowd of lemmings to rush in praising this place as one of Madrid's best restaurants - it's not. I can't see it being near the top 50 or even 100. Principally I'm writing this to reset TA readers' expectations -- yes, we enjoyed our meal and would go back, but not at the expense of any great effort to do so in the near term. There's plenty of other restaurants in Madrid I would prefer and prefer to take friends/guests out to. So don't feel you're missing out if you can't score a reservation for this tiny restaurant. Lastly, and not really to pile on, but its NOISY. Essentially a very small ""cube"" with bare walls. The sound ricochets and really degrades the overall experience. Simple baffles/sound proofing -- or even art on the walls -- could fix some of this. And its size means the seating is squeezed very tight, so how much it impacts your experience likely a factor of your mood/tolerance for both the noise and lack of space between other tables.",2015-10-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or260-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_15278,0.052,0.754,0.195,0.999,0.1669176458462172,0.4527293341579056,0.5062153846153846,3530,280,0.0793201133144475,0,125,False,115,0.0814814814814814,0.1185185185185185,0.2444444444444444,0.037037037037037,0.1555555555555555,0.0444444444444444,0.037037037037037,0.0518518518518518,0.1481481481481481,0.0814814814814814,633,353,4.575039494470774,0,0,difficult review write realli want like place ta creat high expect tri eat coupl time previous abl get owe small size popular larg think due overwhelmingli posit review ta cut chase high ta rank review mislead gener think read ta review valuabl sort identifi one written individu good breadth depth experi dine etc carri weight identifi good place tri love write review place discov huge fan realli great experi want share must say rank grossli rate well undeserv think coupl thing go confirm bia e self valid crowd effect peopl read glow review realli want enjoy share fun discoveri small quaint excel restaur agre herd write great review charm owner appear person visit chat everi tabl make hard write anyth neg given restaur small clearli person endeavor owner repeat request diner write review ta ask probabl less time meal recal anywher els eaten directli ask write ta review wait week write separ person exhort owner chef true evalu food experi would like rank higher done review last week partli guilt opinion overal food simpli averag bad meh clearli chef owner ambiti want present averag execut middl wok lomo buri cloy syrupi sauc popular brochett calamari shrimp look great friend seafood much better mani place merluza entre ok noth menu particularli invent origin spanish asian fusion much impress yakitoro madrid admit dish saw serv tabl look appet peopl seem enjoy devour food realli left think huh fuss join crowd lem rush prais place one madrid best restaur see near top even princip write reset ta reader expect ye enjoy meal would go back expens great effort near term plenti restaur madrid would prefer prefer take friend guest feel miss score reserv tini restaur lastli realli pile noisi essenti small cube bare wall sound ricochet realli degrad overal experi simpl baffl sound proof even art wall could fix size mean seat squeez tight much impact experi like factor mood toler nois lack space tabl,average review,3,Spanish

My wife scouted this place out (on her birthday) on our way back from a Segovia and Escorial day trip. Our reservations were at 10:30 pm. It was still kind of light out when we sat down.  Treated like old friends from the get go---From start to finish by all three of our hosts. Great (inexpensive) wine.  My family (Wife; 13and 16) basically ordered one of everything. Korean dumplings -yowza! Pan-fried/honey glazed Artichoke hearts -- had to have been hand peeled! Fried Canary island cheese with mojo rojo sauce--- increible!!! The dinners were astounding ---  Perfectly seared (and super-fresh) tuna with caramelized red peppers. ?What?!??  Pork with garlic/parsley/Mushrooms perfectly browned and deliciously sauced.  Avila beef with mushrooms. ""THAT'S the sauce I want to be able to make"" sez the birthday girl! And the HUGE Avila filet (cooked as rare as you want it!) with Pedro Ximenez sherry reduction. Dang!!!! Finished with a completely delicious hand made, warm cinnamon-rollesque type of dessert with vanilla ice cream added. And of course we were treated to a delicious Asturian herbal digestiv to finish.  DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!! GET RESERVATIONS!! It's TINY!

Not being drinkers we could have easily assumed this was just a bar as the dining tables are situated at the back. As we also don't eat red meat we sometimes don't get the red carpet treatment, but not in this case. Our waiters Hoan and Chris couldn't have been more helpful. The goats cheese salad followed by salmon skewers were both delicious and nutritious, a combination sometimes not easy to find in Spain.

The food was absolutely delicious, and good size portions. There is a lot of options from seafood, to meat, and also some tapas if that's what you wanted to try. We had the sorpresa de jamon, as welll as the lomo de ternero con guarniciones. I can't say enough about how amazing these dishes were. As the appetizer, my boyfriend and i shared the Jamon Iberico plate, which was quite a big portion, and super delicious so give it a try! For dessert, we tried the brownie and ice cream which was as delicious as the rest of the meal. Now for the real seller of this restaurant... the incredible service. Our server Ruben has got to be literally the nicest server I have ever had a pleasure of dealing with. He was kind, patient, made us laugh until our stomachs hurt, and was just a magnificent person. He radiates happiness, and shows an unparalleled passion for his job. Wow is all I can say. He took the time to review almost every item on the menu for us because despite us speaking Spanish, we still were not sure what some of the dishes were. He spoke to us about the best places to eat Paella, and gave us recommendations for other places to visit in Spain. Close to the time we were leaving, the restaurant owner spoke to us for close to five minutes about his recent trip to Cuba (where I am from), and made us feel so welcome and happy. Truly an amazing experience. All in all, this restaurant is a MUST in Madrid. It is small, however, so make reservations ahead of time! Please don't miss the opportunity to have amazing food, with super memorable service that will have you leaving with the biggest smile. I will definitely come back to Madrid just for this restaurant in all honesty.",2016-06-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or190-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_22589,0.027,0.732,0.241,0.9981,0.4448232323232324,0.5893097643097643,0.43845,1799,165,0.0917176209005002,2,50,False,89,0.1466666666666666,0.2,0.32,0.0933333333333333,0.1466666666666666,0.0133333333333333,0.0,0.0133333333333333,0.0533333333333333,0.0133333333333333,334,207,4.389221556886228,0,0,definit one best restaur best ever eaten travel quit bit food absolut delici good size portion lot option seafood meat also tapa want tri sorpresa de jamon welll lomo de ternero con guarnicion say enough amaz dish appet boyfriend share jamon iberico plate quit big portion super delici give tri dessert tri browni ice cream delici rest meal real seller restaur incred servic server ruben got liter nicest server ever pleasur deal kind patient made us laugh stomach hurt magnific person radiat happi show unparallel passion job wow say took time review almost everi item menu us despit us speak spanish still sure dish spoke us best place eat paella gave us recommend place visit spain close time leav restaur owner spoke us close five minut recent trip cuba made us feel welcom happi truli amaz experi restaur must madrid small howev make reserv ahead time pleas miss opportun amaz food super memor servic leav biggest smile definit come back madrid restaur honesti,very good review,5,Spanish

We made our reservation over a month ago and are so glad we did! We ordered the Burratta dish and the Candied Artichokes dish as starters and they were different and delicious than anything we have had before (and we are world travelers). The presentation is lovely. The host and servers tended to every need. For our main course we ordered the octopus dish, the french hamburger with goat cheese, the pork beef dish and the diced beef with yellow peppers dish. They were all fantastic. Perfect temperature, fresh ingredients, full of flavor. I highly recommend you make a reservation today for months down the road if you are even just thinking about it! There were many turned away during our time there. They even called us a cab at the end of our meal. It is a tiny venue with about 10 tables max.

Our first surprise was watching the bartender ""Poppy"" as he expertly crafted a Pisco Sour cocktail with a lovely hand decorated pattern of bitters in its foamy crown and a carved lemon twist smiling from its martini glass rim. He moved on to a Mojito that was equally well done with a veritable bouquet of mint within and without. A very friendly server, Chris the actual head bartender who had entrusted the bar to his able back-up, welcomed us and got us seated pretty quickly. There was a blackboard with a few specials of the day and their brief menu starred with items that were their ""winners"". Their bread, Chris informed us, was house-made as were their desserts. The listed menu options were all ""made from scratch"", thus somewhat limited. I smiled at that, knowing that fewer choices are often better when it comes to focused effort towards perfection in a kitchen. I won't bore you with every detail of our meal, but hit a few highlights. Eat the Moussaka! Eat their salads, the Ropa Vieja, Huevos Rotas, Salmon skewers (don't worry that they melt cheese over them, damn it, they're spectacular). Each sauce, for each dish was wonderfully complex and paired beautifully. The presentations could use a little more panache but flavors don't lie. One thing more, we split the salad (Chris' suggestion) but it was plenty for both of us and was dressed with a true, slow reduction balsamic, pickled onion infusion, and fresh orange bits that wowed me. And yes we had cocktails. You betcha! Yes, we had dessert - we split that lime cheese cake and almost cried it was so good, thanks to Vanessa's care, we were told, in bringing us her mother's recipe. Chris topped us off with a complimentary ""digustion"" of house made melon and vodka that I can still taste! Don't miss this gem. As a matter of fact, we were so happy we went back with our family and had an even better time with Vannessa's brother Alex looking out for us, making great suggestions, and even playing the guitar for a guest as the whole place sang ""Happy Birthday"" in Spanish! Chris, now behind the bar, masterfully created strawberry flowers to adorn his concoctions and a little complimentary strawberry-puree aperitif for our whole group of new friends as we waited to be seated. The evening ended with similar results; happy and well-fed guests!",2016-01-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2220-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_22599,0.04,0.702,0.257,0.9992,0.2738820346320346,0.4927813852813851,0.553925,2766,201,0.0726681127982646,5,95,False,75,0.1217391304347826,0.1565217391304348,0.2347826086956521,0.0782608695652174,0.1478260869565217,0.0347826086956521,0.0347826086956521,0.0260869565217391,0.1130434782608695,0.0521739130434782,481,321,4.750519750519751,0,0,ok food snob experienc chef world cuisin come spain like trip food mecca still suffer jet lag look quick inexpens meal close hotel wife figur mayb luck recommend taberna el sur review seem good spanish unnecessari english speak staff enter crowd bar entri lower expect first surpris watch bartend poppi expertli craft pisco sour cocktail love hand decor pattern bitter foami crown carv lemon twist smile martini glass rim move mojito equal well done verit bouquet mint within without friendli server chri actual head bartend entrust bar abl back welcom us got us seat pretti quickli blackboard special day brief menu star item winner bread chri inform us hous made dessert list menu option made scratch thu somewhat limit smile know fewer choic often better come focus effort toward perfect kitchen bore everi detail meal hit highlight eat moussaka eat salad ropa vieja huevo rota salmon skewer worri melt chees damn spectacular sauc dish wonder complex pair beauti present could use littl panach flavor lie one thing split salad chri suggest plenti us dress true slow reduct balsam pickl onion infus fresh orang bit wow ye cocktail betcha ye dessert split lime chees cake almost cri good thank vanessa care told bring us mother recip chri top us complimentari digust hous made melon vodka still tast miss gem matter fact happi went back famili even better time vannessa brother alex look us make great suggest even play guitar guest whole place sang happi birthday spanish chri behind bar master creat strawberri flower adorn concoct littl complimentari strawberri pure aperitif whole group new friend wait seat even end similar result happi well fed guest,good review,4,Spanish

The dishes were generally quite good, with one exception (the sea bass was chock-full of bones, and it was downright oily). The owner was incredibly attentive, but overall it was not the enjoyable experience we had hoped. Still, I believe that was an anomaly on a bad day. The other dishes we ordered were quite good. The menu de l dia was about 14 EUR, including wine and bread, and the standouts were the starters (creamy, savory ""red"" risotto and a lip-smacking grilled goat cheese salad) and a dessert of mascarpone yogurt and 'fruits of the forest,"" served in a charming canning jar. My companion's main--pork medallions in mustard-pineapple sauce--was tender and flavorful. The wines were a slight disappointment given the tenor of the restaurant, but I wonder if our server erred: our wines were not what other diners were served.

On the evening of our visit, all tables were occupied within fifteen minutes after opening. Very poor chances for a sudden visit. We enjoyed their tasting menu ”C” which was more than enough to make you content. After the kitchens´ greeting, we had first three appetizers to share. All of them (squid and shrimp skewers, grilled cheese and braised octopus) were tasty but the grilled cheese was our favourite. As mains we had beef tenderloin and tuna which both were tasty but we were all too full to eat everything on our plates and also we wished to leave some room for the dessert. We had white chocolate sablé and passion fruit to finish our dinner. Finally we were offered herbal liqueur Licor de Hierbas as a (well needed) digestive.

At first when you walk in, as an American, you find yourself here in a little different setting. Its very local in here and dinner is served typically later than usual for us Yankees. I think we had the first reservation and that wasn't until 730 or 8:30 I can't remember exactly. None of which matters at all because the next 2-3 hours were all fantastic! The place wasn't actually open yet for dinner service when we arrived but the bar was alive with patrons so we helped ourselves to it and had some wine. Both gentlemen working were less than fluent in English but made up for that with their cheery dispositions. At the end of the night it becomes clear to the visitor why they seemed so glad to be at work on a Wed night. After a few glasses we warmed up and so did the place. There are some fun things on the wall in the bar area which led me to believe this was some sort of Italian styled Spanish place so the bar-man explained as best he could that it was and more, much more, with a little Asian influence as well.  Listen, I've already said too much. The bottom line is if you are reading this you can stop now. Just go. Get the chef's tasting menu and take your time and enjoy. The more you enjoy the more this place especially the chef and his creations will enjoy you. And that is why the staff was so happy.

The good news: we got to dine at Bahia Taverna! What a delightful surprise in Barajas, booked online and hoped for the best for our unplanned layover. Got a call early on the day we were leaving for Madrid to confirm our dinner reservations for the next evening and suddenly our mood lifted in expectation of a great meal ... we were not disappointed! We reserved for 2000 due to an early flight the next morning, early for us and way too early for Madrid as the kitchen did not even open till 2030. We waited at the bar enjoying a glass of the excellent Privat Cava in the casually elegant restaurant. The front room has high tables reserved for tapas and the rear area facing the open kitchen is set up as the more formal dining area for the degustation menu. Reservations are a must for either room as by 2100 every table was full and it was standing room only at the bar. The crowd is hip and stylish and very, very local as Barajas is a quiet town far from the Madrid city center. The menu was varied and inventive and featured lots of seafood. The unexpected food pairings, all dramatically presented, were a feast for all the senses and we opted for our waiter's excellent recommendations for the wine pairing for each course. We were surprised, tantalized and totally seduced by the spectacular tapas, the excellent wines and the attentive service. Although the restaurant was full there was never a lapse in service, and even the gentleman that called us stopped by to say hello, a very personal touch indeed. We certainly did not expect that one of the finest meals we have ever enjoyed would be in Barajas, we would travel there again when in Madrid just for the pleasure of dining at Bahia Taverna again",2015-12-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d803211-Reviews-or50-Bahia_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_72,0.03,0.827,0.143,0.9913,0.2754294217687074,0.5952721088435373,0.5256,1811,157,0.0866924351187189,2,29,False,63,0.0933333333333333,0.1333333333333333,0.28,0.0933333333333333,0.16,0.0266666666666666,0.0266666666666666,0.0666666666666666,0.08,0.04,330,189,4.490909090909091,0,0,bad news due schedul chang iberia forc spend night baraja good news got dine bahia taverna delight surpris baraja book onlin hope best unplan layov got call earli day leav madrid confirm dinner reserv next even suddenli mood lift expect great meal disappoint reserv due earli flight next morn earli us way earli madrid kitchen even open till wait bar enjoy glass excel privat cava casual eleg restaur front room high tabl reserv tapa rear area face open kitchen set formal dine area degust menu reserv must either room everi tabl full stand room bar crowd hip stylish local baraja quiet town far madrid citi center menu vari invent featur lot seafood unexpect food pair dramat present feast sens opt waiter excel recommend wine pair cours surpris tantal total seduc spectacular tapa excel wine attent servic although restaur full never laps servic even gentleman call us stop say hello person touch inde certainli expect one finest meal ever enjoy would baraja would travel madrid pleasur dine bahia taverna,good review,4,Spanish

When our friends in Madrid asked where we were dining and we said Barajas the immediate response was .. Pero Porque? We took the direct 5 metro from Madrid Centro to Alameda de Osuna, about 20 minutes. Although there is a bus connection to Calle Bahia de Palma we opted for the short cab ride to the restaurant and also back to the metro stop. Having enjoyed hors oeuvres and an aperitif with friends prior to our meal we opted to start with the four step menu instead of the eight step we so enjoyed on our last visit. The icy cold cava was beautifully dry and elegant to start and we chose the wine pairing as well for our meal. Our meal was as satisfying to the eye and the palate as on last visit, always inventive and wonderfully fresh. We had cauliflower in a mayonnaise sauce topped with red and black caviar that was cool and sumptuous as a first course, followed by a deliciously tender and succulent filleted sardine tartare, next an inventive and surprising take on ossobuco and finished with their rabo de toro interpretation which we so enjoyed before. All dishes were beautifully paired with wines from Spain, the white from La Mancha was simply spectacular. After all that cava and wine we can't recollect what was had for dessert, just know that it was good!

The long menu adds an additional main course for 9 EUR more. I made a reservation a few months in advance, but it was not crowded when I visited on a weeknight. In the future, I would dine at the high tables, where I can order more freely off the menu. The low tables are restricted to the tasting menus only. The wait staff were very good and spoke very good English, bringing free bread refills too! In a few words; spectacular, playful, delicious. I'll let my pictures do the talking. If I had one critique, I would say that maybe there was too much use of mayonnaise (as delicious as it was)?",2015-10-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d803211-Reviews-or50-Bahia_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_22631,0.035,0.781,0.184,0.9877,0.3158666666666667,0.4863333333333333,0.5859333333333333,997,81,0.0812437311935807,2,35,False,43,0.1346153846153846,0.1923076923076923,0.3076923076923077,0.1153846153846153,0.1346153846153846,0.0384615384615384,0.0,0.0192307692307692,0.0576923076923076,0.0,184,136,4.423913043478261,0,0,love hole wall unassum restaur bahia taberna one stay hilton madrid airport perfect place dine locat min away hotel would never guess magnitud culinari experi suburban locat dine low tabl cours amus extra dessert tast menu eur bargain long menu add addit main cours eur made reserv month advanc crowd visit weeknight futur would dine high tabl order freeli menu low tabl restrict tast menu wait staff good spoke good english bring free bread refil word spectacular play delici let pictur talk one critiqu would say mayb much use mayonnais delici,good review,4,Spanish

But then one should know beforehand as the name 'Taberna' implies. We were being seated at the high tables, and only after much clarification that we will be having the tasting menu (most staff speaks minimal English) that we were directed to the main restaurant with clothed tables. I find it strange that while they serve a tasting menu, they don't understand the concept of wine pairing... The dishes were all prettily and artfully presented, but come to think of it, they are mostly pub food in essence: cucumber and beans pate; squid tempura; garden peas, pea shoots, pea purée n Burrata... The squid tomato bruschetta must have been their signature dish. It was brilliant, but still, it was just a Burrata. Deep fried Chicken wings and soft shell crabs...followed by fish tartar! Seriously? Braised Oxtail was delicious, but 3 big pieces for a tasting menu was a bit over generous. The weakest link however was in the desserts, which ended up lame and anticlimactic.

Sometimes the pairings were served before the course, sometimes afterwards, little details. That all being said, was our best meal thus far in Madrid.

Located in a very upscale area, but nice and cosy...  I knew we were in for something special when, just after we were seated, our server brought us 2 perfect looking cherries with stems on a white plate. Alright, let's go with it... we popped them in and realized they were not cherries, but unbelievably delicious balls of fois gras made to look like cherries. Wow. We selected this place because the specialized in raw tuna dishes, and those were indeed spectacular, but everything was great. A must have, and you're going to have to trust me on this, is what can only be called a slab of tomato. You'll see photos scattered through the gallery... Giant tomato slice, a touch of olive oil, and this amazing shaved sea salt (you'll find it everywhere) - That's it, and it so works. We also had the wild mushroom cannoli - also amazing, and then 2 different raw tuna dishes.

We reserved a week before and they were expecting us (I suspect we need not have because few people eat out on Sunday evening). We ordered a couples of cañas and the menu. Having looked through it I got a feeling that they would look after us come what may. I simply said no red meat but chicken is OK and fish is OK. You bought it - you cooked it so you choose it. Starters mains and the only thing I'd say is we like red wine over white whether it's fish or fowl. The starters arrived and were delicious. The main courses arrived and were exceptional (especially for the money). We were advised to have a wine NOT on the menu because it was both better and cheaper than the Ribera del Duero on the card. They only had one portion of lemon pudding (a sort of English type of Lemon meringue pie. It was large and we shared.

It was a Saturday night and the place was pretty quiet (though Madrid tends to be quiet in August). It doesn't look like much from the outside: more front-room-made-restaurant than anything else.  But I'd read good things, and appearance isn't everything.  The food was...amazing. Empanadas were really flavoursome, and the burrata was beautiful. Highly recommend both.  Then, what we came for, the Argentinian meats. Didn't disappoint, as we'd pigged out on the starters, we didn't end up going for the larger sharing cuts, so among the four of us we ordered the entraña, vacio, entrecot and lomo Argentino especialidad de la casa. The entraña was exquisite, the lomo too. They were all cooked perfectly and we're obviously a good quality. Ranging between 17-22€, good value for the area too.  Can't go wrong with dulce de leche for postre either!!  The service was very fast and very friendly, this was probably my favourite thing and considering how much I enjoyed the food, that says something. It felt very homely.  I'd say the only thing that let it down was the strange pricing of the drinks: 17€ for a supermarket wine (Cune) and 6€ for a bottle of still water took away from the charming aspect of everything else, I'd pay more for the meat without complaining because it's worth it...but don't charge 6€ for water!

Unlike restaurants that look expensive are expensive and where you expect the food to taste amazing but are ultimately disappointed, this place from the outside is easy to miss and does not necessarily look like a restaurant but don't get fooled by the looks. The food is delicious. The starters are amazing. We had the chorizo, provoletta and buratta as starters. One was better than the other. The chorizo comes with chimichurri that is one of the best recipes I have tried in Madrid. I love chimichurri and have high expectations to it. The owner explained that the recipe is from her grandfather and a family sauce. For the main dish we had the ojo de lomo argentino that comes already sliced. Delicious.

Having read some previous reviews, I was rather dreading it since we usually go to Michelin-starred restaurants in whatever gear we have on and the whole place sounded too formal. But really, the jacket and tie business is simply arranged - they warn you on the phone when you make the reservation and when you arrive, you are whisked away to a cloakroom where a nice lady efficiently kits you out. We had dinner on a Friday night - the place was packed, apparently mostly with Spanish patrons. Tables are nicely-spaced out, comfortable seats, a warm rich decor. We had the tasting menu which is around Euros 100 per person, with very generous-sized portions for each course so you need to be hungry. The menu was a strange dichotomy : more modern dishes to start and more traditional dishes as you progressed. Lots of sauces which I found a little heavy. The (mostly older) waiters are involved in cooking, plating, flambeeing etc., which is always entertaining to watch and at which they are very skilled. The dishes in the tasting menu were well-executed, with the exception of a venison dish where the meat was a thin overcooked medallion, in a sickly sauce which wasn't doing anyone any favours. Looking at the other tables, steak tartare and seafood/lobster salad seemed to be extremely popular. The wine list is extensive and very reasonably-priced. Service was attentive but occasionally too brisk. My husband's plate was whipped away when he hadn't yet finished and we barely had time to sample the tapas/canapes before they too were whipped away as our first courses arrived. But the waiters and sommelier were friendly enough - it's certainly not stuffy or formal and what I would expect from fine dining. While we prefer more modern-style cooking and dining, sometimes it's good to go to a traditional place like this for a change. The restaurant has obviously maintained its high standard and popularity over decades which is impressive. Besides...how often can you say that you've eaten at the same restaurant as the King and Queen of Spain?(!!)",2014-11-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d718435-Reviews-or50-Zalacain-Madrid.html,UID_22740,0.014,0.845,0.141,0.9953,0.1827895021645021,0.4856222943722945,0.4825,2242,185,0.0825156110615521,2,65,False,71,0.2075471698113207,0.0943396226415094,0.3018867924528302,0.0566037735849056,0.1509433962264151,0.0,0.0188679245283018,0.0566037735849056,0.0754716981132075,0.0377358490566037,380,241,4.902631578947369,0,0,sinc eaten sort old fashion high end restaur enforc dress code men waiter still help prepar food read previou review rather dread sinc usual go michelin star restaur whatev gear whole place sound formal realli jacket tie busi simpli arrang warn phone make reserv arriv whisk away cloakroom nice ladi effici kit dinner friday night place pack appar mostli spanish patron tabl nice space comfort seat warm rich decor tast menu around euro per person gener size portion cours need hungri menu strang dichotomi modern dish start tradit dish progress lot sauc found littl heavi mostli older waiter involv cook plate flambe etc alway entertain watch skill dish tast menu well execut except venison dish meat thin overcook medallion sickli sauc anyon favour look tabl steak tartar seafood lobster salad seem extrem popular wine list extens reason price servic attent occasion brisk husband plate whip away yet finish bare time sampl tapa canap whip away first cours arriv waiter sommeli friendli enough certainli stuffi formal would expect fine dine prefer modern style cook dine sometim good go tradit place like chang restaur obvious maintain high standard popular decad impress besid often say eaten restaur king queen spain,good review,4,Spanish

It was 9:00 and we were the only ones there, even when we left it was quiet. We had the Paella ""A Banda"" with grilled Seafood served separately.

The pinchos (snacks) menu is small, but exciting. I only glanced at the main menu as I thought it was overpriced, as were the pinchos, but not as bad everything else. In short, the food I had was superb. I ordered 2 different pinchos, which are similar to bruschetta in that they come on crusty bread. 2 was almost enough for a full meal, though I was still a little hungry afterward. One was soy sauce marinated chicken with caramelized onions and corn mousse and a sesame oil drizzle. The saltiness of the chicken was beautiful with the smooth, sweet-ish mousse and onions. The second pincho was ratatouille topped with a perfectly-fried quail egg and a little crispy ham. Also heavenly.

We arrived early as we had a morning flight and were the first table to be seated. We were seated at a table where the paint had started to peel off the wall. The decor is a bit confusing, a mix of old wooden beams that could be a great feature, combined with loud colours on the wall of alternating turquoise and green.  We ordered some shellfish starters and a seafood paella, after all it's a seafood restaurant. The seafood paella was beautifully presented, with crabs, lobsters, prawns etc. on display. The problem is that we wanted a meal that we could eat as well as admire. There was virtually no substance to the various decorative sealife and it was a major effort to get anything out of the shells as they were so small. Rice was average. Nothing to write home about.

The only one in Spain. It lost 2 stars in 1995 and has never gained them back. I thought at the time that Zalacain was highly overrated and Michelin finally agreed. The restaurant is quite attractive, but it lacks that din, or buzz of energy, of the greatest restaurants. The service is slightly haughty and perfunctory, but polished. Let's look at the menu. They offer a couple of different Prix Fixe menu's at €99/person and €105/person. Al la carte, for me starts with Ravioli stuffed with wild mushrooms and fresh goose-liver with “Melanosportum” truffle, or  Prawns macerated with avocado and orange salad, or Terrine of fresh goose-liver with marmalade and purée of apple. For main's, I suggest the Grilled Fresh Goose Liver with Pedro Ximenez Sauce and dried peach, or Wild Mushrooms and Fresh Goose Liver Lasagne, or Sirloin with Wild Mushroom Sauce and fresh goose liver. Dessert? Very pretty: meringue cake with violet’s ice-cream, or almond roof-tile and mignardises. Figure to spend €100-€125/person without drinks and wine. The wine list is comprehensive and over priced. DiverXO, the latest, and only existing 3 star restaurant in Madrid, is vastly superior.  As are the two-star Santceloni and La Terraza del Casino. As well as, Sergi Arola, El Club Allard and Ramon Freixa Madrid.",2016-02-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d718435-Reviews-or30-Zalacain-Madrid.html,UID_22764,0.013,0.827,0.16,0.99,0.2097916666666666,0.6113888888888889,0.419925,1386,92,0.0663780663780663,0,46,False,38,0.175,0.1,0.275,0.05,0.15,0.025,0.025,0.025,0.125,0.05,229,159,5.048034934497816,0,0,first went zalacain late eighti restaur michelin star one spain lost star never gain back thought time zalacain highli overr michelin final agre restaur quit attract lack din buzz energi greatest restaur servic slightli haughti perfunctori polish let look menu offer coupl differ prix fix menu person person al la cart start ravioli stuf wild mushroom fresh goos liver melanosportum truffl prawn macer avocado orang salad terrin fresh goos liver marmalad pur e appl main suggest grill fresh goos liver pedro ximenez sauc dri peach wild mushroom fresh goos liver lasagn sirloin wild mushroom sauc fresh goos liver dessert pretti meringu cake violet ice cream almond roof tile mignardis figur spend person without drink wine wine list comprehens price diverxo latest exist star restaur madrid vastli superior two star santceloni la terraza del casino well sergi arola el club allard ramon freixa madrid,average review,3,Spanish

I was drawn to this establishment like a moth to a flame. I knew all about its stiff and stuffy dress code - one is reminded whilst booking ""that a gentlemen wears a jacket and tie."" I was even aware of its recently lost Michelin star. However, its overly conservative and traditional style as well as a menu I can understand meant that wanted to give it a go.  Okay, my wife and I turn up and gulp at the prices at the entrance. One deep breath and we enter. It's a warm welcome and I'm aware that we've passed Zalacain's grooming criteria. I have to say that from that moment on we were treated with the utmost courtesy and exemplary professionalism. You should expect that from a place like this but staff were also warm and friendly too.  Aided by a first class sommelier I choose a bottle of wine from a huge wine list. This is the cue for the arrival of some pre starter amuse bouche and tasty nibbles. Be warned, you will be charged for anything that is placed on the table - nothing is free, including the miniature bread rolls you don't eat. My wife starts with partridge and I go for the ravioli. Both are tasty in a traditional sense but lack the excitement and drama I want in a top establishment. For my main I opt for a Zalacain classic, the lobster salad. It's delicious fresh lobster on a bed of ordinary lettuce and way too much creamy dressing. I can't give the chef any kind of compliment. My wife opts for goose liver (it's not foie gras) with pedro ximenez and it gets a firm thumbs up. We finish with fresh seasonal raspberries. Our fellow guests consist of a couple of business men that look as though they eat here regularly; an older Madridleno couple and ghastly table of ten straight out of casting for Madrid Wives. I'm left with the impression that Zalacain is as much a social club for the conservative wealth of Madrid as much as restaurant. Despite the excellent service I get a feeling that they are going through the motions. The food lacked flair and I'm not surprised they lost the Michelin star. It's not cheap, far from it, but I would say do it once for experience. It's too expensive for top marks but despite all my reservations we had an enjoyable and memorable meal.",2015-12-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d718435-Reviews-or30-Zalacain-Madrid.html,UID_22765,0.042,0.815,0.143,0.9922,0.2421550671550671,0.5303418803418803,0.437448,2303,204,0.0885801128962223,0,52,False,66,0.13,0.14,0.31,0.08,0.15,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,0.04,427,254,4.391100702576113,0,0,sometim pay pleasur meal zalacain fall categori drawn establish like moth flame knew stiff stuffi dress code one remind whilst book gentlemen wear jacket tie even awar recent lost michelin star howev overli conserv tradit style well menu understand meant want give go okay wife turn gulp price entranc one deep breath enter warm welcom awar pass zalacain groom criteria say moment treat utmost courtesi exemplari profession expect place like staff also warm friendli aid first class sommeli choos bottl wine huge wine list cue arriv pre starter amus bouch tasti nibbl warn charg anyth place tabl noth free includ miniatur bread roll eat wife start partridg go ravioli tasti tradit sens lack excit drama want top establish main opt zalacain classic lobster salad delici fresh lobster bed ordinari lettuc way much creami dress give chef kind compliment wife opt goos liver foie gra pedro ximenez get firm thumb finish fresh season raspberri fellow guest consist coupl busi men look though eat regularli older madridleno coupl ghastli tabl ten straight cast madrid wive left impress zalacain much social club conserv wealth madrid much restaur despit excel servic get feel go motion food lack flair surpris lost michelin star cheap far would say experi expens top mark despit reserv enjoy memor meal,good review,4,Spanish

Service was attentive to the point of being overbearing when we arrived at 9pm as the first customers but remained excellent as the restaurant filled up. Good bread and starters as you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. Our starters were excellent, I really enjoyed my mackerel salad but was envious of my wife's ravioli which were phenomenal. My main was quirky as port trotters stuffed with lamb in a mustard source made for an odd combination of meat flavours but pleasant enough, bizarrely served with tempura style vegetables.

Although Zalacain is no longer a Michelin restaurant, the service is on point and the dishes are delicious, not to mention they have hosted the Spanish King and Queen. Want to feel like royalty? Zalacain is the place!  Located in the beautiful neighborhood, you are sure to be met by valet and escorted into the restaurant where, if you are lucky, the owner and his wife will take your coats, seat you at your table and given the menu. Both husband and wife are very warm and personable, make great conversation and recommend some great dishes on the menu. To start, they offer complementary tapas because this is the Spanish way and I am not complaining one bit. Croquets and meats yum! Champagne and wine to celebrate. I ordered a half a dozen of oysters on the half shell to start off with. Oysters were plump and fresh and delicious. My main course, I chose Entrecote de buey al vino tinto con tuetano de ternera joven (beef steak in red wine sauce with young veal bone marrow on top). My steak was perfectly rare for my liking, sauce was luxurious without overpowering the meat and the bone marrow topping took the dish to a whole new level. Wow! We also tried one of their ""classic dishes"" the mushroom and goose liver lasagna which was unlike any lasagna we've ever tasted.

I give high marks to the restaurant serving staff (waiters) all were knowledgeable of the appropriate wine selections, with the various food combinations, and were most courteous and accommodating.

With reference to the food, I must confess that I've had far better, at lower cost. This restaurant is rightly placed in the top 10% of Madrid, and rightly not placed in the coveted top 1% of trip advisor. The food was good, but not great for the price paid, and the menu was very limited.

The service is quite formal but still manages to be warm and friendly. The sommelier was a master sommelier and when he spoke about wine, it sounded like poetry. He just came to us and said, what sort of wine would you like, and we described a few qualities of the wine, then he just thought about it for a minute and recommended one of the hundreds of wines that he knows. It was, of course, an excellent choice. Apart from the unique atmosphere, the food was absolutely great.

Los Porfiados has no pretentions to ""fine dining"" or ""silver service"". No. This is a straight forward meal service in a comfortable setting — a bit like being invited into your best friend's Mum's kitchen. The setting is a reclaimed shop (or so it seems)*. Couches, armchairs and sofas are strewn around, with plenty of reading material. The open-plan kitchen sits off to the side and a few odd tables are placed near by. The menu changes frequently and is based on what is currently available in local markets. There's a distinct leaning towards dishes that originated in South America, but all is wholesome and well priced. Soups and salads; casseroles and empanadas; grills and fries, and plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit. As I wrote: wholesome. The drinks list is brief and basic. But it's there. Service is friendly, and generally helpful. Students like this place. So do couples...and families...and us older folks as well.

The decoration feels spontaneous and undaunting The waiters are really friendly and speak surprinsingly good english. We went there with our 18 month old daughter and found it really handy (and sweet) that they had a baby chair available for their customers. For starters I ordered the Red Peppers Creme and my wife ordered a ""Rafita"" salad, both were excellent. For the main course we both had burgers and I must say it was some of the best meat I had tried in a long time. Apparently the restaurant is 75% argentinian and it shows. They also have a nice selections of beers, I tried Cibeles. I am not usually too enthusiastic about desserts but the Milhojas de Dulce de Leche was delicious. Oh, by the way, they have ILLY coffe, which is always a plus. The price was pretty reasonable, around 15€ a person.

Los Porfiados has welcoming, sweet and fast waiters, plenty of space between the tables, with really likeable-looking people having their meals, and a lovely atmosphere. My partner and I much enjoyed being there, but not the food. We both started with gazpacho, and that was fine. My partner then had quiche, and I something said on the menu to have tenderized beef, with red peppers, nuts and cheese. Whether it was the tenderization or its having been overcooked I don't know, but the meat had no taste whatever; nor had the cheese melted on top, and nobody seemed to have thought of doing anything about this by adding either herbs or spices or even salt of pepper, of which there was none on the table. I only ate it because I didn't want to spoil the evening for my partner by sending it back. For desert I had what we were told would be millefeuille filled with dulce de lece. This sounded a nice idea but proved to be dulce de lece spread between many layers of a thin pastry that had soaked up enough of the filing to turn into something like blotting paper. My partner had no desert, which to go on my experience seemed to have been a good choice. We paid the bill, thanked and shook hands with the waiters and wished them the best with the restaurant which one of them had told us had started only last autumn, and left. It was only then, as my partner asked me what my food had been like and I said all right without any enthusiasm, that she told me her quiche had been pretty poor, without any taste, and I owned up about my stuff. With so much else going for it, if only Los Porfiados found a chef who knew what he/she was doing - which shouldn't be too hard to judge from our experience of much better thought-out and cooked meals in four other Madrid restaurants on the Tripadvisor list (including one with a chef only 21!) - it could turn into something brilliant.",2014-06-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5430372-Reviews-or50-Los_Porfiados-Madrid.html,UID_8767,0.044,0.809,0.147,0.9933,0.2238095238095237,0.6172438672438673,0.4045461538461538,1990,203,0.1020100502512562,1,47,False,68,0.1290322580645161,0.1612903225806451,0.2903225806451613,0.064516129032258,0.1451612903225806,0.032258064516129,0.0483870967741935,0.032258064516129,0.0483870967741935,0.0483870967741935,372,219,4.352150537634409,0,0,know may get brickbat review judg experi lo porfiado welcom sweet fast waiter plenti space tabl realli likeabl look peopl meal love atmospher partner much enjoy food start gazpacho fine partner quich someth said menu tender beef red pepper nut chees whether tender overcook know meat tast whatev chees melt top nobodi seem thought anyth ad either herb spice even salt pepper none tabl ate want spoil even partner send back desert told would millefeuil fill dulc de lece sound nice idea prove dulc de lece spread mani layer thin pastri soak enough file turn someth like blot paper partner desert go experi seem good choic paid bill thank shook hand waiter wish best restaur one told us start last autumn left partner ask food like said right without enthusiasm told quich pretti poor without tast own stuff much els go lo porfiado found chef knew hard judg experi much better thought cook meal four madrid restaur tripadvisor list includ one chef could turn someth brilliant,bad review,2,Spanish

All the tapas we ordered were just delicious, very fresh and well presented. Here you can enjoy „Rabo de toro“ or „Madrid“ – exquisite tapas you won’t find in the next best restaurant/tapas bar. The wine list covers nearly every Spanish wine region and you can be sure to find a good one to accompany your dishes. Casa Lucas offers a nice atmosphere. Clean, simple but not simplistic.  We were sitting on a table next to the bar. Although there was not plenty of space we didn’t feel cramped at all and we really enjoyed being there.

Yes, the area would probably be best described as 'up and coming' in English parlance but the level of intimidation mentioned by other reviewers is a gross over exaggeration in my opinion. It reminded me of Istanbul with groups congregating in the streets but we were left totally to our own devices, none of the groups approached us in any way or made us feel uneasy. They were simply socialising and not waiting to pounce on vulnerable tourists as I've seen some other reviewers suggest. Onto the restaurant itself, after a little difficulty finding it. The venue is very nicely designed but retains a certain intimacy as it only has around ten tables of varying sizes. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very genial waiter who really appreciated our attempts at Spanish while politely correcting and assisting in English where this fell down. The menu itself is very quaintly detailed on a series of cards bound with a key ring with no English tourist translations to be had so you know the focus will be on authentic good food. I had their local take on a hamburger with wonderful fillings and a hand formed burger of medium-rare beef and my wife had a red cabbage and goats cheese quiche. Her quiche was nice but could have done with more goats cheese to counter the slightly overbearing amount of red cabbage. The mains were followed by a delightful selection of desserts from the counter which were all very well made and very tasty. All food is served on beautiful crockery. We found the food and drink to be very good value and the service was great with a host who really appreciated our attempts at the local dialect and engaged with us to improve our knowledge of the language which benefitted us later in the trip.",2014-11-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5430372-Reviews-or40-Los_Porfiados-Madrid.html,UID_22837,0.048,0.745,0.207,0.9969,0.2254446248196248,0.41869227994228,0.4230916666666666,1842,161,0.0874049945711183,0,22,False,52,0.0972222222222222,0.1805555555555555,0.2361111111111111,0.0555555555555555,0.1944444444444444,0.0416666666666666,0.0277777777777777,0.0416666666666666,0.0972222222222222,0.0277777777777777,325,201,4.67076923076923,0,0,firstli feel address comment neighbourhood restaur locat ye area would probabl best describ come english parlanc level intimid mention review gross exagger opinion remind istanbul group congreg street left total devic none group approach us way made us feel uneasi simpli socialis wait pounc vulner tourist seen review suggest onto restaur littl difficulti find venu nice design retain certain intimaci around ten tabl vari size upon arriv greet genial waiter realli appreci attempt spanish polit correct assist english fell menu quaintli detail seri card bound key ring english tourist translat know focu authent good food local take hamburg wonder fill hand form burger medium rare beef wife red cabbag goat chees quich quich nice could done goat chees counter slightli overbear amount red cabbag main follow delight select dessert counter well made tasti food serv beauti crockeri found food drink good valu servic great host realli appreci attempt local dialect engag us improv knowledg languag benefit us later trip,good review,4,Spanish

Right off the bat, the service was perfunctory - if not outright sullen. When we were asked if we wished for water, we stressed ""agua ordinario"" - ""tap water"". The waiter responded ""tap water?"" and we replied ""yes"". Of course, he then brought an open bottle of bottled water, which we sent back, and got the agua del grifo - okay, maybe just a communication error . They then place bread on our plate without asking - of course another 3 Euro charge - no big deal, but if you intend to charge, you should ask first. I think that asking for tap water set the waiter's foul mood - no amount of cajoling or friendliness seemed to help.  When the paella arrived (minimum order two people) it looked very good - and the rice itself was quite good. The problem was that the seafood - it was supposed to be seafood paella - was so minimal that there was virtually nothing but good tasting rice and shells - no seafood contained within the shells of the various crustaceans. No tools... Is this how seafood paella is supposed to be? We were both very disappointed. Good-tasting rice for two people and a small salad should not cost over 60 Euros. (the seafood paella was only available a la carte for two.) That was after we had to correct the bill that was first presented to us. Initially the bill was even higher - they tried to charge us 5.50 Euro (!?) for the bottle of water that we had not ordered - and seemed not in the least surprised when we asked not to be charged for it - I don't particularly care for people trying to scam me.  In short - very good tasting rice - lousy seafood paella (as a finished dish beyond the rice), AWFUL service - and dishonest billing.

The top factor I consider when reviewing a restaurant is “did I get my money’s worth?” With our first visit to Zalacain, we left with no doubts about it being worth every Euro. Why?   From my first phone call to book a table to the parting good-by after midnight, everything seen, heard, done and swallowed was perfect. And it’s not just a matter of value for the money.  Ambiance, quality, demonstrated experience, qualified service staff, fine cellar, top décor and much more add up to the score of 10+++. If I had to compare Zalacain to other properties I know well, I would put it in the class with Munich's Tantris. Elegant, polished, top drawer without being pretentious. If there was any flaw to the evening it was in that we probably drank too much, but perfectly matched wines with the “To Know” menu couldn’t be passed up and the service, timing of each course and presentation were exceeded only by the masterpieces of perfection that kept coming from kitchen to our table. If you want top class in every respect of a contemporary, yet classic restaurant in Madrid, this is not to be missed. Zalacain is a short cab ride to the north of Madrid and if you go, take the name and address with you for your taxi driver. Some may not know this well-kept secret. Arrive early (2100 hrs) and expect a full course meal to last at least 2.5-3 hours.  Dress for the occasion. A suit, or at least jacket and tie for the men is required, (thank God), and if you have thoughts about showing up a la typical American casual, try Burger King in the city instead. Our tab was in the range of 300 Euros and worth twice that. We’ll go again, even if we just fly to Madrid for a superb dinner!!! Note: In spite of a fine, detailed web site, I found no way to book with Zalacain on line and, thanks to a friend, made our reservation by telephone from Barcelona.",2012-03-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d718435-Reviews-or90-Zalacain-Madrid.html,UID_22853,0.021,0.8,0.179,0.9954,0.2356203007518796,0.4795426065162907,0.3093294117647059,1896,162,0.0854430379746835,3,61,False,60,0.1666666666666666,0.1111111111111111,0.3472222222222222,0.0694444444444444,0.2083333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0277777777777777,349,226,4.4240687679083095,0,0,singl word restaur grand top factor consid review restaur get money worth first visit zalacain left doubt worth everi euro first phone call book tabl part good midnight everyth seen heard done swallow perfect matter valu money ambianc qualiti demonstr experi qualifi servic staff fine cellar top cor much add score compar zalacain properti know well would put class munich tantri eleg polish top drawer without pretenti flaw even probabl drank much perfectli match wine know menu pass servic time cours present exceed masterpiec perfect kept come kitchen tabl want top class everi respect contemporari yet classic restaur madrid miss zalacain short cab ride north madrid go take name address taxi driver may know well kept secret arriv earli hr expect full cours meal last least hour dress occas suit least jacket tie men requir thank god thought show la typic american casual tri burger king citi instead tab rang euro worth twice go even fli madrid superb dinner note spite fine detail web site found way book zalacain line thank friend made reserv telephon barcelona,good review,4,Spanish

Upon entering, our friends were immediately recognized and given a warm greeting, which was extended to us, by the owner, bartender and server. This open, welcoming attitude carried on throughout the meal, as one of the three consistently stopped to ensure that everything was to our liking. Based on our friend’s recommendation, I had the calamari. This was unlike any calamari dish that I had seen. The squid was cut into approx. 1.5 inch (4 cm) wide strips, which were bound together with a piece of bacon and then deep fried. It was served with garlic aioli and emulsified squid ink. When the food arrived, the waiter asked if I would like for him to prepare it for me. He proceeded to cut the squid and bacon into bit-sized pieces. He then mixed the squid ink and garlic aioli and tossed it all together. The mixed dish looked very unappetizing, but tasted amazing.

Looking for Spanish food in the center area we had found Casa Lucas to be a promising choice. Even on a Tuesday the place was crowded with locals already at 9.15 pm which is very early for Madrilenos. We got a reservation which then got a bit delayed, but the extremely friendly and efficient staff made up for it with small servings on the house with our canas while we were waiting to get seated. At the table we ordered five raciones ranging from squid in ink sauce to salads and canolis and they came gradually and with more canas as they should. At all times we were served with great attention and care despite that the two owners were extremely busy.

The dishes, at least what we ordered, were not as inventive or tasty as other similarly priced and rated restaurants we have been to on other cities. However the experience is worth the visit. The steak with garlic was delicious and perfectly prepared. The sole with white asparagus sauce and mustard too drenched with the sauce and not subtle. The gazpacho was only average, and was the flavor of the shrimp in the shrimp and avocado salad was bland, although the dressing was very good. The cava by the glass; excellent.

The ambient is characteristic, the owner is very friendly but the food is average and the prices not so cheap. We took pintxos (good ones) and as main courses octopus (too much potatoes inside) and fried squid (average). Two very lite beers and two cups of white wine for € 45! My opinion: if you're round here it's ok but don't come on purpose only for eating here. Normally in Madrid you can have lunch for half price at the same quality. #4 on TripAdvisor seems to me a little bit over rated. Ci siamo venuti perché avevamo letto delle ottime recensioni: sarà perché siamo italiani, sarà perché conosciamo bene la Spagna ma il posto non ci è affatto sembrato eccezionale. Certo l'ambiente è carino, il titolare gentile ma il cibo è assolutamente nella media e non è per nulla conveniente. Noi abbiamo preso dei pintxos con una specie di mousse con spinaci, porri e 1 gambero (buona), una tagliata di polpo che non era un granché e con un casino di patate (che si potevano pure evitare) e dei calamari fritti senza infamia e senza lode. 2 minibirrette, 2 bicchieri di vino bianco: € 45! Quindi se siete nei dintorni e ci volete mangiare è ok ma venirci apposta (come abbiamo fatto noi) non ne vale la pena, in giro ci sono un sacco di posti dove a pranzo si spende la metà per mangiare più o meno cose della stessa qualità.

It quickly turned into my place of choice for bringing visiting family members and friends. If you pass through the Mercado de Chamartin during working hours you will be hard pressed to locate the restaurant, but once everyone turns in for their siesta at 2pm, out come the tables and hungry people start arriving just in time for the staff to greet them like family. They have a variety of fresh pasta that you can combine with any of their sauces or you can opt for the daily menu, which includes an appetizer, first and second course, dessert and beverage. Lunch for two is around 20 to 25 Euros which, taking into account the high quality of the food, is astonishingly good value. I have seen food that is x10 worse go for double that price. Attention is first rate, this guys really know how to treat a customer so that they come back. Ingredients are fresh, the food is inspired, desserts are amazing (looking at you, Cannoli and Tiramisu) and you can even buy their pasta,sauces and lasagna to eat at home. Do yourself a favor and reserve a table (highly recommended since they can only field about 8-10 tables plus stools at the bar) and try their no-pretense food that will leave you, and your wallet, feeling good afterwards.",2015-04-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7159688-Reviews-or20-Pasta_Mito-Madrid.html,UID_2294,0.024,0.797,0.179,0.9915,0.1979824561403508,0.457280701754386,0.438225,1295,110,0.0849420849420849,0,29,False,52,0.1126760563380281,0.1408450704225352,0.2394366197183098,0.0985915492957746,0.1549295774647887,0.028169014084507,0.0422535211267605,0.0422535211267605,0.0845070422535211,0.056338028169014,232,162,4.586206896551724,0,0,favorit eateri sinc arriv madrid quickli turn place choic bring visit famili member friend pass mercado de chamartin work hour hard press locat restaur everyon turn siesta pm come tabl hungri peopl start arriv time staff greet like famili varieti fresh pasta combin sauc opt daili menu includ appet first second cours dessert beverag lunch two around euro take account high qualiti food astonishingli good valu seen food x wors go doubl price attent first rate guy realli know treat custom come back ingredi fresh food inspir dessert amaz look cannoli tiramisu even buy pasta sauc lasagna eat home favor reserv tabl highli recommend sinc field tabl plu stool bar tri pretens food leav wallet feel good afterward,good review,4,Spanish

On arrival the restaurant was busy, we were taken to our table and given the menus. Within a couple of minutes we were asked for our order but hadn't even had time to look at all the choices. Bread and a salmon and cream cheese dip were brought to us and it was delicious, I could have eaten more of the dip.  We ordered a bottle of red wine a glass of Rose and water for the table.  For starters I had whitebait and my partner had squid, mine arrived and looked like a bowl of batter bits with a fried egg on top. There was no taste of fish whatsoever and it just felt like a very greasy bowl of food. My partners starter was no better, another bowl of batter, I am not even sure his was squid. As soon as I put my cutlery down, the waiting staff were on one side to remove the plates and on the other side another member of staff had our mains. We felt incredibly rushed. We both ordered the cod with potatoe rosti, these were also disappointing. The rosti was soggy and the cod had no taste to it whatsoever, I had to add salt and pepper to give it any taste. Twice I placed my cutlery down during the meal to chat and on both occasions someone came over to take my plate.  We finished our second course and I checked the time, we had been in the restaurant for 40 minutes. The bottle of wine still had over half left in it.  The waiter came over and asked if we had enjoyed our meal and when we said no, he said sorry and walked away. We didn't complain mainly due to the language barrier but also because we didn't want to attract attention. I was disheartened that when we said no we hadn't enjoyed our meal no one came over to ask us why, it really felt like they didn't care and wanted people in and out as quickly as possible. If we had wanted fried food from a fast food chain then we would have found one, what we wanted was some lovely fish dishes in an authentic restaurant.

The bill came to €26 exactly which felt very reasonable for the quality of food and service we received. The owners are a husband and wife duo. He's Spanish and speaks fluent English. He told us that he learned to cook under Heston Blumental in the UK for four years, then worked in one of the UK's top restaurants for a few more. Very interesting.

At the entrance I was greeted by the host or manager who was not very pleasant asked abruptly if I had a reservation. Although the restaurant was half empty he chose to put us (my son and I)in a corner near the window ...his only argument was that we didn’t have a reservation.  Then came a lady. She was rough and agressive. She handed me the menu without a smile. I chose the bacalao and my son a mixed salad.  I waited nearly half an hour to have my food. The bacalao was very salty and dry. The potato röshti was oily and chewy.  The salad was not tasty and very plain. And the lady server was very unpleasant.   At a certain moment two men wearing shorts and very casually dressed entered the restaurant and asked for a table and although they didn’t have a reservation they gave them a nice table. This is very disrespectful towards us.  I don’t think I ll come back ever to this restaurant.

Talking to our server that day, she told us that the secret to a good paella is the caldo (stock). We had a rough idea of the location when we returned a few weeks ago for lunch, but it looked different. Our server this time told us that they had undergone a renovation a few years ago. We ordered the paella off the menu of the day, and it included a beverage and dessert too.
