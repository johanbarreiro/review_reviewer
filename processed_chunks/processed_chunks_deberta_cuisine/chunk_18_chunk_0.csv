Would have been nice to have been told at the start. Local police have no interest. I never take my phone out with me now unless it’s tied to me! If you visit this place , sit at the back of the restaurant and tie your bag to your leg!

Two days ago, the rest of the family crashed early, so she and I decided to grab some dinner and she found Taberna Mas Al Sur on line. Not far from where we were staying, we decided to take a chance and walked over for dinner. We were blown away! So naturally, two nights later when all five of us were on our last night in Madrid, I suggested that we return. So glad we did, We started off with drinks, as it's a small restaurant and we had to wait for a table. Their bartenders are exceptional. I revisited the Mojito I had a couple days earlier and was delighted that it was just as good. Wife and daughter had tasty sangria and our sons had margaritas which were both delicious and aesthetically pleasing.  After a short wait, we were seated at a cozy table and decided to order everything to share. We stopped short of ordering one of everything, but weren't far off. We had all the usual tapas fare (jamon, croquettes, omelette, quiche) and also had entrees which we all sampled (shrimp in garlic, pork, brochetas de salmon). Nothing on the table was short of amazing. We finished off with cheesecake and carrot cake. At the end of the meal, our 24 year old son exclaimed that this was, by far, the best meal he had ever enjoyed. I'm right there with him. The craziest thing about the evening was that the tab for all five of us, including two drinks each AND a pitcher of sangria, was under 108 Euros for a dinner that left us wanting nothing more. I honestly don't know how these guys do it! If you're in Madrid, do yourself a favor and stop at al Sur for dinner. The only challenge you'll have all night is deciding what to order.",2016-03-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396325-Reviews-or1440-Taberna_Mas_Al_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_16398,0.025,0.876,0.098,0.978,0.2324096880131362,0.5518062397372743,0.3786421052631579,1749,174,0.0994854202401372,2,51,False,59,0.1304347826086956,0.1521739130434782,0.3260869565217391,0.0652173913043478,0.0869565217391304,0.0434782608695652,0.0,0.0217391304347826,0.1521739130434782,0.0217391304347826,330,208,4.3,0,0,famili madrid day visit one daughter studi spain semest two day ago rest famili crash earli decid grab dinner found taberna ma al sur line far stay decid take chanc walk dinner blown away natur two night later five us last night madrid suggest return glad start drink small restaur wait tabl bartend except revisit mojito coupl day earlier delight good wife daughter tasti sangria son margarita delici aesthet pleas short wait seat cozi tabl decid order everyth share stop short order one everyth far usual tapa fare jamon croquett omelett quich also entre sampl shrimp garlic pork brocheta de salmon noth tabl short amaz finish cheesecak carrot cake end meal year old son exclaim far best meal ever enjoy right craziest thing even tab five us includ two drink pitcher sangria euro dinner left us want noth honestli know guy madrid favor stop al sur dinner challeng night decid order,good review,4,Spanish

The food was equally good, and although we are tourists who had not eaten there before, we were treated like VIPs by the Manager Francesco and his terrific staff. When I say “sister restaurant”- there is a literal meaning, as the hostess for InClan Brutal Bar, Helena, is the sister of the hostess for Rosi La Loca, Eva, who had treated us so marvelously last night. Helena is a blonde and Eva is a brunette, but they are equal in warmth and charm - and Helena did a great job of answering all of our menu questions and recommending sumptuous items off of the menu. Our waitress, Julia, was also attentive and very helpful. We ordered amazing tapas appetizers that included burrata infused with pesto and tomato emulsion; hummus with chips and delicious BRUTAL potato wedges with an amazing aoli sauce. Then we moved on to tenderloins of pork, marinated octopus tentacle and the incredible tataki tuna. Everything was just delicious, and the service was amazing.  The wine and sangria were also delicious. The incredible thing about this restaurant, like Rosi La Loca, is that the prices are extremely reasonable and the staff is responsive and extremely helpful. We had a great meal in a welcoming environment.  We would give this restaurant, along with Rosi La Loca, our highest ratings. We would absolutely suggest both as can’t miss favorites for any visit to Madrid, but would suggest you not eat at them in consecutive nights, only because of the similarity of the food. But to be clear, it was similarly delicious! We were glad we got to both before heading home! Thanks to Francesco, Helena and Julia! You made our evening at InClan Brutal Bar memorable!  PS - Be sure to make a reservation - both places were packed and there was a line waiting outside when we left.

The Burrata with pesto injection is just delicious. The tuna tataki is the best fish, I've ever had. Even the typical spanish dishes (as croquetas or tortilla) are just better here. There's always something special with the food. And also the meat (especially the Txuleton) is nice and perfectly medium. And the food itself is always served in a fancy way and every plate is a little piece of art. I also can recommend the ""Menu del día"". And the best thing: it is also not very expensive.

We didn't have reservations, on a Saturday evening at 9pm (pretty silly on our behalf) but the owner almost seemed apologetic that we had to wait to be seated. Within 2 minutes of entering, we had a small soup to warm us and whet our appetite. Drinks ordered, and olives came next. Remember, this is all before we leave bar area. The ambiance is lovely, the staff really attentive and friendly. We ordered some tapas to start, manchego cheese, Chorizo, Jamon and migas, all were wonderful. I specifically want to mention the Chorizo infierno as it was amazing. For main course, we shared Entrecote grilled on charcoal. Possibly one of the best I have had in my 43 years. If a better all round restaurant exists in Madrid, I'd love to know. It's only situated about 100metres from the royal palace. Don't be silly like us, make a booking ( you might be able to get seated in the cellar!) I highly recommend this place.

I am so glad we decided to as we had a perfect evening.  The restaurant is cosy with a great atmosphere and friendly staff. We were sat downstairs in the arches or cellar, not sure what to call it, but I would highly recommend booking a table in this part of the restaurant as it was beautiful.  Our waitress Jazmin was knowledgeable and attentive providing us with great recommendations. They brought us a soup to start our meal which was a nice touch. We went on to order a tapas platter and seafood paella. The tapas of meats and cheese came with bread the most delicious olive oil we have both ever had. We shared a paella which came with mussels and king prawns. The paella was tasty and there was plenty of it. Despite being full we shared some desserts which again were delicious.

Wow. So glad we did. A wonderful experience from ‘greeting ‘til goodbye’ - definitely not a fast-food nor rushed experience. We were warmly greeted by the owner, the son of the founder, who proudly explained the history of the restaurant and what they do. He was passionate about what they did, introduced me to our waiter and then we were taken to a wonderful table downstairs in a lovely warm and cozy room. We were immediately served a boiling hot broth that was made using the local jamon - lovely. Great menu that was brilliantly explained and was packed full of authentic Spanish fayre - from tapas for one or to share, thru to local steaks and vegetables. We had some chorizo and local tomatoes in oil and garlic - simple but so tasty. We then both decided to have the hake with vegetables. Again, simple but packed full of flavour and also freshly hot. We, sadly, had no room for dessert but what we saw looked great. The wine we had, a fabulous Priorat, was great and of brilliant value.  Lovely coffee to finish and then an extremely warm ‘thanks and goodbye’ from the waiter and owner.  Food and service was excellent - please do give this place a go.

Myself, I passed this place while walking to the Sabatini Garden this afternoon and purposely headed back here just before siesta to enjoy authentic Spanish food and beer while sitting at a little table on the street. My waiter, Victor, was attentive but not in a way which made me think he was just trying to turn over a table quickly- he seemed to be truly invested in my experience. I asked what kind of beer they had, to which he responded “solo uno” and I gladly ordered it along with some water and the Anchoas Especiales del Cantábrico (00) 6 Filetes con tomate Especiado con Aceite de Oliva y Piparras (anchovies with spiced tomato, olive oil, & peppers). It was phenomenal! The salt of the fish, the slight heat of the peppers, the tang of the tomatoes, and olive oil blended wonderfully as they crossed my tastebuds, and the beer was crisp and refreshing (not until a Pilsner) without the skunk smell that I find many Spanish beers have. After I’d finished and asked for my check, Victor brought me a complimentary liquor for me to taste, and it was the perfect end to a delightful pre-siesta meal. If you truly appreciate food and culture, this place will not disappoint.",2020-01-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or20-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_16598,0.007,0.84,0.153,0.9913,0.2876666666666667,0.5723333333333334,0.3000142857142857,1383,115,0.0831525668835864,1,33,False,36,0.0526315789473684,0.2105263157894736,0.2982456140350877,0.0175438596491228,0.175438596491228,0.0701754385964912,0.0526315789473684,0.0,0.087719298245614,0.0350877192982456,245,168,4.648979591836735,0,0,honestli got littl angri read american review averag steakhous comment frankli want eat steak travel spain travel spain pass place walk sabatini garden afternoon purpos head back siesta enjoy authent spanish food beer sit littl tabl street waiter victor attent way made think tri turn tabl quickli seem truli invest experi ask kind beer respond solo uno gladli order along water anchoa especial del cant brico filet con tomat especiado con aceit de oliva piparra anchovi spice tomato oliv oil pepper phenomen salt fish slight heat pepper tang tomato oliv oil blend wonder cross tastebud beer crisp refresh pilsner without skunk smell find mani spanish beer finish ask check victor brought complimentari liquor tast perfect end delight pre siesta meal truli appreci food cultur place disappoint,good review,4,Spanish

We were on...","After a week in Spain eating traditional Spanish dishes every single meal, we were pretty much tapa'd out. With all the bread and potatoes that came with every single dish, I was surprised I still fit into the clothes I brought haha. We were on the hunt for something different, but still local.  I came across InClan Brutal and was intrigued by the pictures of the food. It totally reminded me of those trendy restaurants back in Chicago that tried to separate itself from the competition with original concepts and creativity. Spring rolls that look like cigars? Hand torching strips of bacon hanging from a line? Injecting burrata with pesto sauce? They looked unique but still delicious. There was a chance that it was all a gimmick, but InClan was worth a shot.  I luckily snagged a last minute reservation for 2 on The Fork. It was located along a street full of tapas restaurants right off of Puerta del Sol. We still haven't gotten used to the European standards of dinner time so it was completely empty at 6:30 PM, but jam packed by the time we left at 8. Drinks: Their red and white sangrias were great. I usually find traditional sangria to be too sweet and heavy, so I liked that their sangria was more of a blend of different elements. It was sweet enough but still very light and had a refreshing carbonation from the soda. Food: After 2 weeks of eating out, we were trying to control ourselves, but we just couldn't help but order everything off the menu since it all sounded so good.  Burrata injected with pesto - This is one of those dishes that was made for the gram. They brought out a ball of soft and creamy burrata cheese, and then proceeded to inject it with a flavor burst of pesto sauce. Not only did it look pretty, but it tasted great. That soft and creamy cheese mixed perfectly with the garlicky pesto, and it was the perfect spread for the bread they gave. It was one of the more expensive tapas, but totally worth it.  Potato wedges with brutal sauce - I vowed to not each potatoes for the rest of the trip after stuffing ourselves with potatoes five ways at Alhambra the night before, but I just couldn't resist after seeing pictures of the creamy brutal sauce. It was basically a bowl of fried potato wedges just covered in a tasty chipotle mayo sauce. The sauce was creamier and smokier with less tang than your typical bravas sauce. No regrets.  Iberian pork sirloin with cheese sauce, sweet potato chips, and apple compote - After going hard with pretty much 4 appetizers, this was the only entree we ordered. Portion-wise we were happy it wasn't so huge that it put us over the top. This dish had an upscale type of presentation with a rustic wooden platter, perfectly assembled stacks of pork and sweet potato, and then mini dollops of apple compote along the edge. The pork was tender and flavorful and the sweet potato chips were light and crispy. We've become wary of the cheese in Spain because they seemed to love the really strong roquefort/gorgonzola/goat cheeses, which we found it really overwhelming. In this case though, this cheese sauce was very mild and had only a tolerable hint of that strong flavor. Overall it had a nice sweet and savory flavor contrast throughout.  Undercooked potato omelette with black truffle pate - I like egg and potatoes, but every Spanish omelette I've had so far was a little bland and in need of seasoning. I was intrigued by InClan's version because I love runny yolks, and their undercooked version was right up my alley. On top of that, even though you couldn't see it, the black truffle was strong enough to infiltrate every bite. Great truffle flavor without being too overwhelming. Ham croquettes - We originally didn't even order these since we already got the potato wedges, but after hearing a lady at the table next to us describe them as the best croquettes she's ever had, there's no way I could've resisted. She was right. They were filled with mostly bechamel sauce and ham instead of the usual 95% mashed potato filler. Hot and crispy on the outside, creamy and cheesy on the inside...the perfect croquette. Overall, InClan Brutal was fantastic. The food was creative, delicious, and surprisingly filling.

It was very close to my guesthouse, so I went for an early dinner (around 4:30) on a Saturday. Since I was traveling by myself, I felt more comfortable going early. And the restaurants are usually much less crowded. I know that everyone says only the tourists eat early in Madrid, and likely this is true. But even if I had dinner at 11 PM, it's still very obvious that I'm a tourist. :-) I feel that the way a restaurant treats tourists is an indication of how good they are. Some places don't make the effort to elevate your experience because they don't think you will be back. Other restaurants treat everyone with respect and consideration, and I believe that Taberna Mas Al Sur is one. It was uncrowded when I came in and sat at the bar---I love eating at the bar---and I was waited on right away by an efficient, friendly waitress. She explained the menu, and told me about the starred dishes---ones that they especially recommended. You can get a full portion (racione), or half portion, which is great if you want to sample several things. Everything sounded wonderful. Since I don't eat meat, my choices were more limited, but for people who are vegetarians or who eat seafood, there is still plenty of delicious food. I started with a tinto de verano (so good and refreshing), and chose the garlic shrimp and the spinach and cheese quiche. The quiche had a slightly more sweet flavor that I wasn't expecting, and I realized it had raisins! Different, but really good. But the shrimp---I can honestly say it was the best garlic shrimp I've ever eaten! The portion was just right, and the shrimp was so plump and juicy, with lots of buttery, garlicky sauce---perfect for sopping up the the fresh, crusty bread---and I almost hated finishing them. Soooo heavenly. I wish that I'd been able to try some of the other seafood. At the end of the meal, they offer you a complimentary ""shot"", which was actually more than a shot of a nice liqueur similar to Baileys. A lovely ending to a delicious meal, which was also very reasonably priced. And an added bonus---the young waiters dressed in black were all handsome and polite. :-)",2016-05-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396325-Reviews-or1410-Taberna_Mas_Al_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_152,0.017,0.749,0.234,0.9988,0.3238734567901235,0.5938756613756614,0.4147375,2235,197,0.0881431767337807,2,91,False,83,0.1293103448275862,0.1637931034482758,0.293103448275862,0.0948275862068965,0.1379310344827586,0.0344827586206896,0.0172413793103448,0.0258620689655172,0.0517241379310344,0.0517241379310344,396,248,4.646464646464646,0,0,restaur want visit mainli excel tripadvisor review close guesthous went earli dinner around saturday sinc travel felt comfort go earli restaur usual much less crowd know everyon say tourist eat earli madrid like true even dinner pm still obviou tourist feel way restaur treat tourist indic good place make effort elev experi think back restaur treat everyon respect consider believ taberna ma al sur one uncrowd came sat bar love eat bar wait right away effici friendli waitress explain menu told star dish one especi recommend get full portion racion half portion great want sampl sever thing everyth sound wonder sinc eat meat choic limit peopl vegetarian eat seafood still plenti delici food start tinto de verano good refresh chose garlic shrimp spinach chees quich quich slightli sweet flavor expect realiz raisin differ realli good shrimp honestli say best garlic shrimp ever eaten portion right shrimp plump juici lot butteri garlicki sauc perfect sop fresh crusti bread almost hate finish soooo heavenli wish abl tri seafood end meal offer complimentari shot actual shot nice liqueur similar bailey love end delici meal also reason price ad bonu young waiter dress black handsom polit,good review,4,Spanish

I would definitely recommend making a reservation.  Valentina seated us and after a few minutes informed us there was a large group about to be sat all around us and thought we would be more comfortable in a quieter table towards the front. She was so thoughtful to offer and it was a great table!  The hospitality didn't stop there. The table behind us seemed to have some serious food allergies and instead of the waiter getting annoyed, she called over another waiter who basically sat down with them and went through the whole menu explaining what they would be able to eat and what they could leave off a dish. You could see the relief in their faces how nice it was to be taken care of and not feel like a burden because of their situation. It warmed my heart!  Now, on to the food... it was delicious and quite the experience! The basil injected burrata, bacon on a line, and the octopus were the winning dishes of the night!! So fun and seriously delicious!!! I can't recommend this restaurant enough and will definitely come back next time we're in town! Francesco also took great care of us as well, bringing out some of our dishes and putting on quite the show! He also explained their dessert options and helped us make a decision! The customer service here is truly amazing! Probably better than we have ever experienced at any other restaurant around the world!

I'm a big fan of squids but the freshness and flavour of their grilled chipirones is unparalleled. Only regret is that I should have ordered the larger variant of this dish.

All the dishes we ordered were just very delicious! We ordered 5 hot dishes + 3 deserts. The serving was very fast, and it was a team work - backing up each other. The atmosphere was also good, even if it is full of people, it was not noisy. There are also bar places in case all the tables are occupied and you can order small tapas there and they are cooked in front of you. But we came around 19:00 and booked 30 min in advance, so there were some free tables and they actually were open earlier than it is written in the restaurant profile above.

The place was full of Spanish groups of friends laughing and enjoying their wine. The restaurant decor is an interesting mix of modern and vintage and has an earthy indoor outdoor feel.  The menu was very interesting and varied with several twists and different takes on classics such as gazpacho which was served in a martini glass. The food on a whole was delicious and unique with several pleasant surprises when the food arrived. The only slight let down was the cheesecake pudding which proved rubbery and they had ran out of the pudding we had in fact wanted. The drinks here are also delicious and the wine very cheap, dangerously so in fact!

However this place do not serve paella in single portion, so I was paying double price, thinking of eat half and take out the rest half.But it turned out I was very disappointed at their paella that I just left the rest of it without taking them. The seafood on top was actually nice so at least I could eat those, but the rice was so hard to chew on, I notice the rice in paella is usually more chewy, but I believe there's a difference between chewy and not cooked throughly. also the scent of the seafood does not go on the rice, I could only taste the saltiness around them. After they noticed I was unhappy with the dish, they were nice to offer me: 1. to redo the dish again 2. change to another dish 3. Treat me a desert But I don't want to wait another 20 min for them to recook a paella which I'm not sure how it will turn out, and any other dish on the menu was around €6, which does not justify the €30 I'm paying for the paella. They wined up treating me a desert, plus made the sangria I ordered free of charge, which again, very nice of them. But for a tourist that was hoping to have a nice paella during a short stay in Madrid, it is just such a bummer. The sangria and the desert they treated me was actually really nice, and most customers there looks happy. so I would say if you wanna have a drink, some small dishes or desert, maybe give it a try.

I had one of the best meals of my life here last week on Thursday 18th July and then one of the worst meals of my life here last Sunday 21st July. This restaurant/tapas bar was just around the corner from our apartment, and we were delighted to find such a lovely restaurant on our doorstep. The owner seems a lovely man, and we had interesting conversations in a mixture of Spanish and English about the food and Galicia in general. We had a hugely enjoyable meal.  I had the best entrecote I have ever eaten, and my other half had a gorgeous piece of hake in a subtle cinnamon sauce. The postres of chocolate mousse with mint and the tangerine sorbet were also delightful. Buoyed up by this, I changed my plans to cook Sunday dinner and made reservations for the relatively early time of 21:30. This time we were shown into the La Cueva part of the restaurant, which would have been lovely, had they had any food left! No hake, one rather sad entrecote left, cod with peppers without any peppers, no complementary tapa. The vegetables consisted of a small sliver of lettuce, which, frankly, I found insulting. The owner said that the chef had ""let him down"", and that this was the first time it had ever happened, but still did nothing to rectify it or adjust the bill accordingly. It turns out that the Russian ice-skaters had arrived for Cinderella on Ice across the way at Sabatini, and had already taken the lion's share of everything. Nevertheless this was Madrid, it was only 21:30 and we had a reservation. I quote from the owner: "" Oh, you were so happy, and now you are so sad."" Well, yes, exactly. If I hadn't gone back, I would have been praising this place to the heavens. Now, …meh.. take your chances, as it's clearly random.",2013-07-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or940-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_16820,0.037,0.813,0.15,0.9904,0.1060956790123456,0.4665895061728395,0.3604999999999999,1786,165,0.0923852183650615,1,55,False,48,0.1643835616438356,0.1780821917808219,0.273972602739726,0.0684931506849315,0.1643835616438356,0.0136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0273972602739726,0.0410958904109589,0.0547945205479452,326,204,4.478527607361963,0,0,show time everyth one best meal life last week thursday th juli one worst meal life last sunday st juli restaur tapa bar around corner apart delight find love restaur doorstep owner seem love man interest convers mixtur spanish english food galicia gener huge enjoy meal best entrecot ever eaten half gorgeou piec hake subtl cinnamon sauc postr chocol mouss mint tangerin sorbet also delight buoy chang plan cook sunday dinner made reserv rel earli time time shown la cueva part restaur would love food left hake one rather sad entrecot left cod pepper without pepper complementari tapa veget consist small sliver lettuc frankli found insult owner said chef let first time ever happen still noth rectifi adjust bill accordingli turn russian ice skater arriv cinderella ice across way sabatini alreadi taken lion share everyth nevertheless madrid reserv quot owner oh happi sad well ye exactli gone back would prais place heaven meh take chanc clearli random,bad review,2,Spanish

They did not lie or exaggerate!! When we entered we were greeted by a very friendly person behind the bar, they were busy, but told us if we could wait for just a bit they could handle our party of 5. To ease our wait they offered us a glass of wine and a large plate of olives to snack on. The wine and olives were delicious, the atmosphere warm and homey. We decided to stay and wait. We loved it!! Our wait was maybe 20- 30 minutes, but as we didn't have reservations this was more than acceptable, eventually we were lead downstairs to our table where our waiter Angel was just finishing setting the table for us. The room was magnificent with barrel vaulting and old world charm. We ordered more of the house wine and a mixture of appetizers to start. Everything we tried was excellent from the homemade croquettes and escargot, to the tapas and goat cheese salad. For our entree we ordered the mixed paella and 1/4 roasted little goat. Angel kept us supplied in wine and cervasa as the dishes continued to arrive and just as quickly were consumed. Can't really say enough good things about the evening, even after getting back home when we were trying to come up with dinner plans I was thinking I would sure like some more roasted goat.

Looked inviting from the outside and even though we lunched at a very touristy time of 12:30pm the 3 of us all had from start to finish a great experience. First, the coffee was the best we'd had for quite some time. Then the Sangria was some of the best we'd had... then the lunches / tapas were tasty n great. The Bacalou Salad was awesome as was the Chorizo from Hell (although not as hellish as I expected... just very good). As we were there so early (with respect to the local Madrilenos) we only saw a few locals slide in and out for a quite drink and early tapa. We enjoyed sitting out the front in the beautiful day, near a busy section of road but the above food n drink set our moods in the right frame of mind. Looks like it'd be a popular place at the right time, they were just firing up the wood fire grill at the back of the restaurant when we left.

One part of the dinning room is a secret old tunnel that was used by the Royal Palace which is right around the corner.  I was greeted by the head waiter David who was an absolute pleasure to be served by. He was very knowledgable about everything on the menu. The meat selection was amazing and all Spanish as we were showed personally before it was cooked on their in house charcoal grill. I ordered a steak and my girl friend ordered a pork cut called 'presa'. Both meals were outstanding but the pork really stood out. Their wine selection was very nice with a lot of variety. They also had the iconic Jamon Iberico which was seen throughout the bar area. The desserts all looked good but we settled on the cream cheese mouse with berries which was just right after a very good steak. There were no tourists that I noticed so was good to get away from all the tourist traps that were in the area. The prices were very reasonable for the quality we received compared to the other restaurants that we visited in the couple days before on our trip. Can't wait to go back and see what is in store for next time. Make sure you ask for David and you will not be disappointed.

The 1 star is for Santiago, our waiter who was the only saving grace for our meal. Had reserved a table in advance and it took a while for anyone to notice us waiting to be seated - were then shoved to the back of the restaurant in a corner (I think this is where they put all the non-Spanish speaking ""tourists""). Waited over 20 minutes for a drinks order to be taken. It was almost an hour before food was served. Ordered 5 plates of tapas to share between two. Two of the first three dishes were stone cold - for this reason the risotto was inedible but I ate my half as I was starving. We told Santiago this and he assured us the next two plates would be served at the proper temperature - which they were. Don't bother ordering the ""bacon on a clothesline"". If sharing, you get 1 slice of bacon blow-torched at your table. It is very much a case of style over substance. The tuna however, was very tasty. By this point, we just wanted to pay and go. But means of trying to compensate us, we were given a complimentary Green Tea Panna Cotta. When my sister said she hated Green Tea we were then given 4 complimentary test tubes of a drink a-kin to Baileys. Not sure what pillows stuck to the wall with black and white film reels projected over them does for the ambiance of the restaurant. I really hate leaving bad reviews, but apart from Santiago who, bless him, was rushed off his feet tending to at least 2 tables of 15 plus others I have no other positive things to say. Avoid unless you want a 'weird and bad' under-staffed experience (in the words of my sister).",2017-11-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10358028-Reviews-or820-Inclan_Brutal_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_16874,0.121,0.81,0.069,-0.9694,-0.147168911335578,0.4861485222596333,0.3837277777777778,1717,158,0.0920209668025626,0,47,False,55,0.0985915492957746,0.1126760563380281,0.1971830985915492,0.028169014084507,0.1126760563380281,0.0845070422535211,0.056338028169014,0.0704225352112676,0.1549295774647887,0.0845070422535211,325,220,4.286153846153846,1,0,high expect restaur see rate restaur madrid could disappoint star santiago waiter save grace meal reserv tabl advanc took anyon notic us wait seat shove back restaur corner think put non spanish speak tourist wait minut drink order taken almost hour food serv order plate tapa share two two first three dish stone cold reason risotto ined ate half starv told santiago assur us next two plate would serv proper temperatur bother order bacon clotheslin share get slice bacon blow torch tabl much case style substanc tuna howev tasti point want pay go mean tri compens us given complimentari green tea panna cotta sister said hate green tea given complimentari test tube drink kin bailey sure pillow stuck wall black white film reel project ambianc restaur realli hate leav bad review apart santiago bless rush feet tend least tabl plu other posit thing say avoid unless want weird bad staf experi word sister,bad review,2,Spanish

We were heading for a couple of other tapas places near the Palacio Royal and I just liked the look of La Mi Venta as we walked by. The evening was warm enough to sit outside for dinner but the inside was cosy and appealing as well. There are two beautiful dining rooms downstairs which would be great for a private group, one is in an ancient cellar space with stone walls. Very nice. David was the main server the night we stopped in. His warm welcome and fluent English made us feel very welcome. We tried three tapas, including migas--- a dish I had on my list to try but have shied away from in places where it often is an oily overly garlicy mass of bread cubes. La Mi Venta's version was delicious. Excellent hams and charcuterie, the pisto (warm, oil poached vegetables sort of like a Spanish Ratatouille) were all very, very good and high quality. Glasses of excellent Riojas were generous and fairly priced. We also ordered a large green salad to round out our 'light' dinner and it was a beautiful plate of uber-fresh greens dressed with delicious olive oil. Talking with David about their meats, including the Galician 'buey' steaks, we decided to return the next evening to order those. Good choice. Prices were very fair, I thought, for the quality of the tapas and the main dishes. This is definitely on my list to go back to when I am in Madrid again.

This quickly changed as the very helpful and friendly staff helped us pick out an exquisite dinner consisting of dishes small and large, pleasing both to our eyes and our palates. The different tapas we tried were great, as was the paella. We enjoyed both local dishes such as their ham croquettes and grilled octopus tentacle, as well as Asian influenced dishes like the tuna tataki. Their ""Super Tapa"" sizes were perfect for sharing among a small group of friends. The only thing bland were the desserts, which were decent, but not great.

He gave us food recommendations from things he enjoy from the menu, and when we asked him about where were fun places to visit, and where to find parties and just do anything to make our visit fun and exciting he gave us a list of things. He also even went as far to give us a free round of shots to celebrate our friends birthday. He was very attentive to our table and every request we had he fulfilled.

It was good as at least we knew we can order quick and leave eralier. It appears there is a space with tables upstairs to have tapas or pinchos and a drink but also proper restaurant downstairs with white tablecloths etc.  We have picked recommended house wine for only 14 euros which was very nice. We have been serviced with ham soup, lovely huge slice of bread and olive oil (all not ordered, just extras) . Apparently soup was very salty ( I didnt try as I do not eat meat). We have ordered ham croquetts, toast with tuna belley and carmelised tomatoes and deep fried cheese stick for a starters. All very nice. Then my husband had some beef steak and I had cod deep fried in batter. Both meals were accompnied by same sides (potatoes with fried onions and pepers plus padron peppers. I dont think there was any choice. Beef was apparently nice but my cod was huge hence undercooked inside. I had only eaten cooked bits and left most of it, I didnt want to make a scene and ruin atmosphere. Sides were lovely though. We have decided not to go for desserts but rather head to San Miguel Market for some sweet snacks.  Prices were different then on the website but still affordable I would say. Portions of food were good but was not that keen on service. It took a while to clear our plates after main meal and get attention to ask for a bill - even if there were only 5 tables in the room. I am not sure it is because our original waiter was busy in other room or the second one that suppose take over was too bussy fussing around the guy who has ordered quite expensive bottle of wine and did not pay much attention to others? We have paid 75 euros in total which wasnt too bad and food was lovely.",2014-02-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or920-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_16891,0.032,0.826,0.142,0.9933,0.1673684210526315,0.5769005847953217,0.42105,1848,169,0.0914502164502164,0,32,False,72,0.12,0.16,0.2666666666666666,0.1066666666666666,0.1333333333333333,0.0266666666666666,0.0133333333333333,0.04,0.0533333333333333,0.08,352,223,4.247159090909091,0,0,hae book valentin husband birthday arriv pm coupl apart peopl bar good least knew order quick leav erali appear space tabl upstair tapa pincho drink also proper restaur downstair white tablecloth etc pick recommend hous wine euro nice servic ham soup love huge slice bread oliv oil order extra appar soup salti didnt tri eat meat order ham croquett toast tuna belley carmelis tomato deep fri chees stick starter nice husband beef steak cod deep fri batter meal accompni side potato fri onion peper plu padron pepper dont think choic beef appar nice cod huge henc undercook insid eaten cook bit left didnt want make scene ruin atmospher side love though decid go dessert rather head san miguel market sweet snack price differ websit still afford would say portion food good keen servic took clear plate main meal get attent ask bill even tabl room sure origin waiter busi room second one suppos take bussi fuss around guy order quit expens bottl wine pay much attent other paid euro total wasnt bad food love,good review,4,Spanish

As we walked in the place was quite empty, but already from the outside we got a good feeling: the place did not look like a tourist trap and inside the bar was an authentic Spanish place. Tapas starters were truly delicious and big portions as well. After sharing 2 tapas platters we only had room for salads, and these were outstanding (we had one goat cheese and one smoked cod salad) ! Wine from the house was perfect (a Crianza at 14,90 euro) and service friendly and attentive. A great surprise and a place to recommend, I will be back when in Madrid again, it is also very central even if a bit tucked away (which makes the whole experience nice and cozy).",2014-02-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or920-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_16892,0.036,0.683,0.281,0.9945,0.36,0.6125,0.4135399999999999,815,70,0.0858895705521472,1,18,False,44,0.0975609756097561,0.2195121951219512,0.2682926829268293,0.073170731707317,0.1707317073170731,0.024390243902439,0.024390243902439,0.048780487804878,0.048780487804878,0.024390243902439,154,117,4.298701298701299,0,0,decid go la mi venta colleagu mine check review tripadvisor pleas say realli great experi walk place quit empti alreadi outsid got good feel place look like tourist trap insid bar authent spanish place tapa starter truli delici big portion well share tapa platter room salad outstand one goat chees one smoke cod salad wine hous perfect crianza euro servic friendli attent great surpris place recommend back madrid also central even bit tuck away make whole experi nice cozi,very good review,5,Spanish

We liked the fusions and the mini cocktails were great! We decided to take a large group there a couple of months later and did not have the same experience. The food was average and the service was not great. The waiter I believe his name was Cristian, thought it would be funny to mock our accents, which is funny for 2 minutes, but he did this throughout the entire evening. Not only this he advised us that they didn't do 'tap' water so we had to buy 500ml water bottles (for 8 people). I then realized he was giving other tables (from which I could hear were Spanish customers) large glass bottles of tap water. I am an avid 'non' plastic user where possible so I was extremely annoyed and of course, bottled water costs a lot more. I did send the bottled water we hadn't opened back and asked for bottled water in the end, but I can't blame miscommunication as I am bilingual and I felt like we were being pushed for our money because the majority of the group were 'dumb tourists'.

A few colleagues and I stopped by Mas al Sur based on recommendations from Trip advisor to kick off our first night in Madrid.  We had Lucas as our server and he was friendly, genuine, attentive and made good recommendations. We requested a table outside and was seated within 5 minutes. Between the 3 of us we sampled about 1/4 of the dinner menu. The prawns were so tasty, we ordered 2 large orders. The octopus was tender and savory. We also had the salmon which was good but not the star of the menu; salad with goat cheese; wook noodles and mushrooms were flavorful. The Cuban shredded pork was deliciously silky smooth and the cod was cooked and seasoned just right were the two star dishes for this restaurant. We had a local beer and the sangria was great. We finished the night with a fruit pie that was just excellent! We were completely full by the end of the night and the total cost was very reasonable which highlights the value of this restaurant.

Very understate exterior, and not situated in the best part of town but once inside it is warm and friendly. Don't get caught out by the sliding door at the entrance (I think it has to be opened by staff), it's a little off putting.

The sharing portions are generous and very well presented. Food quality was excellent and prices are very reasonable.  While the dining area is small they can pack a good number of customer in when needed. So be prepared to meet your neighbours!

We shared steak, meatballs, and some grilled banana, salsa and avocado creation.  Not being one for avocado, I cannot personally endorse it, but the ladies loved it. The meatballs I thought were pretty good but the other guy with us wasn’t wild about it. The steak was excellent for the area, and almost as good as a sirloin in an excellent North American steak house. The fried potato cubes were also great. The sangria we collectively rated as the second best we have had so far (and we have had a few).  The server was friendly, helpful, attentive and had a great sense of humour The entire meal for four with Sangria and a beer was less than 50 Euro.  The only detractors were that some of the seats were a little uncomfortable, and since the place was small and seemed to have a regular Saturday night crowd of locals, it was a little noisy.

It was hot and we were looking for a somewhere peaceful, away from the many touristy places near the Plaza Mayor. El Rincon del Cabo caught my eye in the list of nearby restaurants. After a brief walk into the less crowded back streets, we found it and did a double take. It was not at all attractive from the outside. It was very small and empty (although it was still early for lunch by Spanish standards), and the décor was quirky. Without TripAdvisor we would not have ventured inside but we are glad we did. The gentleman who served us, presumably one of the owners, was very welcoming and helpful. We had local beer, a potato and onion omelet, and three open faced sandwiches.

Every time I come to Madrid with international or national friends I take them There.its a mandatory stop in Madrid If you appreciate good food and art.  The flamenco show is overwhelmingly passionate and the music is fantastic. It’s pure noisy, loud flamenco being danced and sang just a few metres in front of you.  The food is very nice, classic Spanish food. Pricey but incredibly high quality and well cooked. The waiters are super nice and all speak English. Oscar our waiter was hyper nice. The room is as it was 60 years ago, full of history charm and stories so don’t expect a big theatre style place. It’s a lovely and charming environment where you probably are seated on the exact same vintage wooden chair as Marlon Brando or Marlene Dietrich were one day.  Some advice , if you want to try the food but you want to be able to chat with your group, book the separate dinner in the other room and then you will be moved to the flamenco show.  If you don’t mind or have short time you can also chose to do dinner during the show. It’s a bit more uncomfortable since you are eating in the dark and you can’t really talk. Anyway the dancers and musicians will leave you speechless so you will not want to be chatting during the show .  Ive also opted for going just for a drink and the show when my friends preferred a more relaxed tapas style dinner.  In summary: don’t miss it !!",2018-09-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or50-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17069,0.039,0.783,0.178,0.9929,0.2270178571428571,0.4932777777777778,0.4575,1436,122,0.0849582172701949,2,24,False,51,0.1029411764705882,0.1323529411764706,0.3088235294117647,0.0735294117647058,0.25,0.0147058823529411,0.0,0.0,0.0441176470588235,0.0735294117647058,268,173,4.33955223880597,0,0,ive flamenco tablao time everi time come madrid intern nation friend take mandatori stop madrid appreci good food art flamenco show overwhelmingli passion music fantast pure noisi loud flamenco danc sang metr front food nice classic spanish food pricey incred high qualiti well cook waiter super nice speak english oscar waiter hyper nice room year ago full histori charm stori expect big theatr style place love charm environ probabl seat exact vintag wooden chair marlon brando marlen dietrich one day advic want tri food want abl chat group book separ dinner room move flamenco show mind short time also chose dinner show bit uncomfort sinc eat dark realli talk anyway dancer musician leav speechless want chat show ive also opt go drink show friend prefer relax tapa style dinner summari miss,good review,4,Spanish

Desert and after dinner drinks were served during breaks. The food was good. There are 4 menus to choose from. They range from 72 euros to 130 euros with a show, depending on what food you order. The show was incredible. They have their own guitar players and singers. First there are 4 dancers in a show. Then there are the featured dancers. I don't know how to describe it except to say it was mesmerizing. It seemed only a short time before the 2 hours was up.

In the Corral this traditional concept is taken to new heights: the food is of the highest standard and so are the flamenco artists. You can dine from the menu or choose from different menus, ranging from 40 to 80 Euro's. Wine arrangements are also available at decent prices. If you only want to have dinner without the show - the restaurant has one Michelin star - there is a separate small room available with just a few tables. Service is friendly, attentive and pleasantly informal. We chose a four course meal and were really impressed by the quality of the food - the best we've had so far in Madrid. Until this evening we were a little bit disappointed about our 5-day city trip to Madrid, but this evening alone was worth the entire journey. It is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Yes, it will cost you a fair amount of money (including tips, tickets, dinner and excellent wines, we paid about € 300 for two persons). Yes, the tables are too close together. Yes, there is this slight feeling of ""being processed"" because the second show will start shortly after. Yes, it is a pity that you probably will not have finished your dinner when the show starts, so service goes on. But if you set all that aside, you will have one of the best evenings in your life. 1 of 1,000 things to see before you die?

To say it was poor is an understatement. I opted for the four course meal + wine & show to make the night as special as possible. I should have known we were in for a rough night when they sat us in front of a pole to watch the show, so we had an obscured view. For $300 you would expect a better seat. The next disappointment was that the meal was prefixe with no flexibility. This was not advertised in advance and I am not a fish fan, so half the meals I did not eat. Next came the rack of lamb which was very small and gave me four satisfying bites of a meal. I eagerly awaited dessert as I was hoping for redemption and the waiter never even bothered to show up again, which I think had something to do with us preparing in advance. If you’re keeping score I had some rack of lamb and that’s it. Not bad for $300 right?  The one saving grace was that the show and performers were spectacular. If you have the option to see them with as little frills as possible go for it as you will not be disappointed.

Now I don’t mind paying for a great experience but I mind if I see a couple arriving after us and giving them a big table having only 2 x cheap NOT EVEN AN APPETISER!!! We were sat me facing the bar and my girlfriend facing the show!!!  It’s ok if the food was basic tapas...but it wasn’t!! Basically what I am trying to say... Food and show was amazing But whoever organised the seating plan needs to properly change job!! Also when waiting staff come to explain dishes the only thing I could feel was the breath stunk of CIGARETTES ... I hate smoking and to me this is a big disrespect to the chef who did a great job!!! You are wasted there chef... That type of food deserves a nice table ( space ) and for the show I would serve only basic sharing tapas as show was fantastic too!!

I had great service from start to finish. As I went on my own the table I was seated at felt a bit awkward to me as I was in the middle of an archway facing a wall but I had a great view of the show and I was well tended to by the staff. One small issue I had was resolved immediately, I had no candle at my table as everyone else did and you eat during the show with the lights mostly off. But this is not a complaint , as soon as I asked for some light they were very apologetic and brought me a candle immediately. My water and wine were consistently being topped up. I ordered the salmon which is cooked at a low temperature and it was absolutely delicious. They also brought me a lovely desert on the house. The host at the door, Juanma, was very kind and helpful as it was my first night in Madrid and I was looking to find somewhere to go and he gave many helpful suggestions. I really had a lovely time.

We ordered full cheese platter and we were served half platter which was also a tiny portion. Waitress first said it is full portion but then she confirmed with kitchen and it was half.  All food portions in general are small and without any flavour. Charging €1.90 for just one small croquette is ridiculous and more so when it is without any flavour.  We asked for a bread desert that comes with cinnamon ice cream as per menu card. Instead it was served with just a tablespoon of Vanilla ice cream and waitress said since icecream was finishing they had to divide equally between 5 portions. Excuse me!!! The only good thing: The manager she apologized for the errors. I know they have just started in Madrid, but I would rather not open to public if the place is not prepared.

We were very specific that we didn't want to dine at a ""tourist trap"" and wanted to experience really good Spanish tapas. He was very honest and said that you will see other visitors dining there, but it is by no means a tourist restaurant. He was 100% right, and we absolutely loved our meal!  Atmosphere: The first thing that struck me, even before sampling the food or famous sangria, was the cool branding. Their signature red and white polka dots (or variations of them) were prominently yet tastefully displayed throughout the restaurant. I particularly loved the wall of bottles (an art installation) and the use of a different color bottle to represent each type of sangria.  Food: You'll find a combination of classic tapas with a twist along with some unique dishes that I didn't see elsewhere. Everything we ordered was tasty but here are some of our favorites:  1) Risotto with truffle oil  2) Croquetas de jamon (though they offered a fun option to try 4 different kinds, which we did)  3) Roast Beef with onion on toast point  4) Sangria #1 - Red  We enjoyed our meal and the service so much the first night, that we went back on our final evening in Madrid (before flying home to the states).  Overall: Definitely check out this restaurant if you want a lovely and fun dining experience. Make a reservation though, especially on weekends as it gets busy.",2019-11-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d17413088-Reviews-or20-Casa_Lolea_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_17123,0.027,0.82,0.153,0.992,0.2346056547619047,0.470517113095238,0.5064,1501,117,0.0779480346435709,1,43,False,66,0.12,0.18,0.36,0.08,0.12,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.0,0.06,265,184,4.637735849056604,1,0,recent visit madrid sister dine restaur recommend one employe hotel specif want dine tourist trap want experi realli good spanish tapa honest said see visitor dine mean tourist restaur right absolut love meal atmospher first thing struck even sampl food famou sangria cool brand signatur red white polka dot variat promin yet tast display throughout restaur particularli love wall bottl art instal use differ color bottl repres type sangria food find combin classic tapa twist along uniqu dish see elsewher everyth order tasti favorit risotto truffl oil croqueta de jamon though offer fun option tri differ kind roast beef onion toast point sangria red enjoy meal servic much first night went back final even madrid fli home state overal definit check restaur want love fun dine experi make reserv though especi weekend get busi,good review,4,Spanish

The tapas was just beyond a typical traditional, yet keeping them in the mind. Vegetarian and sea food dishes were excellent. We had a range of everything, but few great to mention: mushroom croquettes were just fantastic and way better than we had in some other places, all tuna dishes were fresh and delicious, and one example of creativity was a gazpacho with watermelon, could drink that every morning. And not to forget the truffle risotto (no rise, but pasta). And on top of everything the staff was friendly, helpful, efficient and English speaking. The location is also great, just few blocks from Gran Via and in the middle of the vibrant nightlife. Go there and enjoy!

All this is true, of course, the Flamenco is really amazing here. The only problem is that unless you have a front-line seat, you won't be unable to see most of the show. We went there with a dinner + show reservation and were given a seat at the back of the place. The place was crammed, and having do many people in front of me could have been a problem by itself. But the awful thing is that they just keep serving dinners during the show, so all I sould see for a very long time were the waiters' heads and ands carrying full and empty dishes around. They really shouldn't allow dinners to go on during the show. I tried to stand and lean against the wall but then I was of hinder to the waiters' jobs.

Dinner = Horrible! The show should not be missed. The dinner should be avoided. Watch the show with a drink, skip the dinner.  The show was fantastic. The performers were exceptionally talented and truly put great effort and emotion into the experience.  The dinner was horrible and over priced. The venue is extremely crowded with the tables next to each other. Food orders are taken just before the show. Despite being told that we would eat before the performance, as soon as the lights go off the the performance begins and the meals are served. Thus you must eat in darkness while trying to watch the show. I had to use the light on my cell phone to try to see the food. As for the food, it was served cold, undercooked and uneatable. Since it was dark, the servers could not be attentive. Dinning was expensive, and extremely unpleasant.
