It was beautiful and had a real nice traditional Spanish feel about it. As it was our first night we wanted tapas, paella and Sangria and that was what we got! We had ham croquettes and calamari to start which was simply out of this world and probably the best in Madrid! But it didn't stop there, we ordered the paella as a main which had a minimum waiting time of 40 minutes but we didn't care. About 20 minutes waiting it arrived and the waiter dished it up at the table for us. The waiters couldn't do enough for you it was definitely first class service from them. Our meal was superb and the price is reasonable. Our waiter brought out ""Grappa!?"" which tasted like Baileys and we loved it so much he brought out more!

I went past this place the first night and ended up going back in for a quick night cap before turning in the second night.  Both nights the place was busy, a slick operation where people hang at the bar and then move to tables as they become ready. Smart and attentive wait staff capably handle this bustle in a friendly and efficient manner.  Both nights I sampled the red wine, a Rioja tempranillo and ate, the first night the paella de mariscos and the pulpo. You can get cheaper eats in Madrid, you can also probably get food where the flavours are a bit more bold and/or nuanced but for a cool bar with semi-ambitious eats, this place cannot be faulted.

Knowing we were Americans he explained the dishes in a way that made it easily understandable. He made great suggestions to include the wine.

When the food arrived (very efficiently and quickly) it was amazing. The corn fed loin, the croquettes, the Iberian ham and the tapas of pinchos were absolutely delicious.

Sweets of chocolate mousse with pistachio ice cream rounded the meal off beautifully. Decent wine selection at decent prices - our whole meal including wine and sparkling water came to about 90 euros.

We had lunch one day sitting outside & shared the tabla de pinchos. A nice glass of vina rosado washed the delicious pinchos down beautifully. But our eyes were caught by the food being brought to the table next to us. So after a quick chat with the friendly waiter, we decided to book a table for the following evening with a pre-order made for the roast baby goat. This was our first time down in the cellar restaurant, always having eaten outside before, and it was a lovely atmosphere. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, and we had a wonderful evening. The foie with apple & caramelised onion to start with was very good, and the roast kid (la cabrita) was worth having pre-ordered it. The meat was falling off the bones, sweet & with lots of jus in the pan to keep it moist. Served wth yummy padron peppers.  They also have a good, reasonably priced wine list, and we thoroughly enjoyed the Ribero del Duero that we ordered.

We stopped in without reservations (bad plan), but the wonderfully friendly and considerate maitre'd found a table for us anyway, and the place was packed. The food was beyond exceptional. I had the tapas meat and cheese variety - exquisitely prepared - chorizo made the right way, not the greasy mess that is the Mexican-American standard. The cured beef was incredible - think bacon made from cows, not pigs. My wife raved about her salad. Our waiter was excellent in all regards - unquestionably busy, but cool and professional without a hint of being rushed. When we passed on dessert, he brought us samples of a Spanish version of Irish Crème liqueur on the house. A tremendous dinner in every respect.

Due to my inability to remember the name of the dishes I can't say what specifically I had, but most of their popular stuff is indicated with a star. The restaurant is a little out of the way but definitely worth finding. Super tasty meals for an incredibly, reasonable price. The two shining moments, the moments that out-shined the food itself, were the people that worked there. The people that were getting us our food and drinks were Johnny, Carla, and Edgar. What amazing people. When Johnny was leaving for the night he went up to his customers and shook their hands and said how he really appreciated them coming out. I myself personally appreciated the kind gesture. Later after we were done they called a cab for the group of people I was with. Such phenomenal service and incredible food.

The guitarist, vocalists and dancer showed amazing energy and passion. Through several costume changes the mood of the dancers and singers changed, using fans, castanets, and an abundant range of stage vibrating footwork. Our only disappointment was the lack of an English explanation at any point in the performance.

We were visiting Plaza Mayor and wandered across a bar with a lady outside enquiring if people wanted to attend flamenco that evening. She showed us inside and the place looked lovely.

Their passion for what they were performing was very apparent and I was totally absorbed by the performance throughout.

And then after one show, we realized ""Wow, this is amazing!"" and when the opportunity presented itself to go to another one before we left, we also thought why not? So this one was our second show in three nights and we loved it.  As I started writing this I thought to myself that this was my favorite but remembering the other one as well has me realizing they were both great for their own reasons.

Each dish was as exceptionally good as the previous and their sangria is the best we've had in Spain. There are still menu items we'd like to try and we might show up for a third visit during our 5 day stay in Madrid. In addition to being more than satisfied with our meals and drinks, our server surprised us with little chupita to end our meal on our first visit and a piece of cheesecake (to die for) on our second visit.

When we got there it seemed like a small restaurant with a stage and I was not sure what it was going to be like. You can either book tickets just for the show or book tickets with one drink for the show or dinner with the show. When the Taberna filled up and the guitarist came out and started to play I began to relax as he was very good and got everyone in the mood for the show. The singers came on next and they were very good and sang from the heart (very emotional). The male and female dancers came on next and they were excellent. They were skillful, passionate and very quick footed. The show lasted 2 hours and a highlight was when the Madrid Good Friday parade went by the Taberna it stopped outside and our male singer was asked to go out and sing to the madonna statue. The crowd was huge and the atmosphere intense and his emotional singing very moving. We then went back inside for the rest of the show, part of which involved members of the audience being invited onto the stage to get a lesson in Flamenco. My wife enjoyed this and she was difficult to remove from the stage. We had a meal with the show. The food is pretty basic but ok. Not the place to go if you are expecting top class food fare.

Upon arrival we were taken to our seats at the back corner of the stage. Seems like people who reserved table for show + meal (60 €) were placed at the front of the stage. We saw the back of the performers most of the show, yet I must say they are super professional (singers and dancers) so we still enjoyed the show very much - it was absolutely beautiful!! The only reason i am not rating this five stars is because of the seating issue. Reserving seats a day ahead and being crammed in the back while paying full price - I didn't appreciate it. So my only suggestion will be to make sure where your seats are located prior to the show. Also, not to be petty, but I am pregnant so didn't drink any alcohol ,yet the waitress charged us for the second glass of wine my husband ordered instead of adding my soda on the bill (which obviously cost much less).",2017-11-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3847118-Reviews-or150-La_Taberna_de_Mister_Pinkleton-Madrid.html,UID_15124,0.02,0.914,0.066,0.7769,0.2061111111111111,0.4295679012345678,0.4751571428571428,931,86,0.0923737916219119,2,25,False,33,0.0869565217391304,0.0869565217391304,0.2608695652173913,0.0434782608695652,0.2608695652173913,0.0434782608695652,0.0,0.0869565217391304,0.0869565217391304,0.0434782608695652,182,123,4.12087912087912,0,0,reserv seat day advanc show drink upon arriv taken seat back corner stage seem like peopl reserv tabl show meal place front stage saw back perform show yet must say super profession singer dancer still enjoy show much absolut beauti reason rate five star seat issu reserv seat day ahead cram back pay full price appreci suggest make sure seat locat prior show also petti pregnant drink alcohol yet waitress charg us second glass wine husband order instead ad soda bill obvious cost much less,bad review,2,French

We had our show time at 21-00. The next show was at 23-00. I thought first it would be a cheap attraction for tourists like it always happens in touristic city centers, but I was surprised to find it different. The place is not big and the tables are very small, but it gave an atmosphere of cosiness and I liked it. Friendly stuff and waiters are cool! Flamenco dancers are amazingly hot and passionate. The singer was also amazing with his voice, but so sad I do not understand Spanish, because there was a story in his words. First time I had to regret I don't speak Spanish :) And you can go on stage and try to dance flamenco yourself under the guidance of the dancer. My friend did. Was fun fun fun! Food was also very very good: you can chose something like 3 dishes per person + drinks and desert (more you don't need) and it all was included in the price we paid.

There are a number of Tabernas, each with their charm in Madrid. Here is where there is a difference though. Mister Pinkleton offers an authentic experience. The size is just right. Not too big, actually a cozy feel in the place, and every table offers a good view and proximity to the stage. Then you have the performers. The Flamenco troupe that performed did so with their hearts and such passion. The fun continues when they invite audience members to come dance with them onstage and clap and stomp Flamenco style. I did. You feel like with you are with family members and that helps make it a great experience. The show is a full 90 plus minutes with an encore. The basic cover charge of 30 euros per person is a good value and includes a glass of wine and in Spain there is no such thing as bad wine. The house red wine ( a ribera del duero red) is good. A nice menu is offered that you can order snacks or if hungry order a full meal. The three show times 7,9, and 11 pm make it easy to pick a convenient time. Reservations recommended for the 7,9 time slots. Guarantee your table with a 20 euro deposit. The location couldn't be easier to get to in Plaza San Miguel and close to several Metro stops. If you are in the mood or have worked up an appetite, there are a number of restaurants all along the way including the famous Casa Botin, Finally, the staff is friendly, speak several languages, and make it easy to get in and out.

We struggled with Spanish and they with English, but we were able to communicate well. Food portions were large and arrived extraordinarily quickly. Our salad and seafood paella was great: flavorful, great texture and the seafood was well prepared. Two of us shared one salad, one paella and a desert - and that provided plenty of food for one hearty and one modest appetite. The waiter, Peter, was fun and patient with a group of foreigners who didn't speak the language. He brought us some extras he thought we might enjoy.

A search on restaurants near us turned up this lovely restaurant with great reviews across a number of platforms. Our hotel front desk kindly called for us and secured us a table with a hour's notice. It was only when we arrived and saw how few tables the restaurant has that we realised how lucky we were to get a spot. A couple of the (very few) less favourable reviews have noted the small size of the space here. As someone who particularly hates feeling crowded I can reassure you that the restaurant may be small but it is perfectly formed, and there really are no space issues. Yes, you have to be aware of other diners and staff moving around the restaurant, but no more so than anywhere else I have eaten. They have made great use of the space they have.  The food was excellent - for starters we had bruschetta and burrata tricolore, and this was followed by a caesar salad and diavola pizza to share. We enjoyed every bite and couldn't fault anything - it was all flavourful and perfectly seasoned. We eat a lot of Italian food, both at home in the UK and on trips away, and the food here was way above average. The portions were generous and the prices extremely reasonable, which is even better.  As soon as you walk in, the restaurant feels inviting and very relaxed - the team have got the balance just right. The service was really attentive throughout, without being overbearing in any way.  We ate here on our last night in Madrid but I know if we had been here a few nights longer we would certainly have wanted to make a return visit. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant, but definitely make a reservation to avoid disappointment.",2018-12-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10167023-Reviews-or10-Jack_Percoca-Madrid.html,UID_20873,0.045,0.759,0.195,0.9957,0.1720098039215686,0.4724159663865546,0.5219333333333334,1827,164,0.0897646414887794,0,37,False,72,0.0579710144927536,0.144927536231884,0.2753623188405797,0.072463768115942,0.1884057971014492,0.0289855072463768,0.0289855072463768,0.0289855072463768,0.1159420289855072,0.0579710144927536,332,209,4.496987951807229,0,0,look somewher eat saturday night weekend decid find somewher onlin rather chanc tri get walk tabl search restaur near us turn love restaur great review across number platform hotel front desk kindli call us secur us tabl hour notic arriv saw tabl restaur realis lucki get spot coupl less favour review note small size space someon particularli hate feel crowd reassur restaur may small perfectli form realli space issu ye awar diner staff move around restaur anywher els eaten made great use space food excel starter bruschetta burrata tricolor follow caesar salad diavola pizza share enjoy everi bite fault anyth flavour perfectli season eat lot italian food home uk trip away food way averag portion gener price extrem reason even better soon walk restaur feel invit relax team got balanc right servic realli attent throughout without overbear way ate last night madrid know night longer would certainli want make return visit hesit recommend restaur definit make reserv avoid disappoint,good review,4,Italian

We arrived very early, so we didn't have to wait to get served.The waitress was friendly and passionate. She told us we could ask for half portions and share them. But she offered us olives and chupitos and it wasn't clear if we were supposed to pay for them or not, so we rejected them. Only when we ordered the bill, we had to wait a looooong time. If you're looking for real Spanish tapas, raciones, tablas and desserts, this is NOT the place to go.",2015-07-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2440-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_20958,0.034,0.849,0.117,0.9573,0.1214351851851852,0.3887037037037038,0.2481181818181818,1017,108,0.1061946902654867,2,35,False,42,0.25,0.1666666666666666,0.2222222222222222,0.0555555555555555,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833333333333333,0.0,192,128,4.302083333333333,0,0,friend kazakhstan decid go taberna el sur close rate high first look fine discov storag area bench well big place menu short food spanish also intern dish expect spanish dessert howev good even though banana cake carrot cake tast banana carrot mainli spice arriv earli wait get serv waitress friendli passion told us could ask half portion share offer us oliv chupito clear suppos pay reject order bill wait looooong time look real spanish tapa racion tabla dessert place go,bad review,2,Spanish

El Sur is about a 10 minute walk at most from the central plaza at Sol. It's definitely worth the trip to get away from the crowds.  The taberna/restaurant is small but inviting. The staff are incredibly friendly, most speaking English and Spanish. We were seated quickly while enjoying excellent wines from the bar area. Food was spectacular; everything recommended was perfect. We enjoyed the Mediterranean salad, a pork dish called ""filet mignon"" *not beef in Spain* and a beef dish called ropa something. Sangria was excellent and cheap. Overall, this place really met all our criteria: excellent, affordable, authentic cuisine. Not droves of tourists, a hole in the wall.

Unfortunately, we had a long wait to be seated and a long wait to be served. After wrapping up our full visit in Spain, slow service seems to be a trend.

While waiting for a table, a kind gentleman started chatting with us. He offered us advice on traveling through Spain and picking food/drinks at the restaurant and was generally very friendly - indicative of the types of people that frequent this restaurant. When we sat at the table, our waiter, Alex, was very accommodating with our language deficiencies, offering us menus in English. He introduced himself and chatted to us for a bit - the friendliest waiter we've ever had, who made us feel incredibly welcome at Taberna el Sur. Alex informed us that we coild order half portions so the raciones would be tapas, so we could try as much as we wanted. We ordered the Muzaka, Ropa de Viejas, curry chicken, bacalau, filet mignon (at the recommendation of the friendly bartender who we asked while we waited for a table), two mojitos, and a coffee.

A lovely quiet place with a fairly large selection. I ordered from the prix fixe menu and had a great Salmorejo ( a cold tomato soup). The English version of the menu said cold tomato soup so I thought it would be gazpacho but it was this thick creamier cousin instead. It was a lovely discovery that I subsequently ordered multiple times elsewhere in Spain. I also had a wonderful cod. A delicious house wine was included in my meal My son had the risotto which was also marvelous. The staff are friendly and attentive.

On your recommendation, we went to Taberna El Sur last night and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. We arrived early for Madrid, around 7:15 pm, and easily found a table. We were well taken care of, and loved everything we tried. We ordered most of the items which had a star next to them. The meats were delicious, the sangria (mostly sangria and very little ice!!) was delicious, and the bread was delicious. You can order half portions of the meals, not tapas, so you can sample more items on the menu. They actually charge exactly half the price, which is very different from what we are used to in the U.S. Finally, it was 104 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday, and we were surprisingly comfortable.

It is situated only 10 minutes from the Museum de Prado and near the Sighseeeing Bus stops but takes a little finding but it is well worth it. We arrived at 1.20 believing they opned at 1.30 and the owner Pablo was setting up. He said he would be 10 minutes and said we were welcome to wait but did suggest there was another bar 1 minute away up the hill on the corner of the street if we fancied a drink and he would keep us a table. We wenet to this other bar which was also nice and enjoyed a nice drink there. We came back at just after 1.30 and were given a nice comfortable table and the restaurant soon started to fill. From the menu of the day (12.50 Euros for 3 course and a glass of wine) there were 4 starter and 4 main choices. My wife had the Tomato and Mozzarella salad which she said was gorgeous and I had the best Risotto I had tasted which had very fine strips of steak in it. For main I had a spicy ""Burger"" which was home -made and packed with flavour and came with a lovely salad. My wife ordered the Calamari but Pablo cam back after 15 minutes and said the quality of the produce was not up to his standard and was refusing to serve it. He said he had some Fresh Cod in which my wife was quite happy to have.He was very apologetic but my wife said her fish was perfectly cooked in a nice herb crust. We enjoyed plenty of fresh bread with our meals. For desserts there was either yogurt,cake or ice-cream. We had a yogurt and ice-cream which were both nice. We enjoyed two different types of Red Wine at 2 euros a glass and both were absolutley magnificent. Pablo was happy to talk to us and recommended two other typical Spanish restaurants which were again good. If you get a chance please go as we had a delightful afternoon but maybe booking is recommended as he did get busy and the restaurant maybe can seat 20 at maximum. The atmosphere was so relaxed that you did not feel intimated at any time by people close to you. Thank you Trip Advisor for finding this restauarant and thank you Pablo and his team !!",2013-11-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or450-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_21021,0.009,0.749,0.242,0.9991,0.3744543650793651,0.5932539682539685,0.4382099999999999,2217,216,0.0974289580514208,2,34,False,104,0.1607142857142857,0.1607142857142857,0.2857142857142857,0.0892857142857142,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0357142857142857,0.0178571428571428,430,232,4.158139534883721,0,0,found restaur thank trip advisor reserach went restaur good review decid go th lunchtim menu day situat minut museum de prado near sighsee bu stop take littl find well worth arriv believ opn owner pablo set said would minut said welcom wait suggest anoth bar minut away hill corner street fanci drink would keep us tabl wenet bar also nice enjoy nice drink came back given nice comfort tabl restaur soon start fill menu day euro cours glass wine starter main choic wife tomato mozzarella salad said gorgeou best risotto tast fine strip steak main spici burger home made pack flavour came love salad wife order calamari pablo cam back minut said qualiti produc standard refus serv said fresh cod wife quit happi apologet wife said fish perfectli cook nice herb crust enjoy plenti fresh bread meal dessert either yogurt cake ice cream yogurt ice cream nice enjoy two differ type red wine euro glass absolutley magnific pablo happi talk us recommend two typic spanish restaur good get chanc pleas go delight afternoon mayb book recommend get busi restaur mayb seat maximum atmospher relax feel intim time peopl close thank trip advisor find restauar thank pablo team,good review,4,Spanish

It was wonderful. The set menu was lovely done and quite original: I still remember the lentejas con bacalao as a starter then, the staff recommended wines to go with the food and I found the whole experience of eating great dishes in such a welcoming space really revitalising after gruelling work meetings. Fast forward two years on and I went back to Madrid for business and my treat was to get back to La Tragantua. Happy to report that they still do great food and in the same discreet corner of Madrid although I hear that they have a branch somewhere else. I may just comment that for me, the forte of La Tragantua are the starters. Main courses although very professionally created and visually attractive tend to be a little dry for my taste -the pulpo I had was indeed missing something that I could not pin down but it was superbly cooked. The staff is really lovely and for solo travellers like myself it makes such a difference to have a little corner of a city where one feels like at home. If I could make this place even more perfect, it would accept AMEX but that is a minor detail that hopefully one day will happen. Apart from that....Thank you Tragantua!

Pablo as mentioned by the previous reviewers was extremely polite and patient in explaining the menu to us in English and making superb recommendations. 4 of us had 2 starters (calamare and battered prawn, and fried tomatoes and peppers with mushrooms) and a main course each. I ordered the argentinian steak which was prepared to perfection for 11.90 euros.

We were early according to the local custom (2 pm) and we were greeted by the very kind waiter (which must be the owner, actually) as the only customers at the beginning. The place is small, but fancy and intimate. We went for the daily menu, which was surprisingly cheap (12.5 euros) even though it is a full meal (first course, second course, dessert) even including a glass of wine. After our order, more customers started to arrive, so we noticed with pleasure that, although the area is relatively touristic, they were all locals - this must mean something! The food is a blend of local tastes with some experimental recipes. The meat was very well prepared, and portions were more than satisfactory - if they asked the menu price just for the main course it would still be fair. Note that they do not serve just a steak or a plain soup, apparently the cook has enough taste to combine ingredients and flavors in some refined creations - but still it feels local. So, in the end we were extremely satisfied and definitely recommend this place if you are around the museums.

We booked way in advance this restaurant was recommended to us, and we were told how small it was. As per other reviews on here, we can certainly say the owner was very kind, humble and helpful. Its a very unique place, almost like a room in a house with a handful of tables, but having said, it did not lack in atmosphere. We had a recommended red wine with our dinners that was from the north of Spain. For starters, I had the prawns and calamari on sticks and my husband had the spinach soup. Sublime! Main course; I had the tuna with a sweet, sticky onion relish and my husband had the recommended cut of meat, which although was described as steak, it was rather fatty and not the ideal cut of meat to be cooked rare. For desserts we had the Napoleon cake and Chocolate cake, both were very nice. Total meal came to €70, which we thought was over all good value for money.  Clearly this place is popular as the owner had to turn a lot people away during the time we were there and he was full of apologies for having to do this. The restaurant was busy the whole time we were there.

Pablo (the owner) graciously squeezed us in despite being very booked for lunchtime. We were served a delicious 3 course price fix menu that composed of traditional Spanish food with some delightful twists. After eating at la terraza del casino the night before, we both felt we enjoyed the food here more. One week later, we returned to Madrid and came here for dinner. It was our only night in Madrid and this was the only place we wanted to go. The food was equally as good as the first time and it was the perfect, quaint setting we wanted to close out our tour of Spain. Pablo was one of the nicest people we met in Spain during our trip and we wish him and his business all the success in the future. La Tragantua's ranking of a top 100 restaurant in Madrid is well deserved and will definitely be back upon a return to Madrid.

We were actually on our way to another place just around the corner but arrived to find it closed, we walked back into El Sur as it was busy and thought we'd give it a go. Well it was worth it, what a pleasnt surprise for our first evening meal in Madrid. We ordered the Musaka, Peirejo Steak and the Squid Salad. All of which were great but the Squid was absolutely phenominal. I love my seafood and have had squid thousands of times but last nights dish was the best squid i have ever had! That awsome charcoal/grill flavor, so soft and tender and full of juices it was amazing. The musaka is also a great dish, quite unique as we have never had something like it before and the peirejo (sorry about the spelling) is cooked to perfection. The warm crusty bread on the side was the perfect with the dishes. We ordered two Gin and Tonics and were a bit puzzled as to why the waitress was bringing the entire bottle over to our table. She poured into these giant glasses and told us to say stop when we thought we had enough! Was a great laugh!  To top it off they give you two shots on the house just before you leave which was a nice finish.  Highly recommended.

OK the review: very small place not good for families. At best 2-3 people. Staff very friendly so that's great.  The sangria is quite good and made fresh each time one orders it.  Food: not really Spanish as you may think. More like fusion with bold flavors from around the world. We had cream of tomato soup which was gazpacho style- it was ok. Not sure if the cold prep of soup came out as intended.  Papas with spicy sauce came with a chipotle/curry flavor which was too overpowering for the dish. Barbacoa type beef was very good servied with freshly fried potato chips.  Fillet (pork) was interesting- had a glaze on it which was a strongly reduced in a grape/plum sauce.  Curried chicken was another interesting dish- served with a mild curry sauce on a breast fillet with rice. Sauce was underpowered.  One can get a sense that the chef is certainly trying to go for something different here. I have no issues with that. It's just that overall, the flavors did not seem to wow me.

We all had a fab night and I would definitely recommend as a good place to see an authentic Flamenco show in Madrid. Positive : The Show was great, both the dancers and the singers. The costumes are colourful with many changes through the night and the dancers really put their hearts into the performance. The previous reviews said the food was average. Everything we ate was delicious! Very Authentic and intimate show. Negative (to be aware of but didn't spoil our night) You are a little cramped in and the chairs are not the most conformable But it is bearable for the 1.5 hour show.

Went there for the 11pm show with a drink. We paid 30 euros each. There was just the two of us and another 2 person group there that night. It was a small intimate place but the performance was excellent. Despite the small crowd the energy from the performers was amazing. All of the performers were great, especially ""Paola"" (I believe that was her name). She put 110% into her performance and can see that she was passionate about her art. We also went to Chinitas later in the week and there were more performers and more expensive than Mr Pinkleton. However, if you are in La Latina this is a great venue to see a Flamenco show.

We emailed them to get a reservation and they responded within 24 hours. With a ticket purchase, you can either choose show plus one drink or show plus dinner. My boyfriend and I chose the show plus drink option. When we arrived there and were seated in the front row. On the table, they had complementary chips and a trail mix. They promptly came and got our drink order. Throughout the show, the waiters will also take order if you'd like more drinks than the complementary 1 drink. As for the flamenco show itself, it was very entertaining. I have never experienced one before (except what you see on Dancing with the Stars, lol). Those dancers really got their sweat on and demonstrated that it takes a lot of work and talent to do the flamenco. The guy on the classical guitar was phenomenal, as well as the singers. They performed two sets with a 10 minute break between the sets. At the end of the show, they pulled people from the audience to learn flamenco and my boyfriend was one of them! Overall, the drinks were great and the entertainment was even better. I loved learning about flamenco and watching it live was a great experience. Things to note: They do speak spanish throughout the whole show, so if you speak any other language then atleast you've been warned. But honestly, the dancing itself just encompasses you and transcends the language barriers.",2017-08-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3847118-Reviews-or180-La_Taberna_de_Mister_Pinkleton-Madrid.html,UID_21117,0.005,0.907,0.088,0.9603,0.3325757575757576,0.4991666666666667,0.2156666666666666,1510,130,0.086092715231788,1,37,False,41,0.1176470588235294,0.0588235294117647,0.3235294117647059,0.088235294117647,0.2941176470588235,0.0294117647058823,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0294117647058823,0.0,269,179,4.617100371747212,0,0,airbnb host suggest us go show short stay madrid three night show h h h email get reserv respond within hour ticket purchas either choos show plu one drink show plu dinner boyfriend chose show plu drink option arriv seat front row tabl complementari chip trail mix promptli came got drink order throughout show waiter also take order like drink complementari drink flamenco show entertain never experienc one except see danc star lol dancer realli got sweat demonstr take lot work talent flamenco guy classic guitar phenomen well singer perform two set minut break set end show pull peopl audienc learn flamenco boyfriend one overal drink great entertain even better love learn flamenco watch live great experi thing note speak spanish throughout whole show speak languag atleast warn honestli danc encompass transcend languag barrier,good review,4,Spanish

I'm glad we did. The venue is small, so even if you are seated towards the back of the room, like we were, you can see the stage very well. I just wish the chairs had been a bit more comfortable! We didn't make reservations, just tried our luck by showing up a half hour before the early show on a Sunday, and we were able to get seats. The young hostess is very friendly and efficient. We chose not to have dinner, just wine, as most people seemed to do. I'm not sure why someone would choose dinner. Usually the food at flamenco shows is not exceptional, and I'd prefer to give my attention to the people on stage rather than a meal.  We thought the performers were excellent. There were 5---a female dancer, a male and female singer, and a male guitar player. I would have enjoyed seeing a male dancer as well---which they probably have on Friday and Saturday nights---but the performers were talented and enthusiastic, and the show was very enjoyable. I especially liked the guitar player and the female dancer. One thing they did that was different and fun, was to bring up 4 women from the audience to have a flamenco lesson. It was a nice touch---and the women were surprisingly good. Overall, we were pleased with the show and the venue, and would recommend it.",2017-07-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3847118-Reviews-or180-La_Taberna_de_Mister_Pinkleton-Madrid.html,UID_152,0.007,0.78,0.213,0.9956,0.2607638888888888,0.5146450617283951,0.3410066666666667,1384,125,0.0903179190751445,1,48,False,42,0.1904761904761904,0.1587301587301587,0.3174603174603174,0.0793650793650793,0.2063492063492063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0476190476190476,0.0,254,158,4.448818897637795,0,0,heard good thing show want tri differ place one visit last year glad venu small even seat toward back room like see stage well wish chair bit comfort make reserv tri luck show half hour earli show sunday abl get seat young hostess friendli effici chose dinner wine peopl seem sure someon would choos dinner usual food flamenco show except prefer give attent peopl stage rather meal thought perform excel femal dancer male femal singer male guitar player would enjoy see male dancer well probabl friday saturday night perform talent enthusiast show enjoy especi like guitar player femal dancer one thing differ fun bring women audienc flamenco lesson nice touch women surprisingli good overal pleas show venu would recommend,good review,4,Spanish

The venue is small and quite intimate, the food lovely and the show entertaining. However, a slight negative for me was that we were up on a little balcony bit (great view of stage) so were maybe slightly overlooked by staff/more difficult to get their attention. It wasn't until the end when they came round with the bill that we told them we had not yet had our second drink or dessert. They then proceeded to get these for us which was good but we had to be very quick as they were preparing the tables around us for the next show. Difficult to enjoy a nice dessert and drink when you're wolfing it down! The overall experience was pleasurable and I would definitely recommend to a friend. Just make sure you eat quickly and are able to get the staff's attention!",2016-11-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3847118-Reviews-or230-La_Taberna_de_Mister_Pinkleton-Madrid.html,UID_21127,0.036,0.766,0.198,0.9848,0.1410555555555555,0.5274444444444445,0.424575,907,89,0.0981256890848952,2,18,False,42,0.108695652173913,0.1956521739130435,0.3043478260869565,0.0434782608695652,0.2391304347826087,0.0,0.0,0.0217391304347826,0.0434782608695652,0.0434782608695652,168,119,4.404761904761905,0,0,boyfriend went friend recommend book show dinner come free drink dessert also venu small quit intim food love show entertain howev slight neg littl balconi bit great view stage mayb slightli overlook staff difficult get attent end came round bill told yet second drink dessert proceed get us good quick prepar tabl around us next show difficult enjoy nice dessert drink wolf overal experi pleasur would definit recommend friend make sure eat quickli abl get staff attent,bad review,2,French

The singers were good, the main flamenco dancer was fantastic (can't believe feet can move like that!), but the glue that held the show together was the really fantastic playing by the guy with the acoustic guitar.  This was such a pleasant diversion from a busy day of being a tourist. Included in the 25 Euro fee was one drink and some snacks. We ate dinner at one of the nearby restaurants after the show. Dinner is available with the show but I can't speak to the quality. All in all, a very fun night just off the Plaza Mayor.

It was a perfect depiction of a traditional Spanish dance, song, and music. I am sure that it is very touristy- but it is so much fun!  We went for dinner, drinks, and a show at 9pm. It cost 55 euro per person. Each person got 2 drinks, 3 meal choices, snacks, and dessert.  The dancer was phenomenal, I fell in love with Spanish women and their ability to be completely sexy and cool, swinging their hips, and not taking anything off! The costumes were beautiful and authentic, I loved every second of the dancing.  The singers were traditional Spanish singers - they sang a few songs that people in the audience knew, so we had a sing along  For the food: they had ""hats"" pictured on the menu that were your choices - some items had 1 hat, others 2. You could choose 3 hats per person. It was so much food. For a couple, 6 hats was too many!  We had paella, cheese, ham, pork loin, and dessert. The paella was 2 hats and was enough for about 4 people! We did not use all of our hats with all of that food.  The gin and tonics counted as 2 drinks, but it was massive so completely understood why it was 2 drinks. The red wine was good, nothing extremely special though, it went well with dinner. The second drink was sangria - and my guy loved it.  We split a chocolate pie for dessert (we each could have had one, but it was so much food!)  All in all, the good food, drink, and the amazing show was well worth the price of the tickets!  **stop by before the show and reserve a spot, when we visited, they had shows at 7, 9, and 11.

Booked online via Flamenco Tickets and everything was booked and ready for us when we arrived. Did the first show of the evening as we had plans for later - also didn't eat here, just booked the show with a drink - but there was also nuts and crisps on the table to nibble. A small venue which makes it quite personal and easy to see. Very enlightening performance of traditional flamenco from passionate performers.

The food was very good and reasonably priced. The starter of prawns and squid skewers were plenty to share between two people and were very tasty.  Both mains were really tasty, particularly the black rice dish which takes a while to cook but is well worth the wait. The rice dishes can be ordered for just one person whereas a lot of other places insist on two sharing.  The service is friendly and efficient and the waiting staff speak English (there is also an English menu).

La Malontina is a perfect spot for that lunch as it is a short walk to either museum. However, this place is popular (for good reason), so do try to make a reservation. We weren't sure where to eat as we left our first museum and we found this place through Google Maps.

It was so refreshing with a strong fish flavour. Pasta was just so-so. The pesto sauce with lot of cheese was alright but the soggy texture of the past made it a failure.  Quite a number of dishes we had came with mushrooms. At least it was good, but when the mushroom sauce appeared for the third time with the pork and was much too strong for the meat, we got tired of it. Dessert was not worth mentioning. We’d better just get the yoghurt we like from the supermarket. It would have been better than the flavoured yoghurt we had here. The place was so packed. Tables were put close together. Service was hearty though,  making up for the uncomfortable seating and the price was definitely worth mentioning, it was good value for money.",2019-05-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or10-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_21159,0.077,0.698,0.225,0.976,0.1972222222222222,0.5009259259259259,0.4505272727272728,767,69,0.089960886571056,0,17,False,30,0.1538461538461538,0.1153846153846153,0.2307692307692307,0.1153846153846153,0.1153846153846153,0.0384615384615384,0.0384615384615384,0.0384615384615384,0.1153846153846153,0.0384615384615384,141,92,4.432624113475177,0,0,love cod pate refresh strong fish flavour pasta pesto sauc lot chees alright soggi textur past made failur quit number dish came mushroom least good mushroom sauc appear third time pork much strong meat got tire dessert worth mention better get yoghurt like supermarket would better flavour yoghurt place pack tabl put close togeth servic hearti though make uncomfort seat price definit worth mention good valu money,average review,3,Italian

The restaurant is cosy small, with about ten tables. We were first to arrive at 9 pm, but the restaurant was full in less than an hour with nearly all people who had made reservations. The waitresses were friendly and helpful and the owner/chef greeted everyone at their tables. There were three pre fix tasting menus as well as a nicely balanced a la Carte menu, one side Spanish and one side English. We were given a starter amuse bouche of a soup, cream of mushroom which was fine. We ordered a salad and two entrees to share. The salad was a tasty combination of assorted greens topped by a grilled goat cheese. Our entrees were a truffle mushroom risotto and octopus. I’ve had slightly more tender octopus, but the subtle spices and the grilling were first class. The risotto rice was perfect al dente with a nice creamy texture and mushroom flavor. We finished off with two desserts, one of which was a pianono a la Santa Fe. I don’t know pianonos well and was both surprised and pleased by the creation.

We arrived early to avoid queues (about 830) and had a short wait at the bar where we were served some tasty beer and cocktails with nuts to snack on whilst we waited. Within maybe 20 mins we had a table and sat down ready to enjoy a meal. We ordered the squid, a Cuban spiced meat dish, potato's and a salmon skewer - which were all amazing. We ordered half sizes so we could try more things and it was a perfect amount of food for 3. Delicious crusty bread also accompanied the meal. We had the sangria which was delicious, the guys also generously gave us complimentary shots containing 'secret' ingredients which were fruity and delicious and served with a smile and they also recommended a delicious red wine to try as well. What we loved a lot about this place was it felt like being at a friends house but in a bar/Cafe setting.. It was a place where like minded people could meet and make friends which we saw a lot of and did ourselves! The team working there were lovely and most spoke excellent English which was great for people like us who bumble our way through Spanish!

We did have a reservation which was advantageous as people were turned away after we arrived who had not booked. We had to wait nearly 15 minutes before our order was taken, however you could entertain yourself on the samsung tablet which doubles as a menu in your language of choice. It was busy but it is a small restaurant so you really should not have to wait that long for your order to be taken.  Starters of fried green tomato with goats cheese and boletus (mushroom) was okay, it was not very warm but tasted good. Salad of arugula (rocket) with apple, walnut and blue cheese was overdressed and very rich which was a shame as the dressing just overpowered the dish. Mains of hake with potato and sweet relish did not work well together and the hake was a little dry but the cod with basil sauce a better choice and tasted really good.

The taberna has about 9 tables at the back and a few high tables in the bar area and it quickly filled up. The staff were very helpful and nice. We started with a small mixed salad, followed by the seafood paella and the sirloin strips, with another small salad to accompany it. The paella was delicious (much better than the more expensive one we had on Plaza Mayor).  The beef had lots of flavour. The Rioja was great.

The owner and the staff are truly masters of hospitality - you wont find better in Madrid! The staff were quick, and efficient, but not rushed - always time for a smile and a few pleasant words before they went off to their next table. The food was absolutely perfect! (a lot of the dishes come with wooden skewers... if you have unruly children, you should probably NOT bring them to this restaurant, for the safety of the other guests! LOL!). The owner took time to discuss our choice of wine, bringing us a few bottles of his own suggestion to explore, along with the wine list (a book of peeled wine bottle labels... which is *exactly* the method I use to remember the wines I have loved! So, for me, this was the most perfect way of presenting me a wine list!).  VALUE: Wow... It's hard to understand how the owner stays in business with such a small restaurant, such high-quality food, at such low prices! Basically, you're getting a Michelin 1-star meal for the same price as your local Taverna!! It's absurd!! LOL! For my partner and I, a bottle of wine, a shared starter, two mains, and a shared dessert (plus the chef's""amuse bouche"") for EUR65. Best value-for-money I've had in Madrid. ""Etiquette"": Like most Spanish restaurants, you should make a reservation. I did not (bad bad bad!). However, my partner and I arrived early in the evening, and the owner was gracious, and friendly, and offered us a table with the caveat that we couldn't occupy the space all night because it was reserved for another couple later in the evening. THAT is, to me, the kind of warm and reasonable attention that I really appreciate! He did not make us feel uncomfortable or awkward, he simply explained the situation, and asked if we were OK with dine-and-dash LOL! We were! ...and I am *so* grateful to the owner for accommodating us in this way! Next time, I will make a reservation!

It seemed as if the waiter(s) felt too superior to give us what we ordered. We asked three times for olive oil and vinegar. The rude reply of the waiter was ""yes, if I have time I can bring it"", finally after asking a fourth time the waiter said in a sarcastic way ""I hope it pleases you NOW"". Also they pushed you away if they tried to pass you. A nice ""Excuse me"" would be much better. Next to this we had to the feeling to appologize when ordering drinks. What they seem to not understand is that we were the customers who were paying and thus should be served promptly and politely. The food was fine. Not delicate.

We found it a little difficult to find as we didn't have wifi and its was down a little empty side street. But eventully we did, an oh my! It was packed!! We couldn't even get through the door as the queue was coming out!  But we decided to stick with it and ask how long it would take for a table, and he told us wait a little and he would do find out... Then he said would we mind going to his newly opened second branch that opened 2 days ago, same food just a bit bigger. We agreed as we really wanted to find out what the fuss was about.  The guy turned out to be the owner and TOOK us there!! It was only a few minutes walk and we had a conversation on the way. Really friendly guy, he then showed us to the table and left us with his partner who was so friendly also.  The place was a little bigger and wasn't as busy (now totally a bad thing), nice and bright with Art Deco on the walls. Now to the food..... Great!! We wanted to try everything but worried that it would be too much, no problem, we could order half portions!!! Wow!  We ordered the pork stew, pork loin in sauce, Mussaka which were tasty, but they have the best grilled squid I've ever tasted! I even ordered another portion!! I don't know how they did it but it was just so tasty, melt in the mouth and soft, so much flavour. The best thing about this place for me was the friendly staff, the owners both seemed so proud of their place and enjoyed working there. They would answer all our questions and were so friendly!  We ended going there again after lunch to try other foods on their menu and we were greeted as if we were old friends.  I know I've blabbed on a bit but this is my first post on trip advisor and I just wanted to express my enjoyment of this place. Overall, the location and venue might not be all that... But the food and service is second to none. All of this and it didn't break the bank! If I lived in Madrid, this would be my regular place.  I hope to return there again soon.

We came as a family of 5 for lunch after visiting the Prado museum. It was an incredible meal, each dish is made with love and has its own unique flare. There are foods from all around the world such as the Thai Chicken (which was really delicious) and the cold tomato soup (also yum). We all had different dishes and we liked all of them, which says alot about a group of 5 opinionated eaters. The price was very good for all the dishes. Some of us opted for the daily menu meaning you get a starter, entree, dessert and a drink this was 18 euros and we found it to be very reasonable + we were certainly full after. The other members of our party opted for just the entree and they too were very reasonably priced (12-20 euros depending on the dish if I am not mistaken). Apart from the food what stood out was the excellent hospitality. The owner of the restaurant was there and he explained about the origins of some of the dishes to us, he was kind enough to give us an extra dessert just because and even point us in the right direction for our next sightseeing stop. I highly recommend this place as a food stop near the prado or if you want to have a memorable meal in Madrid.

I had all the relevant Spanish phrases up on Google translate but no need! Pablo, the owner, could not have been more friendly, took my booking and, when I mentioned that it was a birthday do, assured me he would organise something. And he did. The place is small, very small, so strongly advise booking. Also, it wasn't the easiest place to find so maybe leave a little time to find it. Pablo and his wonderful wife were front of house and a more friendly, dedicated, sociable couple you would be hard pushed to find. We were a table of 6 and Pablo recommended his tasting menu. This consisted of a mixture of, I think, 6 starter courses and a couple of main ones. And the deal was this - He brought you plates of food and we shared. He made it absolutely clear that if we wanted more he would bring more (we did and he did). And then there were 3 or 4 deserts and coffee. Wine (which was excellent) and water was included to be consumed at will, We consumed at will.  The cost? €33 a head all in. Outstanding value! The food? Excellent. Fried brie with fruity sauces, goat's cheese, Serrano ham and peppers, calamari and prawns sticks, spiced meatballs, mushroom risotto and others I'm ashamed not to remember (the wine, perhaps). The birthday? Pablo arranged his delicious deserts into the shape of 75, added candles and brought it to the table. We sang.

Since the place was full and we didn’t have a reservation, we put our name down for a table. We were told that it would be a five minute wait for a table. 20mins passed and still there was no table. We were then asked to sit by the bar and order a drink as there were people leaving and we were told a table was being made ready. Another 15mins passed, only for us to see others being seated. Upon enquiring if we would be getting a table, we were informed there were no tables for three! (That was surprising since we had just seen a family of four leave and a table becoming available).  If there were no tables for three, why wasn’t this informed upfront rather than have us wait for over 30 mins? Why ask us to sit at the bar and get drinks while saying a table was being made ready? At that point, we had to order and eat lunch at the bar (much to our dismay). An hour into the meal, there were no waiters checking on us and we were pretty much left forgotten at the bar. However the lady at the bar could see that we were extremely displeased and she spoke to the other waitstaff to organise a table. Mid-way through our meal, a table was made available. We however decided to finish our meal at the bar and leave. Except the lady at the bar who was trying to assist, the rest of the waitstaff seemed indifferent, lackadaisical. The experience was terribly disappointing; we will certainly not be returning to this restaurant.",2019-04-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or490-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_21318,0.1,0.859,0.041,-0.9354,0.1273313492063492,0.5522073412698413,0.39625625,1493,150,0.1004688546550569,1,32,False,69,0.15,0.025,0.125,0.1,0.05,0.05,0.025,0.075,0.225,0.175,284,151,4.257042253521127,0,0,famili three visit restaur lunch sinc place full reserv put name tabl told would five minut wait tabl min pass still tabl ask sit bar order drink peopl leav told tabl made readi anoth min pass us see other seat upon enquir would get tabl inform tabl three surpris sinc seen famili four leav tabl becom avail tabl three inform upfront rather us wait min ask us sit bar get drink say tabl made readi point order eat lunch bar much dismay hour meal waiter check us pretti much left forgotten bar howev ladi bar could see extrem displeas spoke waitstaff organis tabl mid way meal tabl made avail howev decid finish meal bar leav except ladi bar tri assist rest waitstaff seem indiffer lackadais experi terribl disappoint certainli return restaur,very bad review,1,French

It was 10:30pm and the place was packed so we figured it should serve good food. Fortunately enough the friendly waiter gave us a table although we did not book ahead. Haven't had meat for a while I was thinking of ordering the steak as the description was enticing but wisely didn't as it would fill me up too quickly. Instead we chose seafood as the range available was huge. We could not go wrong since you order by the weight. We picked shrimps, red prawns, cockles & lobster. One word , heavenly!

The place is quite small and busy (Friday night!). The waiter was very helpful and friendly. His English was not the best, but he tried to help and explain as much as he could and advised us to take the plate with 4 sauces (for 2 people). This turned out to be the perfect size. The food was extremely well cooked. I don't think I've had better fries in my entire life. The sauces we had were all great and went perfectly with our meat and fries. If you like garlic definitely get Aioli. Bravas and their special Gandario sauce are musts are well. For a small extra charge (I believe 50 cents) you can order extra sauces (which we did, since they all sounded so good and we couldn't limit ourselves to 4). Apart from their famous fries-meat-sauces plates, they also offer tapas. Since we were full already, we didn't try this. For drinks, they have a good selection of wines. My boyfriend tried the Tinto de Verano, which is a must in Spain. It is similar to Sangria, but lighter and better. Many locals came here for drinking as well.

We were lucky to snag a table for lunch without a reservation and enjoyed one of the best meals of our two-week trip to Spain. I had a first course of mushroom ravioli with a salmon sauce and a second course of ""wok"" sirloin with stir fried vegetables. My husband had the pepper wrapped in prosciutto and, for the second course, the beef with honey. All were superb. We also had desserts - because the meal included them -- which were all right, nothing special. During the whole meal, we kept wondering if we had misunderstood the price -- 12.5 Euros for first course, second course, bread, dessert and drink of our choice. No, we hadn't. So, in addition to being a most delicious meal, it was also the best value meal.
