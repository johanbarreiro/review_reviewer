We walked in without a reservation and were greeted and treat as though we had. The owner was very pleasant and helpful. The Menu de Dia was just flat out SUPERB. Forgot to take a picture of the salad because it was so well presented and also tasted great - simply a small head of Bibb lettuce cut into quarters with goat cheese, nuts and a delicate balsamic dressing. My wife had the salmorejo which was similarly delicate and quite fine. Entrees were a Turkish style ground filet and a superb hake. The desserts were also quite nice. It is small - 7-8 tables and intimate.  Walk around, get lost, ask directions but find this restaurant.

The restaurant is tucked away down a little street away from the madding crowds of Madrid. It is small and cosy but has a lovely atmosphere, lovely staff. We had three dishes, a full salad and half portions of the tapas. It was very nice food and more than enough for two of us. With a couple of beers the bill came to around 25 euros which for a good meal in Madrid was not too bad. Some of the reviews recommended going early which we did, around 8pm, however the place was quite busy at this time so something to bear in mind.

We can see why because it is very small. The manager/owner greeted us and said he has another restaurant with the same food and it's not far. He asked a girl to show us. We were served by William. What a great guy! He used his limited English and we used our limited Espanol, but because I already looked through via TripAdvisor and Google reviews...it was a lot easier to decide. When our orders came out. Wow...I mean wow! Chipirones, musaka, Gambones, risotto, Vieja (Cuban pulled pork)...it was impressively good for an alley restaurant!  When comes to Spanish tapas, I would highly recommend medios (half or small) orders and everyone can share and get a taste of many different dishes. I would avoid ordering large portions and do the Americano style of single order for yourself. We were already pretty stuffed and had a great smile after those great dishes. I wish I had room for Pulpo (octopus). William asked if we had room for desert, and after letting him know we would decline, he decided to give us a shot of ""Bailey"" type Irish coffee drink and a shot of cranberry refresher for my daughter. Great guy, friendly, service with a smile. He really put icing on our day after our hot one day trip to Toledo! All this only came to 31.60 Euro.

I took a warm salad with mushrooms, fantastic, and as a main course, chicken. The fish in papillotte was great too. The owner is between the tables, always asking you about the service.

For example, we had beef stew with honey and burger ""From Russia to Turkey"". Its innovative but the best word to describe the taste of both dishes is ""interesting"".  What really stood out was the service. The menu is an ipad with multilingual support. We compared both the Chinese and English translations before ordering. In English, it said fillet, and in Chinese, it said fish. So I thought I ordered the fish fillet. You can imagine my surprise when I was served a beef hamburger. We decide to keep it but the owner noticed our surprise and brought a fish dish. We didn't take it because we were full. But the gesture was greatly appreciated.

Not to say that they don't use a deep fryer at el Sur, but they offer a variety of dishes that don't solely involve being smothered in oil. They offer crisps (emphasis on CRISP) with a select few of their entrees that are definitely worth eating. Another significant standout was the fact that they offered fresh, delicious salads. We had the white wine sangria, moussaka as an appetizer, the ropa vieja, the el sur salad and the beetroot cake (also known as red velvet cake) for desert. Everything was great, the service was wonderful and they gave us a complimentary shot after our meal which consisted of mint and hibiscus (we think) which was nice and refreshing- overall, great experience.

I called for a reservation the same night and they were very accommodating - telling me to let them know 5 minutes before I get there. We ended up early, so we had a 10 minute wait. It is a small, busy restaurant with more seating toward the back where you cannot see. There is no street seating. The service was very attentive, but a few large families were there the same time as my family of 5. It meant we had one item missed (eggplant - and I forgot to check the bill - it was charged). On the plus side, the food is very tasty. For Madrid, it is also very reasonably priced. We went with the Cuban Ropa Vieja which was good, the recommended curry chicken which was fantastic, chiparones (small squid) - again excellent, and a vegetable eggplant dish. The half portions were ample to feed the 5 of us. I had a glass of wine while my wife enjoyed a margarita. At the end of the meal, I had a Pedro Ximenez which they comped.

This is a great little restaurant with the most amazing service and food. It was our favorite meal in Spain and maybe one of my most favorite of anywhere I've been.  It does not open until 9 pm and if you go even a little before it will be closed up and dark but don't worry they will be open right at 9 and will welcome you with open arms. We ordered a couple of small plates to start and were given a complimentary tasting which turned out to be one of the small plates we had already ordered. When they realized that we had actually ordered that item, they brought out another complimentary dish for us to try.  For our main courses we both ordered the risotto. I had the mushroom truffle risotto and my mother had the beef and pepper risotto. Both of them were so good and we both are still talking about our meal to this day!  I also could not believe how inexpensive our meal was! We had so much food plus dessert and wine and when we got the bill I did a double take because it was so low. I had just had a similar meal in Chicago and paid about 3 times as much. With all of that being said about the food, the service is even better. We were so welcomed by everyone there. We do not speak Spanish and that did not matter at all. Everyone spoke English and made sure we were taken care of throughout the evening.  If you go to Madrid you need to go to this restaurant. Our trip was very short so we didn't get to go back but we would definitely have tried. We are already trying to figure out when we can go back just so we can eat that risotto!",2017-01-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or130-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_21456,0.013,0.844,0.144,0.9941,0.212562656641604,0.4657351712614871,0.3539,1695,190,0.1120943952802359,3,26,False,71,0.1296296296296296,0.2037037037037037,0.2592592592592592,0.0555555555555555,0.1851851851851851,0.0,0.0,0.0185185185185185,0.0925925925925925,0.0555555555555555,336,182,4.035714285714286,0,0,begin express happi found restaur made reserv long trip happi great littl restaur amaz servic food favorit meal spain mayb one favorit anywher open pm go even littl close dark worri open right welcom open arm order coupl small plate start given complimentari tast turn one small plate alreadi order realiz actual order item brought anoth complimentari dish us tri main cours order risotto mushroom truffl risotto mother beef pepper risotto good still talk meal day also could believ inexpens meal much food plu dessert wine got bill doubl take low similar meal chicago paid time much said food servic even better welcom everyon speak spanish matter everyon spoke english made sure taken care throughout even go madrid need go restaur trip short get go back would definit tri alreadi tri figur go back eat risotto,good review,4,Italian

We were not disappointed! Lovely small establishment - cosy but not cramped and with a good buzz. We managed to beat the rush and were seated at about 7.45pm. Staff were excellent - friendly and genuinely happy to help with recommending dishes and translating into English when required. I chose one of the specials and it was the best meal I had during my stay in Madrid - superbly flavoursome steak with roquefort sauce. My partner had a fish special and said it was divine. The place was busy but we didn't feel rushed at any point. We liked the place so much it didn't take much convincing to stay for pudding, especially after having seen some amazing looking cakes on display as we arrived! I had a HUGE slice of banana cake. Usually I find cakes in mnay restaurants either look good or taste good - but this one ticked both boxes and to my delight was served in a ridiculously generous portion (although I wouldn't have left a crumb!). My boyf loved the homemade berry cheesecake. And the icing on the banana cake was.....the cost for our food and two beers was a piddlingly small amount - something like 30 euros which for the quality and experience was amazing. Really excellent. If we come to Madrid again we'll be back!

We easily made an online reservation and were treated to excellent food and warm service at a reasonable price. Others have noted that La Tragantua can be difficult to find and is not in the precise location shown on the linked map.

The prices are very reasonable -- especially for the lunch menu -- and the food is great. I'd suggest trying the mushroom appetizer and the shrimp & eel risotto.

The menu is available online, and enticed us from the start, but it's nothing to the presentation and flavor. The restaurant is quite small, but stylish and modern. Service is very good, and the owner comes around to each table. But the true star of the evening is the food.  The flavors come together wonderfully, and the presentation is beautiful. Every dish was incredibly delicious. On our dinner visit we had the apple and goat cheese salad and the shrimp and calamari skewers to start, and the beef risotto and pork with vegetables for entrees, and every bite was to die for. I can't recommend the food enough! In fact, this as the only restaurant we ate at twice on our trip, returning for lunch on our last day. They have a menu of the day for lunch with bread, drink, starter, entree, and dessert for 12.5€. Everything was exactly as delicious as dinner, and the best deal we got this whole trip.

The lunch special is a great value, about 14 euros for a drink, 2 courses, and dessert or coffee. I opted for pasta in a creamy tomato sauce that was absolutely divine. My second course was hake, which was also good. My husband had the vegetable wok, which I sampled and was delicious. Between the pasta and wok, I can't decide which was better. For dessert, we had the flan and hazelnut ice cream. The flan was good, just like any other flan. The ice cream was thick and creamy. No complaints there. As for the service, it was also impeccable. Our plates were cleared off the table almost immediately after we finished each course, and were replaced with the next.

As we walked in Pablo the owner hosted us like a friend. Ask to wait 5 minutes because it was full the rest, they have 7 tables. Three minutes later we were set up. The lovely waitresses also helped us with the understanding of the plates and suggestion of wine.  We had a bottle of amazing wine Coto de Hayas and an amazing blue cheese as entree.

Meat choices change depending on what is brought in. The atmosphere is that of an indoor street with people strolling by with packages and wine glasses. The area to sit is crowded with seats and tables for perhaps 25-30, elbow to elbow. Don't expect a table cloth experience or quiet dining.  Food is served on a metal cookie sheet with boiled potatoes or a finely chopped slaw and a few slices of toasted baguette. But every bite is so good! Christina served us, she brought the meat to the table to explain the cuts and flavor and took our order. It was late and she served the entire restaurant, but we noticed that she treated every single table as though they were the first of the evening. She speaks English well.

After almost a week in Spain we were looking for more substance over the traditional - and mostly fried - tapas offerings. El Sur did not disappoint!

The tortilla de patatas was the most delicious, creamy version I’ve ever had! The goat cheese and spinach ravioli were delicate and flavorful. The service was efficient and friendly.

Service was friendly and all in all good. Lacking English skills made communication interesting, but were no obstacle. We chose various tacos, which arrived after one another at the table. Some of the tacos did not quite hit our taste, but as that is individual taste, we do not fault anybody for that as the craftsmanship was fine. The portions were very small however, also for conceived satiety dishes which really were needed due to the general small portion size.

The neighbourhood is a little oasis within the city filled with trees and lovely buildings. Adrede offers a warm and inviting setting with typical Spanish dishes reminding me of Spanish home cooking. The Salmorejo was divine and the pastel of leek was mouth watering. The service is really good and overall, this is a great place to consider for lunch or dinner while in Madrid.

It was located perfectly for us - between the Prado and El Retiro, just right for a post-museum lunch before siesta in the park.

We ordered a lot of things and were happy with all of them - delicious gazpacho, a very light and fluffy leek quiche, some sausage with french fries that was indulgent and huge.

It is the traditional restaurant in Spain: a bar , an area beside the bar to sit and drink, and another area which is for lunch/dinner TAPAS: in the ""bar"" area .typical bar table, with oily and fat tapas, that's what we want. You can order the little beer or the doble beer. Normal prices. Bartender are ""straigh to the point"" professional, efficient and loud, which could sound a bit rough for foreigner, but it is totally normal in Spain, I appreciate that. I don't like poshy bartenders. DINNER / LUNCH with reservation: The lobster is taken alive from the aquarium at the entrance, so it is super fresh ! they are specialized in rices, they prepare the paella as soon as you order , something that needs to be taken into account in quality (many places warm rice again taken from a pot prepared earlier). My aunt and my mother were super happy. We had anchovies and tuna for starter, and then the speciality of the house lobster paella. We ordered coffee and dessert for three, and the restaurant gave us the shots of digestive alcool for free . Total price was 115 euros, which is not that much for three people. I never went there without reservation There is a guy there who speak many languages lately, so I guess he was hired to help with foreigners. CONCLUSION: I would say that you need to know how the spanish life is to appreciate it, but it general it is very good for my taste. Maybe the tapas are a little bit to fat haha (But when we go there to get drunk with friends after work it is even better )",2014-06-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1235635-Reviews-or50-Restaurante_Arroceria_Puerta_de_Atocha-Madrid.html,UID_21638,0.016,0.811,0.173,0.9954,0.1975555555555556,0.5337777777777778,0.4536642857142857,1615,142,0.0879256965944272,1,49,False,75,0.14,0.12,0.3,0.04,0.2,0.0,0.04,0.02,0.08,0.06,305,194,4.298360655737705,0,0,went mani time local madrid beer tapa eat dinner tradit restaur spain bar area besid bar sit drink anoth area lunch dinner tapa bar area typic bar tabl oili fat tapa want order littl beer dobl beer normal price bartend straigh point profession effici loud could sound bit rough foreign total normal spain appreci like poshi bartend dinner lunch reserv lobster taken aliv aquarium entranc super fresh special rice prepar paella soon order someth need taken account qualiti mani place warm rice taken pot prepar earlier aunt mother super happi anchovi tuna starter special hous lobster paella order coffe dessert three restaur gave us shot digest alcool free total price euro much three peopl never went without reserv guy speak mani languag late guess hire help foreign conclus would say need know spanish life appreci gener good tast mayb tapa littl bit fat haha go get drunk friend work even better,average review,3,Spanish

So that 22-euro dish will end up costing the pair of you a cool 44 euros.  Also, we had assumed the bread and butter that appeared on our table (without our having ordered it) was complimentary, but we were charged four euros for it.

Bernardo was so welcoming and gave the best service we experienced during six days in Madrid. The restaurant was not busy which was impossible to believe. The meal was exceptional including the best seafood paella I have eaten (and that's quite a lot!). The wine was also excellent and the whole meal represented brilliant value for money. Bernardo and his colleagues presented the meal to us with great pride and this pride was totally justified. The total experience was one for which you would expect to spend a great deal more. A word of warning - don't be put off by the appearance outside. The photos of the food outside the door do the food inside no justice at all. It is immeasurably superior.

So when I give a place a 5 in my review, which is not often, it means it is exceptional. Steakburger is one of those rare ones. I visited the Luchana branch as I was staying in the area. It's not the most touristy part of Madrid, but if you are staying elsewhere in the city, it's easy to get here since the restaurant is only about 200 metres northeast of Bilbao metro station. I chose the ""Jack Burger"", which came with lettuce, tomato, Monterrey Jack cheese, bacon, and a special Bourbon sauce. The sauce was slightly sweetish and complemented the other ingredients wonderfully. The burgers come in 4 size options: 160g, 250g, 350g and an even bigger one. They even ask how you want the meat done: I asked for ""medium well"" and it came out absolutely perfect, with crispy bacon on top. Here's the interesting thing. You can order a ""ternera"" (beef) or ""buey"" (ox) patty. Buey costs about 20% more then ternera. So I ordered ox, just to give it a try. I don't think I can tell the difference. This is not the only place that makes this distinction. I have seen it at several other restaurants too, and reading between the lines, ""buey"" is considered a selling point. It seems to matter to the Spanish. The burger came with a small bucket of fries. Pricing was also reasonable.",2018-03-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3599952-Reviews-or30-Steak_Burger_Luchana-Madrid.html,UID_21761,0.0,0.896,0.104,0.9822,0.2757369614512471,0.5819727891156463,0.1797333333333333,1395,127,0.0910394265232975,0,57,False,46,0.1176470588235294,0.1764705882352941,0.4117647058823529,0.0588235294117647,0.1176470588235294,0.0,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0588235294117647,0.0,260,174,4.369230769230769,0,0,tri maintain bell curv rate trip advisor rate point give place review often mean except steakburg one rare one visit luchana branch stay area touristi part madrid stay elsewher citi easi get sinc restaur metr northeast bilbao metro station chose jack burger came lettuc tomato monterrey jack chees bacon special bourbon sauc sauc slightli sweetish complement ingredi wonder burger come size option g g g even bigger one even ask want meat done ask medium well came absolut perfect crispi bacon top interest thing order ternera beef buey ox patti buey cost ternera order ox give tri think tell differ place make distinct seen sever restaur read line buey consid sell point seem matter spanish burger came small bucket fri price also reason,average review,3,Spanish

Looking around, it seemed like many patrons were also there because of tripadvisor reviews. We didn't see many locals. Overall, I was slightly disappointed with the food because I was really excited after reading all the fantastic reviews. The dessert saved the meal though! The bad: We tried the fried prawns and calamari, as well as a fish (main dish. can't remember what it was called). The dishes came quickly but were not hot, so I reckon they were cooked beforehand. They were too salty and did not taste very nice at all.  The good: While the mushroom risotto also showed up lukewarm, it was flavourful and rather tasty. We had 2 desserts - the berry cheesecake and the mango mousse. Both were amazing! The cheesecake is one of the best I've ever tasted. Not too dense nor light, and the berry sauce on top was the perfect mix of tartness and sweet. The mango mousse was a dessert-of-the-day, and also disappeared very quickly.

Most us had risotto as a main course -one with wild mushrooms and one with beef and peppers, both of which were superb and so rich that we hadn t room for pudding . The proprietor was charming - attentive and apologetic for a delay in serving our starters, which we were so busy chatting we hadn t noticed. I would certainly go there again next time I m in Madrid",2014-10-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or370-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_21778,0.036,0.78,0.184,0.9865,0.3182269782913165,0.6143977591036415,0.3147499999999999,847,82,0.0968122786304604,3,19,False,31,0.0833333333333333,0.0833333333333333,0.2916666666666667,0.0416666666666666,0.125,0.0833333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.125,0.0833333333333333,165,116,4.13939393939394,0,0,look somewher group us stumbl across place far hotel paseo del prado small restaur proprietor said could fit us earli pm open madrid food terrif start us share salad rocket goat chees walnut brochett prawn squid even two squid hater group persuad tri said absolut delici us risotto main cours one wild mushroom one beef pepper superb rich room pud proprietor charm attent apologet delay serv starter busi chat notic would certainli go next time madrid,very good review,5,Spanish

Between my husbands Spanish & my Italian skills we were able to communicate. Ordered a bottle of the house red and then ordered the shrimp & squid on skewers. Omg! So good. I would have taken a picture but I didn't want to stick out too much. The best was the risotto w/ mushrooms & truffles. Hands down terrific. And then we had the octopus w/ potatoes & guac. Why can't places in the us cook octopus like this? Talked w/ other couple on the other side. Such a friendly comfortable place. The owner Pablo was so gracious. No dessert. Too full.

The charming bar next door explained that it did not open until 9! We had a drink, and back again at about 9.10, and the restaurant was already full, with only our table waiting for us. Superb food, with special mention for (1). the scrambled eggs and mixed mushrooms, the eggs simply binding the enormous portion of mushrooms to form a delicious rich porridge , and (2.) the Avila steak - perfect, tender, delicious. There was no wine list available - some printing issue - and we were asked what kind of wine we liked, and they would choose something appropriate. They did, and it was!

Welcome to Taberna El Sur, an out-of-the-way gem with great atmosphere, wonderful staff and even better food! Thanks to TripAdvisor, we found out about El Sur and walked there after the obligatory visit to the indoor market at San Miguel (There is a reason why it is something everyone does, by the way. Make sure you find out too!)  El Sur is a small restaurant filled with mostly locals. While we waited 10 minutes for a table to open up we enjoyed a glass of wine, munched on some olives and watched the staff interact with the customers. It was obvious they knew most of them. Once seated, we treated ourselves to a Mediterranean Salad (perfect oil & balsamic vinegar dressing!) while we waited for the Cuban take on a shredded flank steak, which was amazing (as were the fresh potato chips.). Alex, one of the great waiters, told us that the cook had worked in Cuba and brought the recipe with him. It may be just one of the small plates you order but it alone is worth the trip. We didn't stop there...a slice of Red Velvet cake ended a perfect meal in Madrid.   I love finding outstanding local restaurants, and Taberna El Sur is the perfect example; the locals love it, the people are friendly and want you to have a good time, and the food is outstanding! I wholeheartedly encourage you to see for yourself what the locals know already.

Much to my dismay, quite a few places in the neighborhood don't speak English, so when I stumbled upon El Sur, it was a complete God send. Jasmine immediately made me feel like family. I am vegetarian, so she replace the options on the lunch menu of the day with vegetarian options that she thought I'd love. She was right, everything I ate was amazing, service was top notch. She even made me a delicious summer drink and wrote down the ingredients for me which included one very special ingredient- ""lot's of love"". The next day prior to my evening flight, I decided to go out of my way to trek back to the neighborhood just to enjoy one last meal. I had a dish with eggs the previous day so Jasmine insisted she'd make me something different this time. The second meal was rice and sautéed veggies. They were seasoned perfectly and the meal was very filling. Both days I had tiramisu for dessert but there are an assortment of other options to choose from. If you find yourself in this neighborhood, do yourself and your stomach a favor and please visit El Sur. If you aren't in the neighborhood it is a couple blocks way from the Anton Martin metro and is well worth the trip! Thank you Jasmine, and the gentleman that was working there who's name I didn't catch. You left a positive lasting impression on me and I am grateful for your hospitality during my visit to Madrid.",2015-09-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2330-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_21817,0.011,0.835,0.154,0.9905,0.2110936955764542,0.3599280987212021,0.3665,1525,143,0.0937704918032786,1,34,False,59,0.2340425531914893,0.1063829787234042,0.4042553191489361,0.0638297872340425,0.0638297872340425,0.0212765957446808,0.0212765957446808,0.0212765957446808,0.0425531914893617,0.0212765957446808,282,175,4.411347517730497,0,0,stay airbnb apart minut walk anton martin place determin find decent st meal arriv much dismay quit place neighborhood speak english stumbl upon el sur complet god send jasmin immedi made feel like famili vegetarian replac option lunch menu day vegetarian option thought love right everyth ate amaz servic top notch even made delici summer drink wrote ingredi includ one special ingredi lot love next day prior even flight decid go way trek back neighborhood enjoy one last meal dish egg previou day jasmin insist make someth differ time second meal rice saut ed veggi season perfectli meal fill day tiramisu dessert assort option choos find neighborhood stomach favor pleas visit el sur neighborhood coupl block way anton martin metro well worth trip thank jasmin gentleman work name catch left posit last impress grate hospit visit madrid,good review,4,Spanish

The best paella was the one served at this restaurant. In particular the Black Paella. The other restaurants had Paella that tasted like if it came out of a grocery's 3-minute meal box. Everything that I ordered in Puerta de Atocha tasted like cooked by my grandmother. The other thing that was a winner was the Mojito and the deserts. I highly recommend this restaurant for people that loves food. The waiters are also an important part of my family's good time at this place. In Spain is not customary to tip the waiters, and as such, they sometimes are rude. But the crew at Puerta de Atocha was extremely nice to me and my family; from acting as our photograph to taking orders out of the menu from my sons. Overall, money well spent at this restaurant. Prices are low considering the service and the quality of the food served.

We have been there around 20:00 and been given a very small table on condition that we would leave before 22:00 which was ok for us. Our table was the last available one in the restaurant, so those coming after us had to leave for another restaurant. First of all, La Tragantua has a very nice and friendly owner/manager, called Pablo. In addition to the waiters, he is taking care of all the tables himself and dealing with you personally. But the place is very very small. It has just a few tables, squeezed to serve more people. It also looks popular among tourists since most of the guests were tourists like us when we were there. Me and my friend have tried steak and local beer. Though we would also order salad, the table was so small that it did not have room for it. I do not remember what type of steaks we have ordered but we liked our dishes. The steaks were juicy and delicious. There was only one bothering issue for both of us. I have ordered medium but my steak was rare (almost bleeding) and my friend has ordered well done and ended-up with medium steak. Last but not least, the prices were average for this type of restaurant but above tapas restaurants. Steaks were between 20-25 Euros if I remember correctly and we paid around 60-65 Euros for our dinner (2 steaks, 2 beers, 1 bottle of water). Though the place was very crowded and small, service was fast; staff was polite and friendly and food was good. Thus, La Tragantua is among the places I would recommend. Just keep in mind that steak is less grilled than you order, so beware of a rare one!",2016-08-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or160-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_3205,0.016,0.854,0.13,0.9912,0.1608333333333333,0.5029166666666667,0.4644888888888888,1705,159,0.0932551319648093,1,42,False,79,0.0983606557377049,0.1475409836065573,0.1967213114754098,0.0655737704918032,0.1311475409836065,0.0163934426229508,0.0163934426229508,0.0491803278688524,0.1967213114754098,0.081967213114754,315,182,4.415873015873016,0,0,la tragantua small restaur tabl squeez almost imposs find tabl without book advanc around given small tabl condit would leav ok us tabl last avail one restaur come us leav anoth restaur first la tragantua nice friendli owner manag call pablo addit waiter take care tabl deal person place small tabl squeez serv peopl also look popular among tourist sinc guest tourist like us friend tri steak local beer though would also order salad tabl small room rememb type steak order like dish steak juici delici one bother issu us order medium steak rare almost bleed friend order well done end medium steak last least price averag type restaur tapa restaur steak euro rememb correctli paid around euro dinner steak beer bottl water though place crowd small servic fast staff polit friendli food good thu la tragantua among place would recommend keep mind steak less grill order bewar rare one,average review,3,French

It is more bar than restaurant, very friendly - our waiter Alex, asked to be mentioned in my review after he asked me how we'd found them - and filled with more locals than tourists. The restaurant tables are in the back. What I didn't glean from the reviews is that the menu is somewhat limited. My wife had a meditaranian salad and I had ham and eggs, which they served over fried potatoes. They do give a basket of bread and don't charge for it which some of the better restaurants seem to do for their rolls. The couple next to us shared an egg dish and croquettes to begin and then had a pork dish to finish. The pork looked good but I had had a similar dish at another restaurant the night before and found the sauce odd and thefore avoided it. The drinks are good here and I had a margarita and though they say they understand English, I had asked for no salt on the rim but got it anyway. We did see others having cake desserts but we passed on that.  If you are looking for a moderately priced and local kind of place, I'd give this a try. But if you are really hungry and want a broad menu, go somewhere else.",2015-10-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2320-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_21884,0.041,0.896,0.063,0.5538,0.2106318284889713,0.3855725623582766,0.3084818181818181,1201,124,0.1032472939217318,0,24,False,56,0.1333333333333333,0.2,0.2333333333333333,0.1,0.2,0.0333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0666666666666666,0.0333333333333333,233,155,4.15450643776824,0,0,went live place last night read trip advisor review bar restaur friendli waiter alex ask mention review ask found fill local tourist restaur tabl back glean review menu somewhat limit wife meditaranian salad ham egg serv fri potato give basket bread charg better restaur seem roll coupl next us share egg dish croquett begin pork dish finish pork look good similar dish anoth restaur night found sauc odd thefor avoid drink good margarita though say understand english ask salt rim got anyway see other cake dessert pass look moder price local kind place give tri realli hungri want broad menu go somewher els,good review,4,Spanish

We got to the restaurant around noon probably and there were only a few other folks eating at the same time so it was not busy at all. As other reviewers have stated it is very family friendly and is reasonably priced. While my wife and I ate, my 3 year old daughter played matchbox cars and trucks with I believe the owner's 4 year old daughter. They both had a great time. The food was very good and was served fairly quickly after ordering. After having a beer with lunch I decided to try a gin and tonic. What a great choice! It was the best gin and tonic I ever had and is quite large. The bartender did a lot of work to prepare the drink by putting lemongrass in it and also shaving the lime. The waitress poured the gin right at the table into the glass. I probably should have had another one. I believe the gin and tonic was 5 or 6 euros which I thought was quite reasonable.

After trying it out, I can understand why. It's a small place, with limited seating, but has a lovely warm atmosphere. We were there early for lunch (by Madrid standards - at about 1.30pm), so the wait at the bar was only about 15 mins. The food is excellent - we had an eclectic mix of salads, the famous spanish omelette with potato, croquetas, paella and the ropa vieja. The ropa vieja is a cuban style shredded beef and it was delicious. We also saw lots of people ordering the pulpo (the octopus) which looked fantastic as well. Oh well, next time... I highly recommend this place - both for the food, and the fantastic service. Although they were extremely busy, Jhoan and Frank were friendly and good humoured and really attentive. I have eaten at some places in Madrid where the food is good, but the service is barely civil. It is not like this in Taberna El Sur, which makes it such a find in Madrid.

This place seriously deserves all the stars it can get! The food is so incredibly rich and flavorful that it left me wanting for more even though I couldn’t fit anymore in. We ordered the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala. The Butter Chicken was so incredibly amazing. It was cooked to perfection. The spice level I asked for was perfect. The Chicken Tikka Masala was also very good. My husband wouldn’t stop complementing it. The garlic naan was probably the BEST garlic naan I’ve ever had. It was huge!! The texture was soft and very fresh. It went so well with dipping it in our chicken entrees.  The service was very good as well. We appreciated the waiter letting us know the garlic naan was big when we asked for two initially. He recommended to start with one and that was a very good advice! We couldn’t have finished two.  Also, shout out to the owner. He was very attentive and kind to us. If we ever come back to Madrid again, this will be my first go to spot each time!

One of the primary reasons I came to Spain was to indulge in the famous ""Tapas"" as much as possible. I have a passion for food, in particular flavour and I love the Spanish culture. I particulalrly like to try neighbourhood restaurants where the locals hang out and Taberna el Sur seemed to fit the bill. From the moment my wife and I wer greeted by the barmen and the skillful way he made our cocktails in a busy and bustling albeit predominantly westerner filled resutaruant (I put my prejudices aside) to being led to our table it was great - but thats where it ended.

The guy behind the counter was really friendly, but the main reason we chose here was just because the prices weren't bad and it was open late.  The sandwiches were all premade at this time, but this meant we could be on our way faster I guess. Unfortunately, the option was solely Iberico Jamon, with no option to add some cheese to it. The ham was tasty, though the bread a little stale after having been out all day: a little tough to chew and hard that it hurt your gum in places.

Very convenient to the museums and to where we were staying. We tried 3 sharing dishes for our lunch (for 2 people) plus some lovely wine and had such a great experience we decided to come back for dinner. All in all, we tried almost every item on the menu! The menu does change seasonally so you might not find what we found when you visit, but you can be certain that whatever they are preparing will be fresh, beautifully prepared, and delicious. Standouts on our trip: cheese platter, Iberian ham, burrata with tapenade, cod, a beautiful tomato salad with tropical fruits, passionfruit dessert, and the amazing sherry.

Even though its so small its managed superbly, you don't feel the the other diners are intruding on your space & the food - well what can I say magnificent, both my wife & I rate it as one of the best we've eaten at.

I ended up in Steak Burger near my hotel.  I liked many things about it. You're able to choose the size of your hamburger meat, there was a choice of beef or ox, a choice of buns, but most importantly, they cook the burger to your desired doneness. I like my meat rare and that's exactly what I got. I would recommend the Las Pampas Burger, which had caramelized onions, chimichurri sauce and mayonnaise as well as some cheese. A well-made burger cost at least $10 in the states and this is about what it costs here.

I have lived in Madrid for over 22 years and always loved traveling to the UK or Southern Spain to get a taste of an authentic Indian dish because I never found this in Madrid. I discovered Everest about 2 years ago and am open to finding a better gem in Madrid, however, I have tried about 90% of Indian restaurants listed in Trip Advisor (all of the top rated) and Everest is in another league. Parking is difficult in this area but I normally find a spot in less than 5 minutes. My favorite plates are: Butter Chicken, Jalfrezi, Bhuna, and the Momos. The cheese naan is always fresh and moist. The staff is great and the kitchen is fast. This is not a luxurious restaurant but the quality is amazing with authentic new flavors I didn’t know existed forcing me to crave this stuff every week. It would be great if they had a better wine selection but the amazing food puts this restaurant apart from the rest.

We went there for lunch at 1:30 pm. There were only 2 tables occupied when we got there but within 5-10 minutes of being seated, the whole place became packed. I made the reservation through www,thefork.com which entitles one to get a 30% discount if you order a main course plus either an appetizer OR dessert. If you order off the set menu of the day selection, these do not qualify for the discount.  I ordered from the menu of the day choices while my wife ordered from the a la carte menu. The menu of the day includes an appetizer, a main course, dessert and a drink (soda, beer, wine, or water) all for 13 euros! That's a great deal in my opinion. I ordered risotto for my starter and chicken stew for my main course. My wife ordered a spinach salad followed by a mushroom risotto for her main course. The food was yummy. The risotto was very rich, creamy and tasty. My wife's spinach salad was simply delicious. The chicken stew was good. You can't beat their menu of the day in terms of quality, price and value. The service was so-so because there were 2 servers for the whole place and they were busy. The owner came in to introduce himself and to make sure everything was OK. I thought that was a nice gesture and the clients certainly appreciated this.  This restaurant is near the Prado and Reina Sofia Museums. It is definitely a good place to go for either lunch or dinner.",2015-02-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or340-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_22086,0.0,0.838,0.162,0.9949,0.2657196969696969,0.6107323232323233,0.26995,1491,129,0.0865191146881287,1,42,False,81,0.125,0.1875,0.375,0.09375,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.03125,0.0,278,166,4.359712230215828,0,0,place small tabl max make sure make reserv otherwis may get meal went lunch pm tabl occupi got within minut seat whole place becam pack made reserv www thefork com entitl one get discount order main cours plu either appet dessert order set menu day select qualifi discount order menu day choic wife order la cart menu menu day includ appet main cours dessert drink soda beer wine water euro great deal opinion order risotto starter chicken stew main cours wife order spinach salad follow mushroom risotto main cours food yummi risotto rich creami tasti wife spinach salad simpli delici chicken stew good beat menu day term qualiti price valu servic server whole place busi owner came introduc make sure everyth ok thought nice gestur client certainli appreci restaur near prado reina sofia museum definit good place go either lunch dinner,average review,3,Italian

The place has a great atmosphere, with Mexican music in the background. We ordered some quesadillas and tacos to share, and we had mixed feelings about it.  The quesadillas, although basic with ham and cheese, were pretty good, especially with the hot sauce.  We were expecting the tacos to be hard shell, but they were in fact soft shell. To be fair, that wasn’t specified in the menu, but it would have helped. The pork and lamb tacos were really good, but the mint sauce was quite bad, it almost tasted like toothpaste.  The high point of that lunch was the hot sauce which made everything better. I would return to the place for some quick bites and a few cervezas.

Steak was a big plain slab with too few potatoes. My partner and others around us had to send back their food for recooking as it was underdone. Plates were too big to conveniently fit on the tables.

It's a little hidden, away from the tourist area, although it is frequented by both tourists and locals. I had read many of the reviews here, and I have to add to the great comments. I was helped right away by the server, Alex, who was very nice. He was very attentive, and gave me options for my wine, to which I asked him to surprise me. He always came by to ask how things were. I ordered a half portion of the croquetas. They were delicious! I also ordered a full order of the squid (chipirones a la plancha). This was so delicious. Best squid I've tasted!

We even hesitated to go in as we already had mexican tapas the night before - but damn I'm glad we entered eventually.  The place is small, almost tiny - 12 seats if I remember correctly. We were a group of 4, so we were lucky that another party was about to leave. The decoration is minimalistic, clean and not like the usual mexican restaurant.  The place is also pretty new and run by 2 mexican gentlemen, you can see that they really put a lot of effort & heart in it. The food was excellent, homemade Nachos and everything fresh & super tasty, TOP quality and not overpriced.  Authentic mexican menu and some interesting cocktails - try the Ojo Rojo if you're brave. But what made the evening really outstanding for us was the excellent service. The older waiter was really attentive and charming and communicated with us in both english & spanish. My personal highlight was when I asked if I could keep the empy beer bottle (I collect beer bottles from all around the world). Not only did he wash it for me, he then even gave me a bag with 3 more different bottles that I could add to my collection. Actually not a big deal, but just that extra bit of great service that not everyone would think of.Oh Yeah, and the round of Tequila on the house didn't hurt either.",2016-01-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8133293-Reviews-or160-Tacos_Tapas-Madrid.html,UID_22120,0.027,0.727,0.245,0.9978,0.2596103896103897,0.5175108225108226,0.3564083333333332,1433,120,0.0837404047452896,0,36,False,60,0.0491803278688524,0.180327868852459,0.3114754098360656,0.0491803278688524,0.1475409836065573,0.0491803278688524,0.0327868852459016,0.0163934426229508,0.0983606557377049,0.0655737704918032,266,180,4.379699248120301,0,0,stumbl across restaur look dinner place la latina known tripadvisor probabl would notic even hesit go alreadi mexican tapa night damn glad enter eventu place small almost tini seat rememb correctli group lucki anoth parti leav decor minimalist clean like usual mexican restaur place also pretti new run mexican gentlemen see realli put lot effort heart food excel homemad nacho everyth fresh super tasti top qualiti overpr authent mexican menu interest cocktail tri ojo rojo brave made even realli outstand us excel servic older waiter realli attent charm commun us english spanish person highlight ask could keep empi beer bottl collect beer bottl around world wash even gave bag differ bottl could add collect actual big deal extra bit great servic everyon would think oh yeah round tequila hous hurt either,very good review,5,Mexican

The food is consistently fantastic across the board - just like they serve back in Mexico. Tacos are around 3.00 / 3.50 a piece and worth every penny. As I'm writing this, the restaurant is ranked as Madrid's second best and I would say that's a pretty fair assessment. The owner even ended the evening with a free shot of tequila on the house.

He walked us through the menu, and we ended up up going with the tasting which was paired with a great bottle of wine. He allowed us to order more of any dish we wanted - which we did! The peppers wrapped in jamon, the goat cheese salad, the risotto....all done very well. We also ended up buying a couple bottles of the wine we drank during dinner.

The owner and his partner were very nice and gave great hospitality.  Right, food! We ordered guacamole and chicken fajita. The guacamole was superb! My mouth was full of the taste and aroma of onion and avocado. It was smooth; you could swallow it without hesitation. The spicy sauce that accompanied it made you feel even hungrier. Chicken fajita was good too although, in my opinion, the guacamole was better. Very delicious.  We had the guavas in red wine sauce to close. We have never tasted such a dessert before! I won't ""drink"" the syrup sauce for any of the desserts except this one. It was just too good to describe. The guavas were soaked with the red wine sauce and the flavor went all the way inside. A dessert that was not ""sweet"" to Spanish standard, I guess, and full of flavor of red wine. We just couldn't let it stop. We ordered the 2nd and the last dessert on the list, which was a gelatin in vanilla (like panna cotta). Good but not as amazing as the guavas. Anyhow, we were more than satisfied with the dishes.  More to say, the owner treated us two glasses of tequila. A heaven way to finish the meal.

The attention they pay to each table is warm yet unobtrusive, such is the pride they have in hosting guests. This is what strikes you upon arrival. We had a reservation for opening time at 9pm and when we arrived at 855pm, there were already two tables seated and ready to order. Once more, eating at 9pm is a real challenge for us folk used to having dinner much earlier. The restaurant seats at most 30 and was fully booked for the evening, so best make reservations ahead of time.  We had no trouble finding the place as it is right across the Prado, sandwiched between plaza Plateria de Martinez and calle Gobernador. If you're coming from the Prado, use the traffic crossing at plaza Murillo, which is located right between the Prado and the Real Jardin Botanico. You'll find plaza Plateria de Martinez after crossing the road. Walk up and make a left onto calle Alameda. Calle de la Veronica will be on your right; walk to the top of this street and La Tragantua is on your left. All this is just a 7 minute walk. There is a Carrefour Express at the square at calle Alameda/Veronica/Gobernador. Pardon the loooooong preamble. Here goes the food review. We had the prawn and squid skewers for starters and they were fussfree, yummy warm-ups. The prawns and squid are lightly battered and fried. The prawns have a bite to them while the squid is tender. This all goes with their garlic alioli. Our mains were the truffle ravioli and medium rare filet Mignon. The truffle ravioli was good without the taste being overwhelming. We've always found truffle makes everything delicious but can also be too much of a good thing. The serving might be a little small for a big man. Which is where the filet Mignon comes in. This is a thick cut of very tender beef, seared nicely on both sides, served with whole roasted onions and roasted potatos. The serving is truly a handful/big mouthful, and is good for sharing. If anything, we would have wanted it cooked a little longer. The steak is thick and the insides could be a little rare for some. It was overall a very good dish for us. The star for us though was the cheesecake: this homemade sweet is pure bliss. The cranberry sauce on top is a wonderful sweet addition as are the crunchy digestive biscuits crumbs tossed around the cake. But nothing detracts from the cheesecake itself. It is a must-have! There is a tasting menu as well that other reviewers have mentioned. Do ask to see the courses before deciding on your meal. They start at 35.50 euro per person and include many items.  Service is wonderful as aforementioned and dishes come out relatively quickly. We had Daniel attend to us all evening and the man is warm and genuine. His recommendation of tinto de verano con limon was spot on (red wine and lemon juice haha, we had to make it sound classy and local didn't we!) At the end of it all, we were given a 10% discount for booking online, something we forgot about but thrown in honestly by Pablo. Total cost including 3 huge glasses of drinks was 58 Euros. A very wonderful evening.",2015-04-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1222048-Reviews-or320-Restaurante_La_Malontina-Madrid.html,UID_22159,0.009,0.84,0.151,0.9981,0.3038095238095237,0.5339346246973365,0.3218024390243902,3113,263,0.0844844201734661,2,73,False,86,0.1523809523809524,0.1714285714285714,0.2761904761904762,0.0857142857142857,0.1904761904761904,0.0095238095238095,0.019047619047619,0.019047619047619,0.0666666666666666,0.0095238095238095,561,342,4.547237076648841,0,0,far qualiti servic goe la tragantua get high mark attent pay tabl warm yet unobtrus pride host guest strike upon arriv reserv open time pm arriv pm alreadi two tabl seat readi order eat pm real challeng us folk use dinner much earlier restaur seat fulli book even best make reserv ahead time troubl find place right across prado sandwich plaza plateria de martinez call gobernador come prado use traffic cross plaza murillo locat right prado real jardin botanico find plaza plateria de martinez cross road walk make left onto call alameda call de la veronica right walk top street la tragantua left minut walk carrefour express squar call alameda veronica gobernador pardon loooooong preambl goe food review prawn squid skewer starter fussfre yummi warm up prawn squid lightli batter fri prawn bite squid tender goe garlic alioli main truffl ravioli medium rare filet mignon truffl ravioli good without tast overwhelm alway found truffl make everyth delici also much good thing serv might littl small big man filet mignon come thick cut tender beef sear nice side serv whole roast onion roast potato serv truli hand big mouth good share anyth would want cook littl longer steak thick insid could littl rare overal good dish us star us though cheesecak homemad sweet pure bliss cranberri sauc top wonder sweet addit crunchi digest biscuit crumb toss around cake noth detract cheesecak must tast menu well review mention ask see cours decid meal start euro per person includ mani item servic wonder aforement dish come rel quickli daniel attend us even man warm genuin recommend tinto de verano con limon spot red wine lemon juic haha make sound classi local end given discount book onlin someth forgot thrown honestli pablo total cost includ huge glass drink euro wonder even,good review,4,Italian

Trust me, dining here you will feel very well looked after. It's a cosy little place so it's impressive that they achieve so much in the space - reservations would seem to be essential. We had a table booked at 9pm and by 9:30 the place was full, with people being turned away on the door. The ambiance and fixtures made for a really relaxed, welcoming atmosphere throughout.  You can dine a la carte but we went for one of the sample menus, around E45 for what turned into about 7 courses, including wine, so superb value. The team really put an effort into making it a 'dining experience', each course is like a little show-stealer with some great ideas and twists using great ingredients. The only thing I wasn't blown away by was the beef, perhaps because I was envious of the main course choice of the guy at the table next to me.  All in all a definite must-do for a great night out.

This fits the bill in every way: bright yet intimate, the menu (in Spanish and English) is on the short side but comprehensive with a good choice of fish dishes. We booked through the website as space is limited. Food quality is high - well cooked and presented with good sized portions: we were conscious of a pride in the way our meal was prepared and served. The short wine list made for an easy choice, and wine is available by the glass. The sharing of dishes is not a problem, and positively encouraged when appetites are limited. One small downside is that vegetarian choice was not very much in evidence. Highly recommended if you are looking for a relaxed and informal setting, with cooking that demonstrates creative touches and leaves you very satisfied, all at a very acceptable price.",2018-11-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10077266-Reviews-or70-The_Spanish_Farm-Madrid.html,UID_22177,0.045,0.676,0.279,0.9938,0.1979330336330336,0.4599339327339327,0.8469714285714286,926,73,0.0788336933045356,0,19,False,39,0.12,0.14,0.3,0.06,0.1,0.06,0.0,0.02,0.12,0.08,162,114,4.722222222222222,0,0,although near three major art galleri dearth small friendli restaur eastern side paseo del prado fit bill everi way bright yet intim menu spanish english short side comprehens good choic fish dish book websit space limit food qualiti high well cook present good size portion consciou pride way meal prepar serv short wine list made easi choic wine avail glass share dish problem posit encourag appetit limit one small downsid vegetarian choic much evid highli recommend look relax inform set cook demonstr creativ touch leav satisfi accept price,good review,4,Spanish

It has everything going for it -- high quality food, a lovely ambiance, terrific staff and a location near both the Prado Museum and the Royal Botanical Gardens. I ducked out of the Prado to come here for lunch and it took me less than three minutes on foot along the street at the back of the museum.  I was greeted by a man who spoke excellent English and appeared to be the owner of the restaurant. He made me feel incredibly welcome throughout my stay and even adjusted the air conditioning when he noticed how wilted I was when I entered from the outside heat and humidity. As no one was dining then (1:30 p.m.), he allowed me to pick any table that I wanted.  The Iberic salad (13 E) that I chose came nicely presented and included tasty Spanish ham and seasonal fruit. In summer, this was delicious pomegranate. The portion was huge but still manageable. I enjoyed attentive service by an extremely pleasant woman. I highly recommend The Spanish Farm to those who want a lunch break when visiting the Prado. The museum ticket allows leaving and returning throughout the day, but get a hand stamped before departure.

We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant and can't recommend it highly enough!",2016-08-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10077266-Reviews-or190-The_Spanish_Farm-Madrid.html,UID_22185,0.053,0.821,0.126,0.8507,0.3465909090909091,0.6876262626262627,0.67254,524,50,0.0954198473282442,2,11,False,26,0.0,0.2105263157894736,0.3157894736842105,0.1052631578947368,0.2105263157894736,0.0,0.0,0.0526315789473684,0.0526315789473684,0.0526315789473684,99,80,4.303030303030303,0,0,saw trip advisor visit prado museum head lunch blown away food venu servic pedro wonder host went menu explain everi littl detail dish chose incred delici sangria die open month sure abl open outsid tabl place take wonder experi restaur recommend highli enough,very good review,5,Spanish

It is a tiny, modern place and it was full of Brits when we arrived at 3pm (reserve a table) but by 4 pm we were with spanish clientele. The waiter was excellent and guided us skilfully through the menus advising on unknown wines and bringing three bottles to sample before we made a choice. He also dissuaded us from ordering too much and we had an excellent and filling meal by sharing a plate of anchovies followed by salmorejo for my husband and tiny beans and jamon for me. That left room for a dessert and am I glad! I was restricted in choice because I am gluten intolerant. I went for the berry soup with coconut ice cream and had to spend the next five minutes with eyes closed as the experience was so magical.
