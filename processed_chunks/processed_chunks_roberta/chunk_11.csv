When we got to the door, the lady who was seating people was super friendly and told us there would be a little wait and that we could write down our name and come back in 15 minutes. So we got a drink nearby and when we came back she recognized us straight away and led us to our table which was really nice!  All the staff was really nice to us and the vibe in the restaurant was so fun. The service was really great at this restaurant, a lot better than most other restaurants in Madrid. The people who work here give you the vibe that they really enjoy working here which really makes eating there very pleasant. The food was really good! The presentation was so fun and the taste was really good. I tried a lot of new things and there was not one thing that we order that I did not like, which was really surprising for me since I am a pretty picky eater. I would highly recommend the octopus and as a desert definitely get the caramelized thing (don’t remember the name but it was amazing!)

The setting is elegant without being pretentious. But the star of the show is the food. They start you off with ""Galacian Bread,"" which is a whole grain wheat and rye bread that has a crusty shell and fresh doughy interior. We had fried artichokes as an appetizer - wow. Not greasy, breaded perfectly and served on a flavorful sauce (sorry, I don´t remember what the sauce was made of). We each had fish entrees, both of which were mild white fish cooked and dressed to perfection. We topped off the meal with dessert. The Saint Honoree cake was exquisite.

Sure the atmosphere was exclusive and the service was impressive, the food was actually not. We had leak with herring and a poached egg with veggies and truffle to start, it sounded better than it tasted with the leak just being a joke for €23. The mains were the hake, or star of the house, which was undercooked and just to simple to be called a star. The sauce and veggies with it didn't help. The fried veal with mashed potatoes was tasteless and crunchy and I cant recommend to order that. The desserts looked better than they tasted. Come to think of it the only things i liked where the bread and wine, which is an insult to this restaurant as it has far better things to offer. It just didn't come out at our table.  This places buzzes with corporate and embassy employees and an occasional Spanish celebrity. Its a high quality high standard place with almost impeccable service. This place has a lot going for it, location, service, atmosphere, professional to the core, great looking kitchen, but food wise we were disappointed. There are a lot of restaurants in Madrid with less service, less professional, less atmosphere where the food is a whole lot better. And less pricy as well. 3 course dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine and water at €150 is for the quality of food we had was overpriced.

We made a reservation about 2 hours prior and I'm glad we did ... although I will say the hostess was doing a pretty good job of accommodating walk-ups. We don't speak Spanish which, along with the very positive reviews, factored into our decision ... and it couldn't have been better. Our server (Laura) was fantastic ... fluent English and when I mentioned my son was limited on the kinds of food he will eat, she immediately had spot-on recommendations (even guessing correctly that he would prefer regular fries over sweet potato fries). My wife and I shared the chicken and vegetables Paella ... delicious! We also shared a liter of sangria which accompanied the meal and the warm temperatures perfectly. So ... if you're like us (non-Spanish speakers, want to try authentic and great tasting food, and want some help navigating the menu and coming up with the right choices) then this is the place for you.

Okay on arrival you are met by 2 lovely girls and as Madrid is such a diverse city they should be able to command more than one language as in KL, Saigon and London, the front of house at all other establishments we have visited were in uniforms, trainers and jeans does not set a good concept ( just go to the restaurant chain De Maria and see what I mean). Sam took us to our table of which there were 8 of us immediately it was like being in the Atletico Madrid Stadium the Spanish with us did not grab the concept and they were shouting at each other seriously its more quite in SOL on a Saturday afternoon, unfortunately this was not quietened by the staff as in all other establishments with this concept I have frequented obviously people are nervous and talk loud to compensate initially but the waiters tell them to calm down and talk quite, I felt sorry for Sam as every time he came over he had to tell them to be quite while he explained but as soon as he had gone the noise level escalated again.  The food in the other concepts I have visited had each dish in a separate little plate but here it was all mucked in together apart from the first course and then one small plate along with a big plate for each other course and the dessert was a 2 dish course and something else I will not spoil it. The wine was not of good quality the other establishments let you chose your wine before entering for 30 euros I expected a fairly decent bottle not vinegar. I will attend this concept again but sadly never in Madrid.

Unlike in KL and London, this was an all-hands-on-plate experience, although silverware was available. I found that I preferred eating with my hands (of course, each guest had her/his own plate), because I could better explore the shape and texture of the food. Our delightful waiter was charming and made funny conversation when he served us. And, as always, the food was tasty, fresh, and well-prepared. During the ""reveal"" in the lighted lounge after the meal, we were told that the chef designs the menu around seasonal favorites.  I don't understand why the idea of eating ""blind"" scares people.

If you don't know the place you won't find it as there no or hardly any other restaurants in the direct neighbourhood. The restaurant has a Michelin star and I now understand why. The food is delicious, looks fantastic and there is something to choose. There is a good list of starters and five or six dishes for both fish and meat. The three of us took three different fish dishes and all three of them where very good. The see bass with port sauce was really spectacular, I can recommend this one. Together with a sound Albarino from the also good wine list, a perfect base for a nice dinner. Personnel is friendly, modest and professional, dishes were efficiently brought on the table. It didn't take too long or too short, just perfect. The interieur is a sort of modern and minimalistic but again, perfect for a good business dinner or to celebrate whatever occasion. Ask for a table in the center of the restaurant and beware, the restaurant opens at only at 20.30. From 21.00 on the visitors arrive and 21.30 it starts to have a very good atmosphere.

However the same night, after eating the burger, I hit the bars. I had a couple of drinks and got a little bit drunk but not excessive. When I was on my way back home I already felt kind of sick. I had to throw up, but I didn't blame the burger for it in that moment. I thought it was because of the alcohol I drank at the bar; it seemed odd to me since I drank alcohol a much higher quantities before without throwing up. However, the next day my friend sent me a text, that he also felt sick that same night had to throw up as well. This can not be just a coincidence. It's pretty obvious to me that the burgers were responsible for us feeling sick that night and not the alcohol. I am not saying that the place is bad, however you should keep in mind that there is a potential risk of feeling sick after eating here, especially if you have a few drinks later that night. We might just have been unlucky on that day, who knows, however I probably won't come back again ",2016-04-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5827906-Reviews-or230-Steak_Burger_Fuencarral-Madrid.html,UID_10319,0.116,0.784,0.1,-0.848,-0.0725503663003662,0.545970695970696,0.5958272727272728,1137,120,0.1055408970976253,0,26,False,38,0.072463768115942,0.0869565217391304,0.1159420289855072,0.0434782608695652,0.1159420289855072,0.0869565217391304,0.1304347826086956,0.072463768115942,0.1594202898550724,0.1159420289855072,222,137,4.121621621621622,0,0,went wednesday even friend order gram bbq burger burger actual tast great enjoy atmospher restaur howev night eat burger hit bar coupl drink got littl bit drunk excess way back home alreadi felt kind sick throw blame burger moment thought alcohol drank bar seem odd sinc drank alcohol much higher quantiti without throw howev next day friend sent text also felt sick night throw well coincid pretti obviou burger respons us feel sick night alcohol say place bad howev keep mind potenti risk feel sick eat especi drink later night might unlucki day know howev probabl come back,average review,3

I’m from NYC So It made me feel right at home. Our server Margot was super nice and friendly. She definitely helped in choosing what we ordered. Margot whom I believe is the manager(what the back of her polo said)commanded the room, took charge of her tables in a respectful manner, didn’t rush us to order nor rush us to pay and leave. Sweet woman.

For the starter we had the baby scallops coated with prawn tempura nuggets: the scallopes were amazingly pan fried and the crispy coating gave a good crunchy contrast with the soft scallops.

The wine selection is great and must admit that the food quality is very high 8 out of 10, however, the service was VERY slow. We asked for the menus several times to take a look at the selection before the main host took our order, however, we had to wait for him to give us the menus which took around 15-20 extra minutes as he was busy at other tables, unfortunately. This was a definite bottleneck. We could have reviewed everything on the menu and made up our minds saving 20 minutes which were valuable as we only had 2 hours. In terms of food, the gambon tartare was excellent and the croquetas were also very good but there was another long wait for the steak tartar (cold dish). They brought them out to a nearby serving station and then back to the kitchen for some reason probably to wait for the hot dish. This formal synchronization of finding out ordered what and bringing out all 4 plates from the serving table to our table cost them another 10 minute unnecessary delay. I also had to ask for extra hot sauce 3 times before they brought it. This is very basic stuff and I had to wait about 10 minutes more as the rest of the table finished down their meals while I waited and before even starting. The dessert and coffee were in line with our expectations and the price paid. Basically, 237 euros later, I went home thinking that they could definitely make some basic improvements. In my opinion, they make a special effort to give a formal touch but sacrifice basic needs or listening to the customer for the money paid. They need more waiters if they want to add the formal touch and maintain a high quality aligned with the price tag. I don´t mind paying money if I get excellence but didn´t find it today.",2014-07-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6161596-Reviews-or90-Restaurante_Alabaster-Madrid.html,UID_578,0.013,0.903,0.083,0.9702,0.0961694828469022,0.479779057859703,0.3746999999999999,1770,157,0.0887005649717514,0,27,False,74,0.1403508771929824,0.1403508771929824,0.2807017543859649,0.0526315789473684,0.1228070175438596,0.087719298245614,0.0350877192982456,0.0175438596491228,0.1052631578947368,0.0175438596491228,329,192,4.382978723404255,0,0,busi lunch today custom wine select great must admit food qualiti high howev servic slow ask menu sever time take look select main host took order howev wait give us menu took around extra minut busi tabl unfortun definit bottleneck could review everyth menu made mind save minut valuabl hour term food gambon tartar excel croqueta also good anoth long wait steak tartar cold dish brought nearbi serv station back kitchen reason probabl wait hot dish formal synchron find order bring plate serv tabl tabl cost anoth minut unnecessari delay also ask extra hot sauc time brought basic stuff wait minut rest tabl finish meal wait even start dessert coffe line expect price paid basic euro later went home think could definit make basic improv opinion make special effort give formal touch sacrific basic need listen custom money paid need waiter want add formal touch maintain high qualiti align price tag mind pay money get excel find today,average review,3

We came across it by accident having gone to the nearby Mercado St Miguel which proved to be jam packed on Saturday lunchtime . Amicis was just round the back with some welcome shady outside tables on a very hot day. The food was fabulous . Four of us shared a platter of meats cheese mushroom pate aubergines and a delicious tapenade and followed with the pear and goats cheese salad with fresh figs. WOWH! The house wine was great value for money and two bottles later we were very chilled. The restaurant is owned by Maria and Alex and has been open for only two weeks. They were really interested in our views and were very chatty and friendly. We returned for dinner the following evening and had glazed salmon with seafood cous cous, steak with foie and duck. Food was outstanding. This is a real gem of a restaurant, the location is superb, the food was outstanding and the decor was modern light and airy but with some interesting exposed older brickwork. We loved everything about it. It's very new and the owners are very engaging and open to feedback and determined to build a successful business which will appeal to both locals and tourists.

Joan and I were exploring a different part of Madrid when we found that Casa Jacinto [CJ] was just opening on an early Sunday afternoon. It seems we interrupted the staff meal but were welcomed cordially and pleasantly nonetheless. We were seated at a lovely table for two. Joan had an eggplant tapas that looked and tasted delicious. I had heard that Casa Jacinto had the best Cocido Madrileno in Madrid and was not disappointed--a tasty broth and an array of simmered meats and vegetables done just right, the way a Cocido Madrileno should be prepared. A very good lunch at an out-of-the-way neighborhood place. BTW, we were directed to CJ by a very friendly policeman guarding the Spanish Senate building which is nearby.

I had my reservations as I'm a celiac and I found it very disconcerting to learn that I was going to be served a meal that I could not see. However the owner Maité put me quite at ease explaining that my menu was being prepared separately. The waiter would know who I was and every precaution would be taken to make sure I felt confident that I was eating a gluten-free meal. I relaxed and went into the dining hall with my colleagues in line like we used to do in infants school. We were seated and as our eyes got used to being in the darkness the rest of our senses began to kick in. We were served a delicious three course meal which truly tested our taste buds. Until this day I had not realized just how much I rely on seeing what I am eating to decide whether I like it or not. Today, without realizing it, I ate mussels and enjoyed them.

Vegetarian, lactose intolerant, nut and egg allergies), but as soon as I sat down and the food was served all the restrictions were met and everything was perfect. It was amazing listening and using my other senses to understand how the waiters work. Walking into the eating part of the restaurant was nerve racking because it slowly got darker until the point where it was all dark. My waiter, Jordy helped us get there and find our seats and throughout the night he remembered our names and our orders and it was very impressive. I was trying my best to make his job easier even though I had a ton of trouble finding my seat and cups and plates. You do not order your own food in this restaurant so it's basically a guessing game and you have to figure out what your eating and where it is on your plate by using your hands. I would 10/10 recommend this restaurant and in the future and I would love to go back. Being able to sit at dinner and not being able to see the people right next to me was really different and difficult and now I know how hard it is for people who have lost their sight to get around. I could barely exit the restaurant without running into the wall, so I'm not sure how people who are blind do it everyday.

The decor is like a renovated old style building with exposed brick and brushed woods. I had a mediterranean sharing plate full of delicious things. Great meats, olives, cheese, an amazing baked aubergine tapas plus generous portions of bread, and some tangy olive tapenades. I also tried a bowl of herby, peppery, olive oily cous-cous that was super tasty. For me this was all washed down with a couple of beers. I tried both the taps, a dark beer and a lager. They have this cool beer delivery system there with enormous static barrels of beer. It tastes lovely! I am pretty interested in beer so Fabio kindly explained the system to me.

Ambiance is very pleasant too so my grade for this place is 9/10.,2016-11-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5827906-Reviews-or210-Steak_Burger_Fuencarral-Madrid.html,UID_10404,0.03,0.765,0.205,0.9323,0.6422222222222222,0.6666666666666666,0.3267833333333333,364,34,0.0934065934065934,0,8,False,15,0.1739130434782608,0.1739130434782608,0.2608695652173913,0.217391304347826,0.1739130434782608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,67,52,4.447761194029851,0,0,look good hamburg place accident saw steakburg fuencarr street overcrowd decid tri realli good choic food tasti servic good hamburg amaz side dish type salad potato ambianc pleasant grade place,good review,4

One of my favourite cities in the world and I never thought it could get any better until I came across Amicis, looking for supper with a small group of friends in October. We were immediately wowed by the very cool, trendy and welcoming interiors and the lovely, Maria, the restaurant’s English born co-owner and host. Sitting outside on the terrace we were immediately made to feel at home by Fabio, Amicis’ other owner, who was one of the friendliest and interesting hosts I’ve ever come across. He spoke passionately about the food and wine and helped us choose a selection of dishes to pick at which is exactly what we were after. We loved absolutely everything but some dishes that stuck in my mind were the pear, goats cheese and fig salad, the roasted vegetable platter, a mixed meat and cheese platter and then to finish, a taste from home- apple crumble! We loved it so much we went back for breakfast the next morning where I had Huevos rancheros, a dish I hadn’t had since studying in Mexico many moons ago. Delicious!

For starters we shared the Steak Tartar, a generous portion, and a perfect fusion of flavours. I now am craving this whilst writing this review. We both had a fish dish for Mains, both dishes beautifully presented and again an interest blend of flavours. My partner rarely eats fish but was attracted to the Monkfish for its combination of elements (of which I now must try at home!) and is now a convert. I had the confit of which was cooked perfectly, it practically melts in your mouth! The desserts, Tiramisu and Apple crumble - both a perfect sized portion and again so so delicious!! If the food didn't already sound perfect, add the personable warmth and attentive nature of Fabio and you have one perfect evening! Fabio took the time to not only make suggestions for food and wines but to take interest in us as a customer.  People are always quick to complain of a bad experience, but rarely take time time to rave about the good ones so this one needs to be shared and visited.  I am so glad we chose Amicis that evening as you helped provide the perfect end to our momentous trip, so thank-you to all the team!

The reviews were excellent and we thought we must give this restaurant a go. Warmly greeted and settled outside on the terrace, we successfully ordered our first round of drinks, and unfortunately that is where it ended. We had to constantly get the waitresses attention to order food and more beverages, we even had to remind her that we had ordered additional items. When the food arrived, it was excellent, especially the ox tail croquettes with froie gras. Upon completion, we asked for the bill, and again received nothing having to ask a second time after waiting around 15 mins since originally asking. I would recommend this restaurant for food, but perhaps ask yourself how much time you have as you will be there a while.

First of all, it's a beautiful restaurant--sleek, sophisticated but comfortable. Our server was super attentive, professional, and very friendly. But let's get to the food. We live in the US but the family is my husband's and live locally and they did the ordering of lots of small plates of typical Galician food and also the wine. Well, the plates were absolutely beautifully presented and, more importantly, so delicious! We had several different seafood plates--I have no idea what many of them were but they were all incredibly delicious. The dishes were served one at a time--the seafood, including calamari and all sorts of fish, each prepared differently, were served first. Then the plates were changed and the meats were served, again beautifully presented and delicious. One of the dishes was steak tartare, which rivaled the French version as one of the best. The desserts were also wonderful. One was a type of Napoleon and the other was a cake and fruit dessert. One of the wines we had was one of the best reds I've ever had. We were there from 9 pm until 1 am and had a wonderful time. In all, I would come back in a heartbeat!

Our waitress Claudia was incredible, making great recommendations and promptly bringing out each course of food. We ordered the traditional paella and it was incredible - more than enough food for two people.

The food was good, but not the best in a neighbourhood characterised by abundance of good restaurants (ie the tuna tartare is nice but there are better options just 5 minutes away). The ambience is welcoming and the decor is beautiful (special mention to the menus) but the service is just too slow. We had to wait for more than 30 minutes before somebody bothered to ask if we wanted to drink anything. Secondly, once they came, they almost left without taking the full order of drinks (?). We were surprised that some of the staff spoke as if they had inhaled Helium. So it felt in the end like it was kind of half-fulfilled promise.

We had wanted to eat at one of two or three other restaurants nearby that we had eaten at on our last trip. Alas, they had no room to sit outside, and it was a hot night. After wasting some time walking around, hoping seats would open up, we ended up here. They had A/C inside and room to sit down. We ordered wine and water and expected to get a tapa of some sort along with those items. Nothing came. We found that unusual. We ordered a few tapas, none of which stood out as particularly memorable when measured against our 17 days of eating in Barcelona, Cordoba, Ronda, and Granada.

Current residents of Miami, we have both lived in and travelled around quite a bit and we eat out several times a week. We’re not easy to please or impress.  That being said, we both agreed that at this unpretentious but tastefully styled little restaurant, we received one of the best customer service we’ve enjoyed in our lives. This is not a hyperbolic statement and if you read any of my other reviews, you’ll see for yourself that I am particularly demanding (I have an undergrad in hospitality and a passion for excellent service). As soon as we sat down, delicious large olives were placed at our table. A basket full of freshly-baked artisanal bread was served while we waited for our food, which came incredibly quick. We ate wayyy too much, but it was worth it. We started off with the tomato avocado salad and the burrata-stuffed tomato. I would recommend one tomato dish (especially if you wish to try several dishes) but they were both scrumptious and fresh. Then we followed with a morcilla nigiri, very original. We also tried the butterfish, wish was smooth, tender and yummy! Food is enough to make this place worthwhile but the service was beyond exceptional. Tables are not assigned to one server, every staff member who walked by our table made sure our wine glass was full for the duration of our lunch (until we finished our bottle), it was truly astonishing, almost hilarious how we would take a sip and have one of the waiters fill up our glass within minutes.  The decor is brilliant: cozy, earthy, modern and edgy but respecting the surrounding feel of the neighborhood. Writing on my phone makes it a bit difficult to elaborate but I would go on and on about this place. If you’re visiting Chueca, definitely eat here. Ah! And we were the only tourist-looking couple at the place, by the conversations I could tell this is a local joint, which is always nice.

We booked a table at 9 for four people. As soon as we sat down the waitor immediately wanted to know what we wanted to drink and seemed to be in a little hurry. After having ordered our food it was like we were on a high speed train. As soon as we put down our forks the waitors rushed to our tables to take away the plates even when they were not empty yet. That disturbed us. Everything went into a rush. What should have been a nice cozy dinner, it was my sisters wedding anniversary, ended up in eating as fast as you could. Not a very nice experience.

The reluctant greeting from the Maitre'd as we walked in spot on time for our reservation came as a shock after the overwhelming friendliness experienced elsewhere; situation saved by a friendly waitress who acknowledged our booking and gave us a good table. Basil Fawlty was at his most distainfull when we ordered a wine he clearly didn't approve of and he wasn't brimmy with bonhommie or helpfullness in taking our order; his fawning over regular customers provided an element of cabaret. The food was innovative, good but not the best we've had and some dishes grossly overpriced for the content.  Basil insisted we ordered dessert with the main meal; a practice that is reasonable for dishes requiring elaborate &/or timeconsuming preparation but certainly not for most items on the list.

The place is light and spacious and it feels welcoming and friendly. The menu is short. Spanish with a, minor, oriental twist, that does not detract from the overall effect. We shared four dishes that could not be faulted. The cazon (cubes of marinated fish deep-fried) served with black garlic mayonnaise was the star, closely followed by the rabo de toro with parmesan cheese and a delicious tarta fina de manzana (thin apple tart).

We selected Amicis from the reviews on Trip Advisor and reserved a table. We were warmly greeted by the owners Maria and Fabio. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation, while the ladies cruised the Mercado the guys sampled the local beer at the bar until our table was ready. The menu has a very nice selection of food choices. The guys shared the following: a meat board, a cheese board and a cheeseburger and fries. These items were plentiful and very good with two thumbs up on the fries and the selection of cheeses. The ladies ordered a house salad with chicken and a pear and baked goat cheese salad. They were very happy with their selections and the food quality and presentation was excellent.  We were particularity impressed with Fabio and Maria’s interaction with their customers. I believe this approach serves them well. In addition to the earlier local brew I also thought the wine selections by the glass were very good and reasonably priced. I enjoyed my red wine selection. The ladies were so impressed they returned another day for lunch.

As with many (most) Madrid restaurants, the service was slow due in part to inadequate staffing (one waiter working the entire restaurant). The burgers were good though unspectacular.

My girlfriend ordered her burger well done but it was a medium at best and hers came with a wilted salad. And to top it off, we ordered a fruit shake, which can be more accurately described as crushed ice with sugar syrup.  As I write this, this restaurant is #100 in Madrid - laughable.

It is great that they offer reservations, and they were helpful and accommodating when we needed to add a chair to our table last minute. Cocktails are delicious, recommend any of the mojitos and at least getting one of the Rainbow Bagged cocktails to try just for how fun they are (but sweet!). We ordered lots of tapas for the table, they even offer 'Super Tapas' for larger groups which was great. We also got the huge Ribeye steak that was enough for our group of 7 to eat, and the Surf and Turf Paella was amazing!

Because of our chosen eating style, which makes us feel great, finding a great spot to eat is challenging at the best of time.  Our search amongst the many many fabulous restaurants in the heart of Madrid took some time. The friendly hostess (see picture) at the outside of the wonderful cheerful looking restaurant Rosi La Loca greeted us and assured us that our eating style would be taken care of.  We were then served by an enthusiastic Santiago (see picture), who was very helpful in going through the menu to wade through what we could eat, and which menu items could be modified. Santiago went back to the kitchen to double check. We were very grateful that he cared so much.  Spanish wine is perfect. We ordered the red wine without specifying what kind. Santiago brought us a bottle that was produced in his home town, and talked about the wine and it's qualities. We loved the taste of the wine. The background of the wine made it special.  We settled on the Mixed Salad with mango and goat cheese. They put the cheese on a separate plate as Jill is allergic to dairy. The salad was so wonderful. The cheese was so delicious (the fact that I just admitted now).  The second dish was the Spanish Omelette, which we had not experienced yet. It was so savory, so delicate.  The third dish was the Octopus Tentacle with a celeriac sauce. Great presentation and flavour. Rosi La Loca was the highlight of the many fabulous restaurants we dined at.  Thank you Santiago for making the experience truly memorable!!!

It was the right choice. Not only was the food good, but the actual location is great. We were seated quickly and they served all 11 of us in this nice looking (lots of open windows, well decorated) burger restaurant. I highly recommend the classic margarita and the Pampa burger.

They gave us automatically English menus and when we were ordering, it wasn't possible to communicate with the waiter in English. Before I even had time to respond that ok I can speak Spanish, the waiter picked up another person, who was able to take our order. When I was trying to ask about the wines, the waiter just asked us if we wanted red or white wine. He didn't even listen to my question about the winelist and we ended up with a really bad glass of red wine that we didn't want to order. Then when we got our beefs, my husband's beef was very gummy, chewy and the half of it was like a hard film that he couldn't eat. Mine was almost well-done, though I asked it medium-rare. When the lady with a manager-print in her shirt came to ask how was the food and we explained that we were't happy about it, she just responded us that ""well, it is beef tenderloin"". Well exactly! And that's what we're paying for and what we get is a gray piece of a shoe that no one would enjoy eating. Also the fries were hard mini mini pieces of shredded potatoes and the salad was pathetic. I wouldn't even call tose two lazy leaves and a piece of tomato a salad. Anyway, they didn't make it up or be even sorry about it. We will never step again into that restaurant.

We went for dinner our first night in Madrid which was the first night of our honeymoon. I made a simple note that it was our honeymoon on my reservation and they were so amazingly sweet. They greatest us like they had been waiting all year for us to arrive. They put a beautiful pink rose in our table for us, which was such a warm and thoughtful gesture.  The food and wine were incredible. We the oxtail tapas that was sooooo good! The codfish my wife had was the best of her life and I have pork with a red wine sauce and sweet potatoes purée that tasted just as incredible as it looked.  We had a cocktail after dinner both of which were delicious as well. My wife left it to the staff to select her drink and they came back with a winner in taste and name. I mean nothing better than your new wife having a “Spanish pornstar” befor you head back to your apartment on your honeymoon...

Huge in fact.  Does it warrant it? Hard to say as I’ve not eaten in every restaurant in Madrid.  What I can say is it gets a 5* rating from me.  The food is amazing, the salmon on seafood couscous is so delicate but packed full of flavour, the cheeseboard just great with a bottle of Rioja.  The atmosphere is relaxed, and mixed from couples to families enjoying good food together. Good ambience and an amazing music soundtrack to accompany your dining experience.  The team at Amicis just click. We felt like we had been invited to dinner at a friends place. This is what makes the team and experience at Amicis stand out.

I had a 160g burger with a side 'salad'. The problem is this restaurant chain has a bad selection of burger sizes. The smallest is 160g followed by 250g - for me the former is too small but the latter to big, where as most burger restaurants I've been to here offer a 200g size which is perfect. The meat itself was nice but the shape was more of a ball of meat than a classic patty. The next issue I had was the side dish that comes with the meal - I chose a 'salad', which was literally just coleslaw, rather disappointing if you expect salad. Though if you are someone who likes chips or backed potato these are also side options included in the price. My burger and salad came in at €8.50, which was a bit steep for the size and side I got - though if you are someone who likes extras on the burger like cheeses, caramelised onions, guacamole etc. then this might be for you as it costs the same to have a plain burger (like I did) or one with the maximum amount of extras. The next size burger up (250g) sets you back €10.50 I think.

On both occasions we were welcomed so warmly and honestly it was hard to believe we were actually in a city centre bar/eatery. The owners have made it part of their mission to speak , yes , speak to their clients which a lot of places sometimes forget . Ok, it must be tough being in the hospitality business in the city , just look around at the amount of competition, and trying to please everyone ; the bane of their lives , but hey ; it’s why most people go out - to enjoy, communicate and interact .  Such time spent goes a long way and by the reaction of other reviewers ; time much appreciated. A lovely chic , modern place with food to match . Nothing pretentious and very reasonably priced . All in all - what more can you ask for? Situated in a lively and nice part of the city , next to the uber fashionable Mercado San Miguel , Amicis is well worth seeking out for a drink or meal. Tough it out guys and keep up the good work.

Seriously delicious- I've never had a bad dish here and he exclaimed it was the best meal of his trip (we were also in Barcelona and Granada). Non spanish speakers be warned- although one of the waiters speaks some English don't expect a fully english interaction. Bring your spanish reference book or look at their menu online so you know what's what on the menu. (They do have a menu in English but I don't believe the order of dishes completely matches up) A table next to us ordered the tripe and when it came out they claimed they wanted the lambchops- very different things- the waiter handled it wonderfully (not so much the diners) and returned with new entrees for them.  Our experience was wonderful (despite not speaking much spanish) as you can tell the staff (including the chef) really care about their customers- attentive but not hoovering, quick to refill drinks, and included an after dinner drink for free. The food is cooked to order and are quality ingredients. I disagree with the other reviewer who said it was pricey- I think they could charge more for the quality and portions.

Don't miss the octopus under a glass dome of smoke. The tuna is superb. And the pork tenderloin and the chicken wings. The sardines on a clothesline looked great too. They come out with a torch and sear them. We also had a wonderful goat cheese salad. We had four large tapas, a bottle of wine and cocktails for 2 for 50 euros! The people there are very nice and accommodating too. Reservations are probably best but we didn't have any. Really really a memorable meal all around. Palate, price and people the best.

After popping in for a drink one day, followed by a delicious lunch the next (see separate review from Kate), last night we went the whole hog and called in for dinner. As usual, Maria and Fabio together with the rest of their team were amazing hosts. We started with some fab cocktails, mine being an unusual smokey take on a Marguerita made with Mezcal while Kate had an amazing version of a pornstar martini. For dinner we started with favourites from a previous visit, burrata with tomatoes and delicious fresh pesto together with exquisite poached eggs with Parmesan, bolatas and truffle oil. For mains Kate went for a beautifully cooked fillet steak, rubbed in wasabi, which gave it a lovely kick and I had a fantastic piece of duck with poached pear and a sweet Marsala wine sauce. Wow!

Maria was such a lovely and welcoming host on our first day that we were back again the next day for lunch.  Maria recommended some lovely wine for me (Albariño) and Fabio suggested a great IPA for my partner.  On day 2 we had burrata with pesto and tomato’s, aubergine with parmesan and poached egg in parmesan with truffle oil and boletus (wild mushrooms) as our starters. All were gorgeous and would definitely recommend. Then we had the seafood paella which was stunning. For dessert I had cheesecake and my partner had a lovely chocolate coulant. Both desserts were delicious. We loved it at Amicis- fabulous service, a lovely welcome and great food. Definitely worth a visit.

The place had nice interior decor with a theme of lots of floral/bright colours. The waiter made us change our minds on our order after he recommended the cheese dish (I can't remember the name, but to describe it it was like mozzarella injected with pesto and a tomato/oil base, which you then mixed together and enjoyed with bread). It was really tasty and complimented our other hot tapas dish choices well. We also shared the grill beef steak which was cooked lovely and medium rare, although I have to admit it did taste a little bit chewy. The croquetas and aubergine in honey were also great choices. The menu isn't too large but offers lots of traditional Spanish tapas choices. The service was also good, we had an American waiter who was friendly and it showed that he wanted us to have an enjoyable experience at Rosi's.

On our first visit we reserved a table as we didn’t want to miss out on a space at this very popular restaurant, which is centrally located but in a lovely quiet square. I know that I won’t be the first reviewer to say that we were greeted very warmly by the owner Fabio, who immediately had our three children and us laughing and smiling with his friendly manner. The hostess and severs were also a lovely bunch and having visited many other restaurants in Madrid during our numerous visits to this lovely city, we found this to be a unique and very special experience. The building has been lovingly renovated, beautifully decorated and was very warm and inviting. Our drinks order was taken swiftly with lots of recommendations for my husband and I on the wine list and for our children, who each selected a delicious smoothie (six thumbs up from the kids!). When it came time to order our food were talked through the menu by our server, who pulled up a chair to do so, making sure that our picky youngest child got exactly everything that he likes for his meal; this was a lovely touch and made us feel very relaxed and at ease. My husband and I shared a tapas platter and also shared two main meals of Octopus and Sirloin steak. Each dish was delicious. The children had “the best burger ever” and a chicken salad (fussy child). Only clean plates left our table. Throughout service each server that came to our table was very smiley and attentive, and we were also visited by both Fabio and lovely Maria who both made sure that we were having the best experience (ten thumbs up this time!). My husband and I ordered Tiramasu for dessert, and had a fork fight over the last mouthful, it was that good!

The menu is definitely Italian: pizzas, pasta, starters, some meat. But it has a comfortable, homey atmosphere. A five minute walk from the Las Tablas metro station (line 10).  The food was good, I don't think we understood just how seriously they took the ""Mozzarella Bar"" concept when we ordered the ""Oven Burrata"", that was a HUGE hunk of cheese. The sampler platter had more Burrata, and there was Mozz on my pizza too. My wife had the Lobster Ravioli, which was good, but quite heavy. The wine was excellent and only 3euros a glass. Service was by the manager Julio who was attentive and friendly but not intrusive. This is an English friendly restaurant even though the staff speaks only a little... they tried and did not make us feel bad when our Spanish was not clear. Our whole bill, for two starters, two mains, bread, two coffees, three wines and two cokes was 63 euros. Very good value, and we could have gotten out for much less if we weren't celebrating and felt like stuffing our face.

On arrival they made us very welcome, brought some delicious tapas. The tomato chutney like tapas was wonderful especially when added to the Patata bravas.  The paella Valencia when it came was on an enormous platter and was delicious with a deep flavour in the rice and without the saltiness we have experienced at several other paella places in Madrid.  Do have dessert, and the apple cake is really the one we would choose again.  All In all a really welcoming place to eat, with lovely food (the fish stew some other diners had looked amazing) and finished off with a sweet digestif.  Lastly very good value compared to other places we have tried. If we were staying longer we would be back again.

When you travel with the French, a top class restaurant is an absolute must and this was a huge ‘plus’ for any culinary adventure. I return on every trip to Madrid and have recommended this beautiful restaurant to all of my colleagues: now I’ll share it with you! I have tried lots of options on the menu and have never, never, been disappointed. My favourite is the Sea Bass in maracuya butter but I have, tonight, tried the king prawns on green rice.....the bass and the prawns were the best I’ve ever eaten and a friend tried the braised pork: guess what? Yes, that was also the best meal he’d ever had. Faultless, consistent, brilliance. I have eaten in fantastic restaurants in all corners of the world but this establishment is, by far, the best. Not only is the food exquisite but the gentle, attentive, service makes the whole experience so much more than just ‘eating’. The ambiance is also gentle with the strains of Bosanova playing and a quiet, cultured and calm peace.

Bresca was nearby and we thought “you can’t go wrong with pasta.”  Pleasant ambience. Very cheerful and helpful Venezuelan waitress helped us with our wine choice.  I had the “Mia Mama” spaghetti which was very very good.  Perfectly al dente spaghetti. Great sauce.  But my wife was the clear winner with the “Genovese”  So simple but once again perfectly al dente. And a really beautiful pesto and oil sauce.  So flavourful that we would have come back the next night and the next night after that just to have the Genovese.  Alas we were leaving Madrid the next day.  But if you’re not leaving Madrid the next day and you want a break from Spanish food, come eat here.  Folks...this is really really good pasta. Just goes to show you.

It's clearly on the radar for foreign tourists, while we were there the restaurant had just 3 tables booked, Americans, a Japanese couple, and us ( Australian), there were no local Spanish diners to be seen. Why that would be the case we don't know, but we are always suspicious of places where the locals don't eat. However, it was a pretty good experience despite that, nothing great to be fair, but still nothing to complain about. Our waiter helped us out by suggesting, through sign language, that we wouldn't need to order two entrée meals as well as a main each as the entree's are large, that was helpful and appreciated. The menu was, for us, slightly confusing, we normally would order an entrée and a main each with perhaps a side salad depending on the restaurant, La Tena has a menu, like many Spanish places, where if you order a salad, it's actually a full sized main course meal, thus we ordered just an entrée and a main each, leaving out the salad, in hindsight we should have gone with a salad, the mains were a good size but with no fresh light salad to compliment it we thought it lacked a little. That was our fault though and if a return visit was on the cards we would go with shared entrée, shared salad and main each. The wine list is quite small, made smaller by the many wines crossed out as unavailable, also we would have normally had a glass of white with entrée followed by a shared bottle of red, there did not seem to be any wines by the glass so we stuck with a bottle of very nice Spanish Sauvignon Blanc, but for me, my main needed a red wine and with no options by the glass we skipped the red. Our mains of confit duck and a turbot dish with a citrus foam (foam! didn't we leave foams behind 10 years ago) were both ok, but nothing special to be fair. The dessert was actually not very good at all, a deconstructed (didn't we leave that idea behind as well) cheesecake served in one of those jam jars that I know we did leave behind some years ago. Another thing that struck us was the restaurant was pretty much empty, ok, it was only 10pm when we were eating and perhaps the locals were still on their way, but they had the three full tables all jammed together in one corner which was somewhat claustrophobic and in a quiet environment when you can hear every little eve-dropping conversation we would have liked to be a bit more spread out. Add in the hour or so each way travel and we think we would have been better off staying in town and hunting down a contemporary restaurant there.",2017-07-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10230420-Reviews-Restaurante_La_Tena-Madrid.html,UID_2413,0.052,0.821,0.128,0.9932,0.1314837234328759,0.4521563088512241,0.3815916666666666,2787,258,0.092572658772874,1,68,False,115,0.1204819277108433,0.108433734939759,0.2891566265060241,0.0843373493975903,0.1204819277108433,0.036144578313253,0.0,0.0240963855421686,0.1325301204819277,0.0843373493975903,524,284,4.320610687022901,0,0,look event night meal madrid toss idea citi instead decid strength tripadvisor review head la tena restaur minut metro minut walk sol clearli radar foreign tourist restaur tabl book american japanes coupl us australian local spanish diner seen would case know alway suspici place local eat howev pretti good experi despit noth great fair still noth complain waiter help us suggest sign languag need order two entr e meal well main entre larg help appreci menu us slightli confus normal would order entr e main perhap side salad depend restaur la tena menu like mani spanish place order salad actual full size main cours meal thu order entr e main leav salad hindsight gone salad main good size fresh light salad compliment thought lack littl fault though return visit card would go share entr e share salad main wine list quit small made smaller mani wine cross unavail also would normal glass white entr e follow share bottl red seem wine glass stuck bottl nice spanish sauvignon blanc main need red wine option glass skip red main confit duck turbot dish citru foam foam leav foam behind year ago ok noth special fair dessert actual good deconstruct leav idea behind well cheesecak serv one jam jar know leav behind year ago anoth thing struck us restaur pretti much empti ok pm eat perhap local still way three full tabl jam togeth one corner somewhat claustrophob quiet environ hear everi littl eve drop convers would like bit spread add hour way travel think would better stay town hunt contemporari restaur,average review,3

While the food was very good, what really stood out was the attitude of the staff and pace of the evening. It was almost as if the staff had invited us all to their NYE celebration. They were super attentive, happy and celebratory throughout the night and joined us in ringing in the new year with cava and grapes at midnight.

If you look at Amicis Facebook page, the group ‘team’ photo speaks volumes and sums things up...happy staff providing an excellent service and that ‘buzz’ in the photo is infectious! We felt it from the moment we walked it; felt part of a unique, warm & friendly evening, which was genuinely heart warming.  The most enormous & heartfelt thanks goes to Maria! From the moment I made my initial enquiry she was professional, enthusiastic, helpful and prompt in her replies and what we experienced on New Years Eve more than exceeded expectations.  Maria and team gave a warm and genuine welcome on arrival and this ‘personal touch’ continued throughout the evening; everyone was polite yet attentative and Maria made sure she spoke to us and everyone else in the restaurant several times, but was never intrusive - it was like being with a friend - she effortlessly made us feel welcome, relaxed, important and that she was genuinely interested.

The eggplant chips (dressed in honey (small order is plenty) are unique and a fabulous compliment to a glass of wine. We enjoyed the pork medallions and chicken wings, but the sardines on a clothes line, complete with our server using a torch to grill them, was a highlight of our meal.

Rosi La Loca Taberna had great reviews so made a booking about 2 weeks before our trip. We underestimated the time on foot it would take us from our hotel and what with the volume of people out and about was running late. Was looking for their number to call when they rang to see if we were on our way which I thought was a nice gesture rather than giving our table away. We was greeted warmly and shown to our table downstairs. Our friendly waiter asked if we would like some drinks and we both ordered cocktails. We was unsure how much to order and was advised about 4-5 dishes. The waiter was knowledgable and offered good recommendations. Most of the food was amazing. Can’t say I would be rushing back to try the octopus tentacle but it’s something that I’ve tried. Overall, a fantastic little restaurant which comes highly recommended and very reasonable priced.

Too bad, this platform need to give an honest image, not the image the owner wants you to post.  Very small tables (don’t move as you hurt your neigbour !). I admit, the waiting time is smaller than predicted, and for sure not 25 minutes, even with all tables occupied. Oh yes, don’t forget to make a reservation, or you may want to look for another resto.  The bad thing is the quantity of the plates: disgusting few paella, hardly enough to cover the pan’s bottom. Bring your magnifier to discover the fish, as aside from the 2 shrimps and the 2 mussels, I didn’t.  The price is more expensive than elsewhere and the quantity couldn’t be less.

We stopped quickly on this small plaza very close to Mercado de San Miguel, found a restaurant with outdoor seating to enjoy a drink in the sun, away from the hectic crowd.  Our 1h stop ended up being more than a couple of hours. We had an amazing couple next to us, started chatting and apparently they were the owners. They moved to Madrid to follow their dreams. Lovely and genuine energy. They treated us very well and the service was great!

The owners work in the restaurant, Fabio is front of house, Maria the business lady - perfect combo. The position is great, children can play in the square to the front- shade or sun and very safe. We relaxed at our outside table with ours in full view.  Service was totally on point, English and Spanish, and our waiter Miguel also very helpful and friendly. Timely service too. Attentive but not overly so, nothing too much trouble.  Both service and food is important to us and the menu did not disappoint. Think fresh, healthy but indulgent. We enjoyed salads; crispy kale with couscous and apricot. House salad was chicken and avocado lightly dressed with crisp leaves.

I reserved a table over „the Fork“. I called to confirm aswell. All went perfect. Our table was reserved at 10 PM and we got the beautiful wine celler table straight away without waiting :)  Interior design of this place is seriously amazing. So much thought was put into it. Flowers, Paintings, lamps, Flamingo party room! Just wow! We ordered: *2 Cocktails presented in such amazing art.  First cocktail: Served in a hatched layed in feathers It tasted amazing. And the flavor was a surprise! Second cocktail: Served in a Science glass and when opened smoke came out! So awesome! Another surprise :) *Beef platter: WOW best meat ever! *Tortilla: Obvi best tortilla in town, without a doubt! *Crocettes with ham inside (to drool over) *Mushroom soup- awesome topped with the Beef platter!  *Mozzerella- O M G to diiiiie for, food orgasm !!! They also own another Restaurant (see Picture) We did not have a chance to go there but recommend with 10% off.  All in all it was an amazing experience!
