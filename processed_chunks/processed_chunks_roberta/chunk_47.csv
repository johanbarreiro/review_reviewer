(Buddha bowls from Faborit were better) Then as I couldn‚Äôt wait any longer for the bill I went to the desk to pay. I got the bill and when I held my card out to pay, the host dude left me hanging and decided to tidy a few things before taking my card. Really?

Superchulo is always my backup, but it almost always ends up being better than the original plan. The place is huge and modern. There are plants (real or fake?) hanging from the ceiling and the restaurant extends downstairs and around several corners. Everything is decorated nicely and instagram-worthy.  The restaurant is entirely vegetarian (no meat at all) with lots and lots of vegan options. I love that every item on the menu tells you what allergens it contains (soy, lactose, sulfites, etc.). I also love that each item tells you if it's possible to make it vegan - for example, if you want the veggie burger to be vegan, then it tells you just to ask for it without cheese.  Most of the menu stays the same during the year, but the soups and salads are constantly changing with the season. I love that they offer a cold soup in the summers and a hot one in the winters. I also love that their salads are not the typical lettuce and tomato that you typically receive in Spain. Their salads are bowls of various vegetables, legumes, and grains.  Most recently, I came with two friends. I ordered a winter buddha bowl - the pop-eye with a garlic vegan alioli, roasted asparagus, greens, over a huge bed of black quinoa. I ordered it with tofu and roasted sweet potatoes (all for 10.50). The asparagus was a little oily but the flavors were excellent and the alioli is the best alioli I've ever had anywhere! It was a huge quantity and I took the leftovers to work for lunch the next day.  My friends ordered the flower power pizza and another winter buddha bowl - the pink one with beetroot and rice. They finished everything and agreed it was delicious. I've previously had the green bao buns. They are phenomenal. I love sticky buns. There are only two but they are quite large and extremely filling. In fact, I would have been satisfied with only one. My friend this time ordered the pad thai and enjoyed it a lot. The quantity was satisfactory for him. Especially since we had shared the mini pizzas - which are incredibly decadent and filling.  I've also had one of their large salad bowls with falafel. The salad was excellent, however, I found the falafel almost inedible. It was too dense and dry. I can't recommend any get the falafel here. It was served with their homemade crackers which are phenomenal. My friend this time had the barbacoa pizza with their fake meat. My friend enjoyed the pizza but said it was very filling and they were a little unsure about the fake meat. We also had the soup of the day which we liked a lot. Unfortunately, there are not many vegan desserts to choose from. However, I am usually too full from my meal to want dessert anyway, so it is no problem for me. The service can be a little slow, but that is typical in Spain.  In short, I can confidently recommend this place to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores. The atmosphere is relaxing and beautiful, the menu is excellent, and the prices are fair and affordable. Definitely worth more than one visit.",2018-03-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12555789-Reviews-or40-Superchulo-Madrid.html,UID_26422,0.029,0.738,0.233,0.9993,0.1985831656606304,0.6165325285043595,0.4396243902439025,3096,263,0.0849483204134367,1,90,False,105,0.048780487804878,0.2073170731707317,0.3536585365853658,0.0121951219512195,0.1829268292682926,0.024390243902439,0.024390243902439,0.024390243902439,0.0853658536585365,0.0365853658536585,554,285,4.57942238267148,0,0,visit superchulo sever time typic get tabl anywher els superchulo alway backup almost alway end better origin plan place huge modern plant real fake hang ceil restaur extend downstair around sever corner everyth decor nice instagram worthi restaur entir vegetarian meat lot lot vegan option love everi item menu tell allergen contain soy lactos sulfit etc also love item tell possibl make vegan exampl want veggi burger vegan tell ask without chees menu stay year soup salad constantli chang season love offer cold soup summer hot one winter also love salad typic lettuc tomato typic receiv spain salad bowl variou veget legum grain recent came two friend order winter buddha bowl pop eye garlic vegan alioli roast asparagu green huge bed black quinoa order tofu roast sweet potato asparagu littl oili flavor excel alioli best alioli ever anywher huge quantiti took leftov work lunch next day friend order flower power pizza anoth winter buddha bowl pink one beetroot rice finish everyth agre delici previous green bao bun phenomen love sticki bun two quit larg extrem fill fact would satisfi one friend time order pad thai enjoy lot quantiti satisfactori especi sinc share mini pizza incred decad fill also one larg salad bowl falafel salad excel howev found falafel almost ined dens dri recommend get falafel serv homemad cracker phenomen friend time barbacoa pizza fake meat friend enjoy pizza said fill littl unsur fake meat also soup day like lot unfortun mani vegan dessert choos howev usual full meal want dessert anyway problem servic littl slow typic spain short confid recommend place vegan vegetarian omnivor atmospher relax beauti menu excel price fair afford definit worth one visit,very good review,5

As we were checking the menu, we‚Äôve kindly asked for a menu in English, where a waiter just pointed on the Spanish Menu on a QR code, saying we could have a look on their website where the menu is shown in English. While checking the website, we were disappointed by just seeing pictures of how the food could look like. Food was super overpriced. The praised ‚Äúbao‚Äôs with no pulled chicken bbq (...)‚Äù turned out to be a children‚Äôs portion. The rainbow pizza was nothing really special and on a too small plate (you could barely cut it). The pasta was fine, but also nothing spectacular.  I guess, because of the reputation of green and biological street food at the moment, the demand of these various dishes are refreshing to try. However, you can not treat your guests/customers like they are not welcome and force them to order quicker or to eat faster.

The staff were very friendly and the decor of the restaurant was trendy and quirky, but we were seated at a small table for two in the front corner and I had a bare light bulb hanging 10 cm above my forehead, which was bit distracting and was unflattering for photos. It was a nice location for watching people walk past the large windows, though.  We were there at about 6:30pm, and were given the smaller Breakfast and Lunch menu; the dinner menu doesn't start until 7pm. We each had pizzas - the Margarita Presumida and the Pizza Trufada - which were tasty, but sweeter than pizzas tend to be in the UK or US. To drink, we both had the house beer, which turned out to be Heineken. Heineken's fine, but I was expecting a Spanish cerveza as the house beer.  The toilets were very interesting and quirky - the sinks were barrels with taps plumbed in above them.",2019-03-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12555789-Reviews-or20-Superchulo-Madrid.html,UID_38198,0.015,0.918,0.066,0.8532,0.1657913165266106,0.4869747899159664,0.2262285714285714,945,90,0.0952380952380952,0,23,False,27,0.1739130434782608,0.1304347826086956,0.3043478260869565,0.0,0.0434782608695652,0.0869565217391304,0.0434782608695652,0.0434782608695652,0.1304347826086956,0.0434782608695652,173,116,4.456647398843931,0,0,ate sunday even research vegetarian restaur madrid staff friendli decor restaur trendi quirki seat small tabl two front corner bare light bulb hang cm forehead bit distract unflatt photo nice locat watch peopl walk past larg window though pm given smaller breakfast lunch menu dinner menu start pm pizza margarita presumida pizza trufada tasti sweeter pizza tend uk us drink hous beer turn heineken heineken fine expect spanish cerveza hous beer toilet interest quirki sink barrel tap plumb,average review,3

He rushed us into everything. It started with ordering drinks when we barely set down, after that we had hardly any time to look at the menu to see what we wanted to eat as he was rushing us once more into ordering. When the food finally arrived and we were eating he was still hovering around waiting for us to finish and sure enough one second after we put down our forks and knifes he took our plates, even though some of us hadn't even finished their food yet. It continued by him pouring the remaining sangria from our jug into our glasses only so we would finish faster. Then suddenly he just put the bill on the table without us asking for it (and we were still drinking our drinks) and forced us to pay. After we paid he made us leave and said he needed the table.

The interior is well done with picturesque aesthetics all around. If you appreciate design, this is a good spot. #postoninsta. The only downside was the cleanliness of the restrooms, that could've used some up-keeping. 2- The service: our waiter was very attentive and gave us some great recommendations. In general, the staff did it's best even if they didn't speak English. 3- The food: the food was delightful. We had the paninis to start with, and the curry and flower pizza for our mains. The curry was definitely the star of show. The panini was flavourful and the pizza was good as well. The pizza has vegan cheese which might be an acquired taste for non-vegans out there but overall it was good. In fact, we really enjoyed the place we went back for brunch the next day. All in all, I would highly recommend the restaurant.

However, if it is, then go on. All over Spain, octopus is on the menus, but you never know what you're going to get, and it's definitely on the expensive side, so I was hesitant to spend a lot of money and not be satisfied. After looking at a lot of places, this one appealed to me, partly because it was an octopus specialty restaurant. I guessed right! The price was competitive (it's usually about 16‚Ç¨ for 'Pulpo a la Plancha', which is REALLY the one you want - that's the grilled version, not too greasy, oily, and saucy - just a light marinade to accentuate the subtle flavor of the octopus). As for the texture, it's not subtle at all, of course, but that's why you eat octopus! But, again, because this is a special place, they are serving the freshest, and highest quality, octopus available, and even the texture was quite tender (as tender as octopus can be!). But the flavor? Out of this world, and the serving was enormous; this would have been plenty for two people, no doubt, especially with the enormous whole potato (roasted without the skin) that came with it. The wait staff is very engaging, and clearly loves their product as well.

A perfect combination. :-) And this place won't let you down. It is a nice, relaxed bistro (restaurant tables seemed to be in another room in the back but not yet open to the public as we came in early). The menu includes dishes with an interesting twist; with simple and tasty seafood as a focus. We also tried the pig ears - not really our thing so we only tasted a bit.

It was a lucky choice. We were both impressed by the original ambient, by the friendly atmosphere and by the buzzing dynamic activity of the attendants. All the personnel is young and seem to really enjoy their work with cheerfulness and attentiveness. As I understand there are three ways to to have a drink and/or a meal: at the bar (sitting on stools); on common tables placed in front of of the bar or in isolated tables situated in the adjoining room. This place seems to be very popular and well frequented by both tourists and locals. After waiting some minutes to find a free place to seat on the common tables in front of the bar we chose cod croquettes and grilled octopus. Even if the place was busy the service was rather quick (compared with other spanish places) and that's important if you don't have much time. The cod croquettes were delicious and delicate (I think the best croquettes I had in Spain!) and the grilled octopus (very good) came with a superb sauce. We couldn't resist to finish it up by dipping in it the bread they brought us. Even the draft beer we had was good (above average). I think it's a good choice for good quality food (even for a quick meal).",2015-03-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3134558-Reviews-or130-La_Pulperia_de_Victoria-Madrid.html,UID_38228,0.008,0.78,0.211,0.9946,0.3551149425287356,0.5725862068965517,0.4571583333333333,1296,116,0.0895061728395061,1,33,False,57,0.1515151515151515,0.1969696969696969,0.2575757575757575,0.1212121212121212,0.1515151515151515,0.0,0.0454545454545454,0.0151515151515151,0.0454545454545454,0.0151515151515151,237,148,4.472573839662447,0,0,colleagu found place chanc walk around puerta del sol look quick lunch lucki choic impress origin ambient friendli atmospher buzz dynam activ attend personnel young seem realli enjoy work cheer attent understand three way drink meal bar sit stool common tabl place front bar isol tabl situat adjoin room place seem popular well frequent tourist local wait minut find free place seat common tabl front bar chose cod croquett grill octopu even place busi servic rather quick compar spanish place import much time cod croquett delici delic think best croquett spain grill octopu good came superb sauc resist finish dip bread brought us even draft beer good averag think good choic good qualiti food even quick meal,very good review,5

It was very very warm. The AC was on but barely working so it was suffocating. 2 Yes it's nice but nothing that that special, I have seen similar concepts in Barcelona, Brooklyn and Copenhagen.  It's like an old butchers shop reconverted into a restaurant. Is one of those places with a looong table common fir everybody.  The design is fun and interesting but they coukd have done a but better. 3. The real deal and my BIG ISSUE.  The plates are MINCE. They are tinny portions. Look it's ok, usually in Madrid food even very good food is cheap, you want to make a new interesting concept and the kind of food you make is not cheap, Fine ! My issue is that everywhere says that you eat here fir 25 euros, and it says that because that's what they pretend you to believe. The food is interesting and good. But you will have to order a lot of plates if you want to leave the place reasonable satisfied because the portions are ridiculously small. I would recommend the octopus because is really good and reasonable size. The butter fish because it was awesome and the sardines with eggplants. But to be sincere, I won't return I felt cheated is just a trendy place and that's all. Trends pass. If you want good modern cuisine try Kitchen 154 in Mercado ValleHermoso. That is so much better .

Market food made of outstanding ingredient quality plus creative take on traditional food from the whole country. And the interior is just gorgeous. Service was fine, they explained everything correctly and offered good suggestions. In a perfect world, the waiters wouldn't seem so anxious to make you order more drinks. They ask you so frequently if you want another drink that it seems like you are not supposed to be there if you don't have many beers or wines. That, together with that trendy speedy music, it kind of makes it stressful! But, this is just what happens in every trendy restaurant nowadays, rotation rules, sala Despiece isn't worst. Overall, a very satisfying experience!

I had the opportunity to visit Madrid many times before and almost all the experiences I've had there were very nice. This is not the case.  The menu has not much variety, but at least everything is vegan.  The question is what you get for what you pay. The portions are really small. From the hamburgers to the ""to share/compartir"" items. For example, I ordered ""patatas com salsas"" for 7Eur. They brought 10 slices of roasted potatoes to the table and they were already cold... In any corner in Madrid you find better than this. The hamburgers, I would classify them as nothing special... and again, small and a kind of undressed. 10Eur. I didn't see the menu before and I was expecting to have a bit more of Spanish vegan flavours, instead, they focus on hamburgers and hot dogs. Not the kind of experience I look for. But the biggest issue, the thing that really bored me, was that the staff brought the bill to the table without I have asked for it. They said they had reservations... but the place was actually empty and I didn't spot anyone around waiting... They essentially invited us to leave. Really unpleasant.  Just to finish my review. I would not recommend this place. Food is average and it is not representative of the nice spanish flavours you may find in other vegan restaurants in the city.  There are many other veg options in the neighborhood.

We are both avid foodies and just love it when we find a winner.  This place is the real deal. The owner oversees a very hard working and compitent staff and it shows with his busy restaurant.  Our meal started out with a nice wedge of Spanish Tortilla. It was thick and had nicely sliced poatoes and bits of jamon inside. If you like octopus, la pulperia's octopus is tnder, juicy and the portions are generous. Drizzled with olive oil and accompanied with a simple wedge of lemon. If you try this place, you cant miss this dish. We also ordered a plate of whole grilled squids which were also cooked perfectly. It was served with some type of aoli mayonnaise and lemon. The trick to cooking these babies are to make sure you dont over cook them, as they continue to cook even after you take them off the grill.  We had their house salad too. It had a beautiful grade of tuna flaked on top and the curly escarole and nicely ripenned tomatoes added to its tastiness. We also ordered a meat empinada. The empinada needed some work however, as it was rather tasteless, under seasoned and dry. We ended our meal by sharing their torta santiago, a simply prepare country almond tart. This was accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. All in all, we loved the meal and would go back in a heart beat.

The restaurant is really small - 8 tables perhaps, so it¬¥s a good idea to make a reservation before. It¬¥s also clearly a family-run business, so there is a very nice homey atmosphere. However, the most important is the food - surely the best vegan food I have ever eaten. In fact, I am not a vegan but I loved it so much that I could easily live without meat for the rest of my life if all restaurants were like Distrito Vegano. We shared some ""Croquetones de la Abuela"", which are without any doubt one of the fines, yummiest piece of food I have eaten for a long time. And the same can be said about the Nachos - they were beyond belief. As a piece of resistance, I had a cake with edible violets which was simply extraordinary. On top of that the service was friendly, efficient, fast, and the bill much cheaper than we expected. Highly recommended place whether you are a vegan or not.",2018-09-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10588044-Reviews-or10-Distrito_Vegano-Madrid.html,UID_38292,0.0,0.814,0.186,0.9901,0.2775955204216074,0.5494444444444445,0.3458,1063,100,0.0940733772342427,0,27,False,39,0.1707317073170731,0.1219512195121951,0.2682926829268293,0.024390243902439,0.2439024390243902,0.024390243902439,0.0,0.024390243902439,0.0975609756097561,0.024390243902439,201,140,4.293532338308458,0,0,wife vegan madrid decid visit small restaur far atocha queen sofia museum color quarter lavapi restaur realli small tabl perhap good idea make reserv also clearli famili run busi nice homey atmospher howev import food sure best vegan food ever eaten fact vegan love much could easili live without meat rest life restaur like distrito vegano share croqueton de la abuela without doubt one fine yummiest piec food eaten long time said nacho beyond belief piec resist cake edibl violet simpli extraordinari top servic friendli effici fast bill much cheaper expect highli recommend place whether vegan,very good review,5

The guy behind the bar ( manager or owner - I'm not sure - does a great job explaining all the dishes - really good at making you hungry.  We tried the tomatoes ( 2 styles ) both are delicious but ask for the one thats the whole tomato. We also ordered the tuna seared ( must order - would re order 20 times if i could) . Tried the artichokes - perfect blend of flavors. We also tried the steak tartar ( by far the best thing on the menu ). Wine is mostly Spanish in option - the white was drinkable at a normal price.

Sure , the place is rather meant as many others in the zone a tapa ' s place. But what tapas- WOW! A rather young crowd from all over the world in a funny technohousemusic like atmossphere serves the best what Spain has to offer. Fabalous seafood tapas like red prawns, langostinos. white asparagus from Navarra sort cooked and glazed with a honey like gelatine. Carpaccio with a fab fresh mayu sauce and olive truffle cream. Wrinkled potatoes from Canary Islands with elegant tops and black truffles, small golden thistles prepared as tempura. Wow fantastic. Wines by the glass or by the bottle at very fair prices per bottle. We had a white wine - yes- from Mallorca called Quibia....very good as old malloqunian grapes like Callet are just getting rediscovered now.

So, we took the decision to go there on a Saturday night. I thought okay let's go and see if too crowded, we do something else. At the door, this young lady explained us that it was full and the waiting time was minimum 1 hour and it could be more but she did not know. We said okay like all the other people around us and we were all handed a magic number. I did look at the number in detail. Was it 9 or a 6. So this young friendly lady advised all of us to go for a drink and we all took her advise and went off our own ways to find a place. After 75 minutes, well she said 1 hour, maybe more than 1 hour so 75 minutes was like between 1 and 2 hours. I thought we could maybe wait a bit there and enjoy the food! What a mistake:)So, we were all back. This young nice lady explained us that they were still full and ask our number I showed her our blue paper which said 90:)) and she told all of us that we should wait more. She did not tell us we have no choice and we should leave. She stood there and with her explanations she made us think that there was hope. As it was her job. I have to underline what she said again. She said maybe 1 hour maybe more. She did not know. Same lines again. So we all hoped for 1 hour and 5 minutes I think.  This time I refused to go somewhere and stood in front of the restaurant. Most people went back. Then this young nice lady came and told me ""look it's cold here, let me get you two in to the waiting room. That moment we looked each other with my partner with light in our eyes, with more hope, waiting room, we are getting closer. What a mistake! In that moment there were 4 Spanish customers who just came by the door.This young lady againexplained them the system in my view. Guess what, we went into the waiting too  And the waiting room is a tiny room, looks like a tiny demo teaching room and there were already in total 20 people before us :)))... We were at this point starving. We could not give up. Another nice lady there gave us drinks, ofcourse we paid for them. So I checked this waitress notes on the table and in total there were 16 -18 people before us but the system looked complicated . 1 hour later the lady outside came in to announce that in the private room(another room) there was a cancellation and if anyone would like to go there, she would arrange i. I have read about this table on their website and wanted to have a look at it. I went in and saw a huge table in a tiny very uncharming room with 8 very hungry people and empty table. I said no. Then I decided to go out and then have a look at the restaurant and understand our chances of food which at that moment I would have been happy to be served an apple or half a piece of bread. Then suddenly I saw these 4 Spanish clients inside the restaurant which came after us. When asked about it, thisyoung nice lady outside told me that I was completely wrong actually they were before us. You know she might be right. I might have completely made a mistake and I do not want to cause this nice lady her job but let me tell you what else I have seen when I went in. I saw all the 16 people from the waiting room, sitting, standing without a food. And what else , I saw a restaurant fool with people with no food in a very nice decor. There was not any place even tostand. So basically all 90 people before us were there and let me tell you: They All Looke Well, I took my dignity with me or what's is left out of it and my partner and then we left. One of the best decisions I have made to have some self respect for myself.  I can not judge the food or the food service. This young nice lady at the door told me that she has been doing this job for 6 months and she would never risk it by being unfair. At that point I thought that 6 months of experience and you can not tell if a client if they have to wait 1-2 hours or 4-6hours? But it's not her responsibility as she is following a strategy of the owners who tells her don't keep the clients in front of the restaurant, send them for a drink, if they insist then keep them in the room with no air. She is just following the orders. So, if you are clever enough to go before the restaurant opens or on a weekday, let me know how the food tastes.  Good luck!

As in Rome, Paris or many other capitals with great food, you need to know very well where you're going. Severla places gives you low cosrt and bad quality even for sophistacated cuisine and main courses you imagine so delicious.  The Puleria Victoria (pulpo means octopus) is a greta place you can spend only 20 euros with great wine (ask the Ribeiro ""vino de la casa"" and make them suggest different kinds), deserts and a great discount if you go www.eltenedor.es (we got yesterday a 30% discount). Service is great (ant this is not so common and believe me I know after 10 years in Madrid), air conditioning and a nice atmosphere. Food I suggest you the following: 1) get octopus. I attached photos below of we got. I think best is ""a la plancha"" (in the pan), not the fried one which has flour and is so heavy. They put oil and basil/rugette on it and it is very very very soft. You will love it. Then we asked the other one with shrimps (gamas). 2) Try ""pimientos del padron"" (green peppers grilled, one of 20 can be spicy). Very well done.  3) Try navajas (razor clams). Never found any sand or unpleasant sensations. This is soft, with great olive oil. The bread they had was fantastic home-made kind from Galicia.  Deserts are good and authentic as all the rest. See what we had with our friends and ask for it. Cheese and quince is the typical desert they have in Galicia and also typical in Argentina were ""Gallegos"" took it hundred years ago.

We had seen this place on Bizarre Foods and couldn't wait to try it. Luckily for us it was in walking distance from our hotel (Hesperia ).  When we walked in we thought we would either have to wait forever or eat standing up. Both of which we would have done seeing the preparation of the food and it being delivered to others. They asked if we minded being seated with others in a room next door. We didn't mind and walked over. It was very cozy and a nice setting. Even though you were sitting with other people you didn't feel like you were.  My wife and I picked out a few things we recognized and asked our waiter Josimar for some other suggestions. He did not disappoint. He spoke English pretty good and made some awesome choices for us.  The presentation and preparation are worth five stars alone!  We had the Rolex. The octopus. The shishito peppers. And some other dishes that were amazing that I cannot remember the name of. The egg yolk and foie gras wrapped in some sort of thinly sliced meat was awesome. But the best was the meal that was like Korean bbq. You can't go wrong mixing up meat and having it blow torched at the table!! Add egg and some Veggie and delicious flavor combined with lettuce wraps and you've got yourself a meal! We spent two weeks prior in Italy to this stop over in Madrid and we agreed this was one of the best meals we had. And....with three beers and three glasses of wine and a TON of food our bill was less than 100 euro! We commented that in the US this type of food and presentation would have been 3 to 4 times this price. Amazing value.  Absolutely recommended if you are in Madrid.

Then they said ok ( like they were doing me a huuuge favor) we'll give a table. The whole time i was eating half of the tables remained empty. I just dont understand why they made me wait.

The interior design, a combination of modern & traditional, makes you feels very comfortable. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was half Irish who was very keen and paying a lot of attention. While we were ordering he gave us some good recommendations.  First we (2) ordered 3 dishes which were all incredible! The various octopus dishes were so delicious that we need to order 2 more dishes even though we everything else than hungry. My recommendations are the ""pulpo a la gallega"" as well as the ""sepia a la plancha"" combined with a good bottle of Rioja! If you like Octopus, you need to go to this place!

The Turbot was a good generous portion of two fillets, both well cooked and the delicious (was the feedback). The Paella was cooked for one person (which is unusual), but still served traditionally, brought to the table and then plated up by the waiter. I had to taste it, it was lovely and not too rich.  The d√©cor is typical old Spanish, all very wood based and pictures everywhere of Galician towns etc. There was a number of Spanish families eating when we got there so that is always a good sign and the majority of them were eating seafood or fish.

Following the main meal which we could not finish we were offered our choice of dessert and coffee. We choose a crepe and ice cream and shared the 2.

But it is worth every cent. My vegetable starter, a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù peeled tomato with deep fried basil, exploded with such an amazing flavor in my mouth, never had vegetable better.

The chairs were all taken at this stage but we were directed to a free bench space and soon seen to by one of the friendly waiters. They took our drink order and provided us with some English menus, still slightly difficult to interpret but if you're happy to eat anything you'll be fine. We made a couple of choices and asked for a recommendation to which he advised the beef sirloin was the house favourite. We ordered the confit tomato, the steak tartar, the razor clams and the beef sirloin. It's actually quite hard to put into words how amazing and creative each of these dishes were, they're not fine dining but the creative touches were very cool. All were delicious. It was especially fun when the waiter comes out and cooks the beef sirloin in front of your eyes, not to mention it tastes amazing. The restaurant steadily filled up whilst we were there, and we remained standing for our meal, this in fact did not detract from the experience but instead added to it. Service was also great considering how busy they were. We then went onto have dessert, the waiter called it sweet milk flan and fresh berries. Again simple but delicious. We left happy and full and feeling like we'd been somewhere unlike anywhere else we'd been in Europe. I would definitely recommend a visit but if you need to sit to eat go on the dot of opening.

After a false start of trying to get a table without a reservation on a Friday night we were able to reserve one for Saturday and it was well worth the wait. The staff are friendly and welcoming, the restaurant busy but not crowded and the customers laid back and relaxed. As for the food, what can I say? It's the best we've tasted in Madrid so far. We decided on the tapas tasting menu for ‚Ç¨20 per person so we could sample lots of different dishes but could just have easily ordered of the main menu - everything looked so good! We got to try 6 dishes (including dessert) and there was easily enough food for two. Everything was fantastic but I have to single out the meatballs and potatoes for individual praise.

My wife and I are both vegetarian, but were keen to experience this Michelin-rated chef's fare whilst in Spain. As a more ""casual"" format, ViCool offered a more practical and less expensive way to do this as opposed to his signature resturant Sergi Arola Gastronomy. Within the limited veggie choices available, we ordered patatas bravas Arola (his take on bravas, the garlic mayo added a nice twist) and the margerita pizza (heaped with cheese and pieces of buffalo mozzarella). Both dishes were creative and beautifully plated, although portions were small. For desert, we were recommended to try the catalonian cream (which can only be best descibed as a deconstructed cookie with cream and custard) and it didn't disappoint.

As some of us didn¬¥t want to drink wine, they were very pleasant to change the wine for another two drinks by person, free as well. The menu is very complete, it has 9 dishes, from exquisite salads to chocolate with fruit. I would like to remark some dishes. The first are the ‚Äúbravas by Sergi Arola‚Äù, a delicious and new version of the traditional fried potatoes with spicy sauce. Others interesting recipes were the portobello carpaccio, jam croquettes and fried shrimps with curry and mint. As a dessert, what can be better than chocolate with seasonal fruits.

They have a list of recommendations of the day as well as the usual laminated menu. Lots of interesting fish but you need a good phrase book to read the specials as they are in Spanish only! We had white asparagus from Navarra - good but not a patch on English asparagus - followed by hake and turbot a la Gallega. Not quite sure why you would serve delicate white fish in a gloopy sauce with paprika but perhaps that's a matter for the Galicians! However, the fish was first class. Followed with cheesecake with bilberries - very light and tasty. Good wine list with an emphasis on Rias Baixas (Albari√±o) and the ma√Ætre d' suggested an excellent one.

Slight problem we noticed is that the size of the dishes doesn't increase if there are, say, six people at the table. Only the amount of different dishes increases, which comes as kind of a surprise. Service was impersonal, and although there were 3-4 waiters for a very small restaurant, they weren't around when you needed them. When I asked for a suggestion for wine, the waiter proposed the most expensive bottle on the menu, without any reason. Suggesting only that is in my eyes, very bad taste, and makes clear you are only trying to make money off the restaurant. It wasn't worth the money and half a bottle cost as much as a full bottle of great wine in nearly any other restaurant we went to in Madrid (or Spain for that matter). Aside from that, the tapas are not ordinary (in a good sense), and especially the patatas bravas were incredible. The carpaccio of portobellos with trufle was nice, but the grated cheese they used to mimic a very small amount of white truffle also masked the white truffle flavour, which dimished the value of the dish. We had to wait for one of the waiters to buy a banana to go into our desert dish (freshly cut fruit with warm chocolate to be used as fondue). This dish was kind of pathetic, 1 raspberry, 1 blackberry, more than half was apple, and one strawberry was cut into 7 pieces. As we saw this dish pass to other tables during our meal, we noticed the chocolate fondue bowls seemingly shrink with each new serving. Anyways, if you know this dish is exactly the same for a table of 6, the proportions are not correct, especially given the final price of dinner here.",2016-09-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2475639-Reviews-or90-Vi_Cool-Madrid.html,UID_36349,0.057,0.897,0.045,-0.7187,0.0986855036855036,0.5775552825552825,0.439,1719,154,0.089586969168121,0,47,False,68,0.1081081081081081,0.1351351351351351,0.2162162162162162,0.054054054054054,0.1216216216216216,0.0675675675675675,0.0405405405405405,0.0675675675675675,0.1216216216216216,0.0675675675675675,319,200,4.391849529780564,0,0,order la cart take tapa menu tapa peopl four six slight problem notic size dish increas say six peopl tabl amount differ dish increas come kind surpris servic imperson although waiter small restaur around need ask suggest wine waiter propos expens bottl menu without reason suggest eye bad tast make clear tri make money restaur worth money half bottl cost much full bottl great wine nearli restaur went madrid spain matter asid tapa ordinari good sens especi patata brava incred carpaccio portobello trufl nice grate chees use mimic small amount white truffl also mask white truffl flavour dimish valu dish wait one waiter buy banana go desert dish freshli cut fruit warm chocol use fondu dish kind pathet raspberri blackberri half appl one strawberri cut piec saw dish pass tabl meal notic chocol fondu bowl seemingli shrink new serv anyway know dish exactli tabl proport correct especi given final price dinner,very bad review,1

Vi Cool is managed by one of the most famous cheffs of Spain (Sergi Arola). The restaurant is well decorated, but the tables are too close to each other. What attracted my attention of this restaurant is the daily menu price (13‚Ç¨ without drinks), quite cheap and not common for well-know cheffs. The daily menu includes one starter, one course and a dessert or coffee, they offer you three starters and three main courses to choose one of each. All the dishes were made with dedication and perfectly presented. We would like to stand out the tuna block, which was delicious and incredibly juicy. The waiters were very pleasant.

We had a booked a table and were shown into one of the rooms at the rear, by a waiter whose attitude I can only describe as surly. I asked for a glass of Cava and was told it was only available by the bottle. After looking at the menu, we decided to order a half portion of the grilled prawns, as a starter, we were brusquely told this wasn't possible.

So to be honest, the expectations were higher then normal. Even though we can really appreciate simple but good food, this food was fresh but defenitely not anything interesting at all. Taste was not well balanced and it did not satisfy whatsoever. I ordered tapas del mar and my girlfriend wasnt hungry so she just ordered a salad. We were surprised woth the amount of food they served until we got the bill and saw that they counted 2xtapas del mar. I explained that there was a misunderstanding and i felt bad because we already ate all the food. They said you can only order it per 2 persons and we had to pay which was absurd because this rule is not in the menu, not on the board and it wasnt told by the waiter. The manager was called and he understood inmediately and took off the second tapas del mar menu from the bill. We felt bad but also it was rude how the waiters reacted. Nevertheless we decided to leave a good more then 20% tip. The waiter I gave the tip to was rude and disrepectful about it what made us regret the tip straight away.

Although the novelty of the new Lagasca hangout may have already worn off for some (seeing as there were very few people there), those that did go on that night seemed to be having an amazing time, and so did I. Although the menu is more affordable and more easily approachable than the one at the Gastro, you'll find that signature meals like Sergi's patatas bravas and sweet & sour desserts are still present. With sizes that are no longer molecular and meals that are still as delicious, you'll be excited to share this experience with good company. By contrast, the waiters are more pretentious and less efficient than those at Zurbano, making their effort at politeness appear strained and unnatural.

We booked a table for two based on the recommendations. We arrived and we were greeted fairly coldly by a waiter who asked us to wait until the table was prepared. A waitress dragged herself to the table to prepare it - quite honestly, she looked like she had the weight of the world in her shoulders. We were seated and given an explanation of the menu. We opted for the tapas set menu for 2 people. (‚Ç¨22pp)  The food was very good! A mixture of vegetarian and meat dishes. We weren't given a lot of time to enjoy each one before the next tapas arrived. Once we had eaten the savoury tapas I asked if we could have a rest before dessert. Greeted with a frown, the waiter asked if I wanted coffee or a cake?!  Service is in need of improvement. I'm sure Sergio Arola didn't intend for such a poor level of service. If you're happy to pay for good food without good service and limited atmosphere - go for it!

Try the sharing seafood platter for 2 or 4 but first start with a plate of the Galician octopus and one of the hot roasted peppers, also to be shared. The boiled ham and sausage was great too. Finish with their version of Irish Coffee but on a DIY basis i.e. they first bring a flaming dish of sugar and alcohol which you keep stirring with a ladle at the table to keep the flame alive (no Health and Safety here!) then they add the coffee and tell you to keep the ladle going for a further 5 minutes.... then drink! The most expensive wine was an Albarino at !8 Euros. We had two bottles and the bill for 4 was still only 130 Euros for a great Galician experience.",2011-09-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1373174-Reviews-or210-Marisqueria_Ribeira_do_Mino-Madrid.html,UID_38442,0.01,0.798,0.193,0.9919,0.1992283950617284,0.5549382716049382,0.4839375,967,80,0.0827300930713547,4,26,False,36,0.2142857142857142,0.1428571428571428,0.2142857142857142,0.0,0.1428571428571428,0.1428571428571428,0.0714285714285714,0.0,0.0714285714285714,0.0,182,124,4.318681318681318,0,0,impos doorway side street minim sign insid wow one place know go great room room tabl lot waiter white jacket scurri around huge plate seafood load noisi convers score diner mainli local tri share seafood platter first start plate galician octopu one hot roast pepper also share boil ham sausag great finish version irish coffe diy basi e first bring flame dish sugar alcohol keep stir ladl tabl keep flame aliv health safeti add coffe tell keep ladl go minut drink expens wine albarino euro two bottl bill still euro great galician experi,good review,4

Just as well my son called to book the day before it was heaving on a Friday night (13th May). We had the 'Mariscada para llevar' for 2 at 31e with a bottle of Albarino & 'flaming coffee' to finish. All for 63e (cash only, no cards). There were prawns galore, langoustine, crab, mussels, lobster & we couldn't finish it - the couple next to us cleared their plate & were gone well before we were done. I should have worn a bib for this - it was quite messy - they give you 2 empty plates each for the shells & replace these as required, also hand wipes keep coming - finger bowls would be need to be finger buckets. No chance of genteel table manners or any delicate nibbling here. The decor is fairly spartan but functional - table cloths are of the disposable variety. I don't normally like noisy places but it seemed appropriate here. If you have an aversion to seafood they do steaks & things but maybe you should try somewhere else. We had been up in Galicia last summer so we couldn't have hoped for anything better. The waiters were a bit off hand but helpful if required & I think this was more to do with them being so busy.

It was promising as the display of seafood and meats on the outside was impressive. It also helped that it was 3 mins from our hotel and the place looked promising. The decor and ambiance was old school, with serious waiters dressed in old world restaurant clothes. The Maitre d' was friendly enough and the service was professional. I was expecting more out of the food, though. The octopus was tender and flavorful, but at 20 Euros, should have been fantastic. a quarter kilo of langoustines was okay at 18 Euros. The 50 Euro seafood paella was disappointing - we asked for the more expensive version that should have included a ""large"" lobster but this one was probably less than the standard 1-1/4 lb. It was scrawny - even the claws did not have much meat. I would've gotten more meat from an $18 lobster roll in Jersey City. Plus - there was no other seafood in it. A definite rip-off, even though the rice itself was really good. Dessert and after dinner drinks were better than average: my wife and daughter was happy with the Souffle Alaska and something called Filloas. He poured me a generous snifter of a really good brandy that set me back E14. That was worth it. Overall an okay experience, but not a good value proposition. 145 Euros should buy you a better dinner.",2015-09-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697476-Reviews-or150-Casa_Gallega-Madrid.html,UID_37039,0.049,0.772,0.179,0.9885,0.2069940476190476,0.4357473544973544,0.4509176470588235,1365,112,0.082051282051282,0,37,False,56,0.1176470588235294,0.1764705882352941,0.3529411764705882,0.0588235294117647,0.2156862745098039,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0392156862745098,0.0196078431372549,243,162,4.621399176954733,0,0,recommend brother colleagu best galician restaur madrid promis display seafood meat outsid impress also help min hotel place look promis decor ambianc old school seriou waiter dress old world restaur cloth maitr friendli enough servic profession expect food though octopu tender flavor euro fantast quarter kilo langoustin okay euro euro seafood paella disappoint ask expens version includ larg lobster one probabl less standard lb scrawni even claw much meat would gotten meat lobster roll jersey citi plu seafood definit rip even though rice realli good dessert dinner drink better averag wife daughter happi souffl alaska someth call filloa pour gener snifter realli good brandi set back e worth overal okay experi good valu proposit euro buy better dinner,average review,3

In this case, it is Galician. A group of us went there on a Sunday night especially to eat the seafood platter. Aside from seafood you can also order regular tapas. The portions are pretty generous and the price is OK. Madrid is supposed to have some of the best seafood in the country, as it's brought in fresh from the coast every morning. But it's surprisingly hard to find somewhere that will give you the fresh stuff. This place serves abundant, fresh seafood.  If you prefer fancy restaurants, then this is not your place.

When we arrived the place was absolutely rammed - people standing outside with drinks and a slip of paper. We quickly realised that you have to find the waiter with the notepad and get yourself a number. We were told it would be about a 45 min wait, but we weren't in a rush and decided to wait at the bar. Bar is very busy with locals having tapas and drinks - we elbowed through and got a glass of wine each for about 2 euros. When I went back about 15 mins later for another, the waiter waved my cash away and gave us a free top up. We were seated after about 25 minutes. There IS a menu, but we decided just to order the mariscada (the cold mixed shellfish platter - ours was crab, langostines, shrimp and prawns) with mayonnaise and bread. LARGE amount of food - we're used to deshelling and picking shellfish - for us it's half of the fun - if you don't enjoy it, then it's probably not the place for you.... Lively fun atmosphere - we were there on a Sunday lunch, and it was full of intergenerational Spanish families. We were too full for dessert, but you get a shot of liquor on the house at the end.

The restaurant is basic, and enormous, the staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming though be warned that they don't speak English so you need a bit of basic Spanish or good improvisation skills! The seafood platter was huge. It had several spider crab sections, including four or five body shells where most of the brown meat had been removed for other dishes but there was enough left, and it was the best bit of the platter.

So when I was there at first glance, it looks serious. Everyone work on their role seriously. And then I started to feel how caring they are to their customers. It is not one of those try to impress tourists or get tip like some countries. But it is a genuine caring that even you can understand a word in Spanish, you know they care and they are kind. They are two groups of customers local who stay at the bar and tourists in the diner area. We stay at the bar because my husband have to watch world cup. I love a friendly atmosphere, real and down to earth. I had a really good time  And the food of course, the best sea food so far. We went down south but did not have seafood!

He seemed nice enough, it looked fine so we decided to go without reading any reviews. I have read some since and can't believe that they are about the same place. If you are looking for plush surroundings and prices to match this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for honest food, well prepared and served with good grace and humour then pull up a chair. The menu isn't extensive but there is enough choice, the waiters are brilliant, friendly and helpful,the food is clearly prepared by people who know what they are doing. We ordered veal heart (it isn't the actual heart but a cut close to it) iberian pork and a mixed meat plate for 2 - it could have fed a family of four for several days and it was all delicious. Very generous portions, possibly too generous, you need to take your appetite. The wine was good and the draught beer and both were reasonably priced.

The place is informal, let's say it's an evolution of the classic simple restaurant with limited amount of dishes that are typical. In Italy this would be an ""osteria"", hence don't expect high level service or environment. The place is crammed with simple tables, simple cutlery, simple everything: and it's PACKED with people. You must absolutely book if you're going for lunch on Sunday, and most likely also in the weekend in general for dinner, unless you feel pretty lucky. Unless you want to order something special, go for the seafood plate (I uploaded some images), which is a mix of different things: crabs, prawns, king crabs, and mussels of different types (some typical of Galicia). Prepare yourself to get dirty, this is not something you eat with knife and fork. Wine from the house is crap, but who cares, perhaps this is the whole point of the joint, to eat good and simple. Maybe you can end the meal with a nice warm glass of Cardinal Mendoza, a Spanish tasty and typical brandy.",2013-04-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1373174-Reviews-or180-Marisqueria_Ribeira_do_Mino-Madrid.html,UID_35741,0.025,0.857,0.118,0.9501,0.0998522167487684,0.5806896551724139,0.5629625,1071,83,0.0774976657329598,0,39,False,41,0.0930232558139534,0.1395348837209302,0.3720930232558139,0.0697674418604651,0.1395348837209302,0.0232558139534883,0.0465116279069767,0.0,0.0930232558139534,0.0232558139534883,188,131,4.702127659574468,0,0,read place tripadvisor pretti satisfi place inform let say evolut classic simpl restaur limit amount dish typic itali would osteria henc expect high level servic environ place cram simpl tabl simpl cutleri simpl everyth pack peopl must absolut book go lunch sunday like also weekend gener dinner unless feel pretti lucki unless want order someth special go seafood plate upload imag mix differ thing crab prawn king crab mussel differ type typic galicia prepar get dirti someth eat knife fork wine hous crap care perhap whole point joint eat good simpl mayb end meal nice warm glass cardin mendoza spanish tasti typic brandi,good review,4

The potatoes were a hands down winner. 9 beautiful cylinders appeared - crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside; each topped with a heavenly garlic aioli. I would return just for this dish.

Noting that this was regarded as a ""budget"" Sergio Arola restaurant, I had been impressed by its contemporary look from outside when walking along Calle Huertas (just round the corner from where I was staying) and decided one evening to give it a go. Prices are higher than average but clearly below that charged at the other upmarket Arola restaurants. My son and I both tried the classic tapas set menu which in the summer was priced at 20 Euro each. The Arola potatas bravas were very tasty and the fresh fruit with chocolate fondue was delicious. The set menu was a wonderful way to sample Arola's dishes and we were not disappointed. The restaurant was very busy which gave it a nice vibe.

I have been to this place twice within the last three months. Great seafood at affordable prices. A medley of different shellfish for 2 people (mariscada) with a bottle of Albari√±o wine will cost you around 50 euros. The second time around I felt that the mariscada was much poorer, as it did not include ‚Äúbuey del mar‚Äù or edible crab. Instead, it had many more tiny crabs and goose barnacles (cheaper than 'buey del mar'). I did complain to the server, who pretended he didn‚Äôt understand...

The freshest fish/shellfish will be listed on the daily menu supplement. We had the cocochas (hake cheeks) and a hake steak, both in ""salsa verde"" (green sauce). You can choose grilled, baked, or even battered if you prefer. The hake was the freshest I've had in years, perfectly cooked, and melt-in the mouth. Other people around us were having deliciously looking seafood soup, an entire baked besugo (red bream) and renowned Galician beef (steaks, oxtail).

Our first impression was that it was a little ""style over substance"". Our waiter was nice though and helpful in guiding us through the (Spanish) menu del dia. At 12.90 EUR for 3 courses this was great value but we were not blown away by the food by any means especially given the reputation of the owner. The food was all fine (no cause for complaint) but was quite average on the whole. The mushroom soup starter tasted great but was lukewarm. The bread that accompanied it came with tomato pulp and this was lovely. The ""salmon a la plancha"" came topped with a tiny portion of roasted vegetables (reasonable for lunch) but was also lukewarm! In addition the skin wasn't crispy which seems unusual for something cooked a la plancha. Chocolate custard/mousse dessert was a nice end to the meal.

It was early evening and the place was packed. We got a tapa with our beer and watched them preparing mariscadas for the imminent rush of evening diners. We decided to come back some time to have a proper sit down meal.  We came back on a Thursday at madrile√±o lunch time, i.e. some time between 14:30 or 15:00. Again, it was busy but we managed to get a table. We ordered a bottle of cava and went for the mariscada, an enormous pile of prawns, cray fish, langoustines, barnacles, swimming crab and crab. It was very tasty, but I was defeated about half way through. My partner slowly chomped his way through it all.  When he finally finished two hours later, the Spanish ""ladies who lunch"" sitting next to us expressed their admiration for his perseverance saying they had not expected us to finish. They on the other hand had worked their way through octopus and crabs and were now on some flabmb√© desert which looked amazing.  When we asked for the bill we were offered the traditional digestive: orujo, a pomace brandy. At that point a couple came in and asked for a table. They were told that the place was now closed and that they would reopen at 19:00. It was only then that I noticed that we and the Spanish ladies next to us were the only diners left. Across the room the waiters had sat down for their lunch. Nobody was hurrying us although it was 17:15 by now and they had officially shut for their lunch or break at 17:00.

The place itself look yak at first, especially when u r not used to the chaos and the seafood smell. But if you breaks that wall and go beyond that initial limit , you will enter in one of the most amazing experience in Madrid. The quality/cost ratio is very good considering that abroad , in the western world, the same service ( a packed marisqueria dish for one along a 75 fresh ribeira ) would cost you at least double if not more. Service is great. They r very careful that you do not fill up your paltr with seafood shells by cleaning it up and swap the plate and they do not put pressure on u once u r finished. Whether you are by yourself or alone enjoying their delicatesse.

There are rare times when the food is so flavorful, it makes you stop talking and pay attention. This is one of those places. We arrived at 8 am on a Monday and had our pick of any table in the place. We picked the one right next to the open window onto the street. Score #1. Our party of 3 decided to go with the tapas tasting menu along with a nice Rioja. Score #2. The dishes were carefully plated and the taste was crazy good. It's all we talked about as we sampled each one. Notice the ""Uncle Sam Wants You On A Harley"" sign when you walk in the door? Turns out, the owner is friends with the largest HD dealer in Spain and when you mention that you own a Harley (helps to show a pic), you get a 10% discount.  Yes, they brought the dishes rather quickly, but we stayed for 2 hours and nobody pressured us to get out. The staff were friendly and fun--maybe it's just us!

Despite the initial impression, this is an excellent choice, especially for those who like seafood. We hadn't reserved and were seated immediately as we were relatively early in the evening, although at peak times I would imagine a reservation is needed. The restaurant staff don't speak English well, but sufficient for us to be confident in our choices of food and wine. We chose the seafood platter and as the evening went on, I would say that about 90% of the customers chose the same. And no wonder. It is an excellent choice, as good as any seafood platter we have had anywhere else in Spain, France, USA etc., with about 10 different varieties of seafood in plentiful quantities for both of us.  We chose the standard house white wine and this was also very acceptable. And then when the bill came, it was a very pleasant surprise to see how reasonable it was.

Slightly off the beaten track, The Ribeira is extremely popular with locals and I'm proud to say I'm pretty sure we were the only tourists in the whole place one very busy lunchtime.  The menu can be a little confusing - what constitutes a starter and how much do you get - being a prime example. My advice is to think of everything as a main course, a hugely portioned main course at that.  Needless to say we discovered this by error and ending up eating our body weight in prawns , langoustines, shrimps and crab before our ' main' courses arrived.  The food is delicious - although all agreed that their main course fish was a little drier that we are used to in the UK.  Bonus marks for the excellent service, the unpretentious atmosphere and the very fair prices.

Are we glad we did!! The service was great and friendly and the food, yummy!! We were served an amuse bouche of chicken wings the moment we sat down. The server then patiently explained the menu to us and we decided on the daily menu - del dia - which gave us appetizer, main course, and either dessert and/or coffee. The seafood paella, an eggplant lasagna-like dish, and oxtail stew was particularly good. The portions were also very generous and prices very reasonable indeed. Highly recommended!!

We visited Vi Cool while we were in Madrid celebrating our 26th Wedding Anniversary and were so glad we chose that restaurant (the Lonely Planet write-up sounded intriguing). We went for the six-dish tapas menu, which was loosely structured as starter/main/dessert, and every single dish was fantastic whilst at the same time nothing like any ""normal"" tapas dishes we've had before. Carpaccio of Portobello Mushrooms, marinated in truffle oil and served with grated parmesan and pine nuts was just one delicious example.

Honestly though, not sure how to rate this place. Clearly we didn't think as much of it as a number of people on TripAdvisor do.  We ordered the 'especial', the seafood platter, based on the recommendations of TripAdvisor and the fact that many others were having the same in the restaurant. The platter consists of prawns, langoustines, crab (2 types) shell, legs and claws. The platter is served cold, which isn't what we were expecting. Moreover though, the flavour was quite disappointing: much of the crab was just salty in taste. Some of the crab she'll also contained no or very little meat, which was quite a disappointment.  Service was ok: staff were a little brusque, which I can understand given how busy they were, but they did their best to find us a table when we hadn't reserved.  Overall, I don't think we'd come back here again. We both love shellfish and fish in general, but the quality and taste of the platter wasn't enough in our experience to warrant a repeat visit.

The waiters are very efficient, but are rushed off their feet and can seem a bit brusque. I went with my cousin (who lives in Madrid) and when we tried to book on the day we were told we couldn't but were advised to arrive very early (by Madrid standards), between 8.30 and 9.00 pm. We got there about 8.45 pm and only a few of the many tables were still empty and the place was completely full by the time our main course (the delicious seafood platter for two) was served.. We chose the tasty octopus tapa to share as a starter, and washed our meal down with the excellent Albari√±o white wine. The seafood is messy to eat, but was really fresh and tasty - unfortunately we weren't given wet wipes though noticed that some tables were - and I ate things I hadn't tried before.  I'll certainly eat here again next time I'm in Madrid, but will probably make my own selection of dishes as I got a little bored with removing shells and picking at crab legs and claws before we'd worked our way through the enormous platter!!!",2016-06-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1373174-Reviews-or90-Marisqueria_Ribeira_do_Mino-Madrid.html,UID_29871,0.042,0.831,0.126,0.973,0.1784406231628453,0.5372957084068195,0.4963333333333333,1185,109,0.0919831223628692,4,34,False,55,0.1944444444444444,0.1388888888888889,0.3888888888888889,0.0,0.1666666666666666,0.0,0.0555555555555555,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0277777777777777,224,156,4.290178571428571,0,0,great place enjoy galician seafood best alway extrem busi somewher go look quiet place dine waiter effici rush feet seem bit brusqu went cousin live madrid tri book day told advis arriv earli madrid standard pm got pm mani tabl still empti place complet full time main cours delici seafood platter two serv chose tasti octopu tapa share starter wash meal excel albari white wine seafood messi eat realli fresh tasti unfortun given wet wipe though notic tabl ate thing tri certainli eat next time madrid probabl make select dish got littl bore remov shell pick crab leg claw work way enorm platter,good review,4

The restaurant is located in a perpendicular street to Fuencarral and it is always as crowded as people expect to be so making a reservation is essential . There is a parking just walking down the same street which it is really useful since it is completely impossible to find place in that zone. Related to the food, there are two main dishes, the seafood dish and the grilled one, which I would recommend if this food is not your cup of tea because of the taste mixed with their own sauce really tastes good, far away from the rawness of the fresh seafood.

The tables are packed tightly together, the decor very basic with bright white fluorescent lights.  But the seafood is good, simple and fresh. Most people seem to order the seafood platter, heaped with all kinds of prawns and crabs. There is no sauce on it, just a side of mayo and a chunk of bread on the side.  It was so good that we decided to visit again the following day and try the hot dishes. So if you a large group, add on a plate of pimiento (green peppers) and octopus. It is VERY good. The peppers are not spicy at all. Very flavorful and addictive! Service is very fast. The waiters are attentive, but they do not speak much english. The menu is not in english as well, but the pictures are a good guide. They may seem a little curt but it is because they are so busy. A smile will gain bigger smiles from them at the end of the meal - probably also they are pleased that we ate so much! Service is very fast - especially if you order the seafood platter.  We did not try the dessert, but from other tables we noted the desserts are very big as well.",2016-11-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1373174-Reviews-or80-Marisqueria_Ribeira_do_Mino-Madrid.html,UID_38670,0.01,0.805,0.185,0.9943,0.1729489795918367,0.4608265306122449,0.4502333333333334,1227,124,0.1010594947025264,2,33,False,48,0.1521739130434782,0.1956521739130435,0.2826086956521739,0.108695652173913,0.1956521739130435,0.0217391304347826,0.0217391304347826,0.0,0.0217391304347826,0.0,235,149,4.212765957446808,0,0,coupl step away busi call de fuencarr expect restaur expens expect big serv nonsens atmospher tabl pack tightli togeth decor basic bright white fluoresc light seafood good simpl fresh peopl seem order seafood platter heap kind prawn crab sauc side mayo chunk bread side good decid visit follow day tri hot dish larg group add plate pimiento green pepper octopu good pepper spici flavor addict servic fast waiter attent speak much english menu english well pictur good guid may seem littl curt busi smile gain bigger smile end meal probabl also pleas ate much servic fast especi order seafood platter tri dessert tabl note dessert big well,good review,4

It's not the budget option, but it's not ruinous by any means either. We had the 20‚Ç¨ menu, and the food was very good. There was meticulous attention to detail on even down to the temperature at which things were served (the aubergine was a nicely judged warm, rather than hot or cold) and texture. On a food level, I would say the chef's real knack is for balancing flavours and textures rather than the exact flavours themselves. That is to say, if you gave him two ingredients I'd bet that he'd come up with the right way to set them against or with each other. It's certainly not traditional tapas, and neither is it outlandishly clever, but it's different, well conceived and very well executed.

I am fond of Gallegan cuisine and wanted to see how it fared away from home. I was not disappointed. I ordered the ""Special Menu"" which consisted of marinated salmon salad, croquetas and a seafood paella accompanied by a half bottle of Rioja Crianza, finished off with a tarta Santiago (almond cake). The first two dishes were excellent. To be fair, my preference for Arroz Valenciana prejudiced my opinion of the paella which was delicious and about twice what any sane person should eat. I just prefer my paella a little drier. I was disappointed in the carajillo which I ordered in addition to the menu. It was not prepared in the traditional manner, and while a decent cap to a good meal, would have been a highlight had it followed the traditional recipe rather than being sugared espresso with a shot of cognac. Service was excellent and the staff were welcoming, even though I took up what could have been a table for four.

Beware that the platter is cold as the others have said. The taste was salty and fresh, just simple taste but delicious for seafood lovers! My friend thought the crab was too salty but for me it was great :) There's plenty of seafood for 2, and in the end we took the rest home. They also do take away. I don't know if it's possible, but if you're taking it away, ask if they could break the crab pincers as it can be difficult to break it without the tool (i had my fair share of shells flying around). I saw some reviews saying they have bad service, but for me the experience was nice. The waitress was fast and nice. And i'd recommend to book in advance cause they are quite full.

But this time, at this Vi Cool, we tried the menu del dia for lunch, and with 20 euros a person we had a full and very tasty meal. The problem is that the original Sergi Arola gastro restaurant is really good and expensive but worth every euro. These Vi Cool places, are not supposed to be expensive. But if you go for the normal priced dishes, then the price becomes very expensive for what is offered which is only a tasty plate of food but nothing spectacular that would explain the high prices.

The style is very traditional and many similar tapas can be found in Madrid with the wood carved doors and tiled walls. They have a simple menu which was a little confusing at first. Tapas is tricky when you are dining alone as you either end up with too little variety or too many things. I had some chorizo off the tapas plates which was served on toast but was very plain and then some prawns from the larger plates which were delicious. a plate of 10 large prawns simply grilled.

We read about it on tripadvisor and were looking forward to our lunch very much, but what a horrible experience. For us, paying 25 euros each for a menu is a big treat and something we cannot afford often, so it was also a dreadful waste of money. We were disappointed by the limited and rather boring choices for the menu de casa, but both decided on the potage to start with. It was simply garbanzos in a wishy washy tomato sauce with a few bits of egg white thrown in. Probably cost them about 25 cents to make two platefuls. It was edible - that's the best we could say.  Then we chose entrecote. Well, I have never seen an entrecote like that before. Slabs of grey meat, half of each portion was fat and gristle, and so tough that they could not be cut even with the steak knives. Not sure what kind of animal it was. It was inedible. The waiter noticed us not eating, and simply came up and asked if it was not to our taste, took away the plates and asked would we like postre. We just paid and left.

The place itself is sweet. Authentic, local, cosy and has a family feel to it. It‚Äôs not modern, in fact very rustic and Spanish. With the walls adorned with bullfight art and pictures and matador photography. The tables are covered with red and white checked table clothes and it feels quite spacious over two floors but certainly lacking any kind of atmosphere. It was quiet and even when busier felt quiet in chatter. No background music either. The greeting was nice, if not a little formal and matter of fact rather than a warm welcome. The menu was fairly extensive and very authentic to its cuisine, which could be lost on those that aren‚Äôt too adventurous, but exciting to try. Olives are given to you, and complimentary too and are exceptionally tasty. Along with the bread too. The sangria is lovely and comes as it should with wooden spoon, fruit and a real kick. Very tasty. The chicken croquettes were delicious and the manchego cheese really very generous and tasty.  That‚Äôs about the best part of the meal, the rest was underwhelming, flavourless and bland. 1 main dish was forgotten completely and others alerted to what we had expected. None of the mains come with sides or accompanying dishes so order separate. The artichokes were soggy and grey, hugely overlooked in my opinion. No apology for forgotten dish, no rush to get bill or offer on any drinks, we were ignored for water and not asked during meal for anything else.  There was no farewell. Maybe it was an off day and I‚Äôll just be one poor review of the many positives, as it‚Äôs clearly a popular place.

Since opening in the 40's, Ava Gardner, who apparently had a thing for bullfighters, spent quite a bit of time here. The walls are covered in pictures documenting the history of this sport. I believe Hemingway himself said that bullfighting, auto racing and mountain climbing were the only true sports and everything else was simply a game, but I digress. So my wife and I were in the Chueca neighborhood and stumbled into Casa Salvador. It was lunchtime and this place was packed. There was only one table on the lower level by the door and one of the male waiters just was going to put us there. A couple of minutes later, one of the female members of the staff looked mortified and moved us upstairs into the depths of this Madrid home of many 2 hour plus lunches. First of all you need to be dressed decently. Collared shirts, perhaps a sweater, even a tie and jacket are pretty standard it seems, since many of the patrons are taking lunch during the workday. One of the specialties of the house is the rabo del toro, which is of course the tail of the bull who may or may not have met his end with a matador. The dish was pretty good, with peas and a good mushroom based sauce. If you find yourself in the neighborhood, I recommend a nice leisurely meal soaking up the history, cuisine, and local flavor of this institution.",2011-03-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2034008-Reviews-or140-Restaurante_Casa_Salvador-Madrid.html,UID_38731,0.01,0.899,0.09,0.9731,0.1722222222222222,0.4793650793650793,0.2553499999999999,1399,126,0.0900643316654753,0,28,False,42,0.25,0.1388888888888889,0.25,0.0555555555555555,0.1944444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833333333333333,0.0277777777777777,258,172,4.426356589147287,0,0,heard restaur quit stori sinc open ava gardner appar thing bullfight spent quit bit time wall cover pictur document histori sport believ hemingway said bullfight auto race mountain climb true sport everyth els simpli game digress wife chueca neighborhood stumbl casa salvador lunchtim place pack one tabl lower level door one male waiter go put us coupl minut later one femal member staff look mortifi move us upstair depth madrid home mani hour plu lunch first need dress decent collar shirt perhap sweater even tie jacket pretti standard seem sinc mani patron take lunch workday one specialti hous rabo del toro cours tail bull may may met end matador dish pretti good pea good mushroom base sauc find neighborhood recommend nice leisur meal soak histori cuisin local flavor institut,good review,4

Also it was important for us that the restaurant could be visited during the late hours because first we went to a soccergame. We arrived 11:30 PM on a Saturday evening but the owner still welcomed us with a big smile. The fun part is, that the restaurant is sorted very chaotic.For example, when you enter you think the restaurant is quite small, but when they take you along to find a table, you'll pass the dishwasher, the kitchen, the bar, ... you can see everything getting prepared with your own eyes. The place was very crowded and have to say, many Spanish people and very few foreigners. Always a good sign! And offcourse, a lot of people eating means also a lot of food passing by. Very fresh! Finally we got a seat in a smaller seperate room. We ordered a seafood platter for two people. What you get, is what you can see from other reviewers. The tower of seafood is high, great, the taste is wonderfull, fresh and rather cheap!  Don't order the housewine but the more 'expensive' white wine (14,5 euro for a bottle). Really good value. We arrived in the restaurant at 11:30 PM and left the restaurant two hours later and yes, we only ordered the seafood platter!

He even told us they were out of the bacalao fritters but we heard another table order it after us. But that was not it, I could not decide what to order so ordered the veal steak, the most expensive meat main on the menu. Immediately upon it being served I saw the hair. It could not be missed. I do not know how the waiter could have missed it. When we told him about it, he seemed non-plussed and merely said sorry.

We turned up on a Saturday just after 8pm, thinking it'd be quiet, since the Spanish eat later. However, it was already very busy. They did find us a table for two without us having a reservation. Tip: make a reservation, as when we left, there was a queue. We went straight for the seafood platter for two. Prawns, more prawns, langoustines, more prawns, crabs, barnacles (yes, barnacles!), finally finishing with more crab in its shell. Huge, just huge and messy, but delicious, although we weren't too impressed with the barnacles, there's not a great deal to them. After all that, we tried the Galician almond cake or Tarta de Santiago. This is very simple but truly fabulous. That was accompanied by two free shots of some yellow sweet liqueur (no idea what that was). This was all washed down with a 15 euro bottle of Albarino wine, again fabulous. Total bill was around 62 euros. Given than was for a phenomenal amount of seafood, plus pudding and a cracking bottle of wine, oh and water too, I'd say it's excellent value. This place is buzzing. Once you find it, it's not too far off the beaten track. We'll definitely be back, maybe this time trying something slightly different. We did notice quite a few tables having pimiento de padron for starters, then a platter of prawns. That might well be a slightly lighter meal. If you look at their website, they even do their seafood platters to take away!

Before going there it is important to know that it is a loud place, not very sophisticated, and you'll probably have to wait before they give you a table, because that's what happen in popular places: it's very crowded If you want to avoid the wait, you need to come early around 20:30, or come at lunchtime in weekdays I would recommend this restaurant when you are with friends, before going out clubbing, so that you can happily wait drinking beers with tapas at the bar until a table gets free. I never went there in daytime, but that would a good option aswell. If you go alone, you might need to bring a book for the wait. They give you a number for the wait, or they keep your name. Maybe not exactly good for a first date, but good with your partner if you know you have the same tastes. Typical old style spanish seafood restaurant, white walls with tiles , galician decoration hanging at the ceiling , funny proverbs in frames. The tiles reverberate the sound, so having spanish peoples yelling jokes and the natural reverb of the tiles gives a noisy atmosphere, that is why every room of the restaurant has a frame saying ""FORBIDDEN TO SING"", you can easily imagine why ! Waiters are old professionals, so the they are straighforward and kinda rough, but always respectful. Sometimes they joke if they see that you are in party mood. I recommend having some beers at the bar, with a raci√≥n of ham ( jam√≥n = smoked ham, or lac√≥n = boiled ham ) or octopuss. Then order a mariscada for the number of people you have.  In this place a mariscada is a pyramid made of the following layers, from smaller and soft, to big and hard: - on top you have gambas ( prawns )  - layer of langostinos (schrimps) - cigalas ( Nephrops ) , these are kind of schrimps but with harder skin. - some percebes ( barnacle ) , when you eat these watch out not to spit the juice on the shirt of your date, or neighboring table - the bigger crabs : n√©cora ( sea spider) , centollo , crab , I never could distinghish them. You eat the inside of the crab with a spoon.  It is a very high caloric meal, so better to have a walk in the city after or go dancing to burn all this energy. All this seafood you have to open , destroy shell and skin with your fingers, or seafood tools and fork, while drinking the white wine of the restaurant ( vino de la casa ). Getting a little tipsy helps with this hard work. At the end of the battle, the table is full of waste and they give you something to rince your fingers. Now you can order a QUEIMADA, which is a mix of hard licor with coffee, sugar and lemon. It is like a ceremonial , and people of galicia have a spell to read for the fertility of the fields, used to be said by the Meigas ( witches). They bring the pot with hard licor with sugar, and put the fire on it. You have to stir with a ladle , until the fire goes out with the alcool ( they say, but you can simply shut off fire by blowing, and get drunk). Then the waiter comes wiht a jar of coffee, pours the coffe in the pot and you can drink the licor ( orujo ) with coffee. Sometimes the neighboring table ask you if you want some of their queimada, because it is a lot of alcool. If you have too much of yours, don't be scared to offer to the other table.

This place gives you complimentary chicken wings as soon as you are seated and we were quite happy with the wings. We ordered mixed paella and stew tripe to hare. The portion size was huge! We could not believe how big the paella was, especially when it was only ‚Ç¨7.5. The paella was full of large pieces of tender calamari and juicy chicken, and a few small shrimps. The rice absorbed all the yummy seafood and saffron flavour. We could not get enough of it. The tripe was pretty good as well. The tomato sauce had lots of spices and also packed a little heat in it.

We were fortunate to have a good written guide to Madrid which pointed us to this establishment at lunchtime; that's after 14:00 in Spain. We established that the bar and occupied tables were frequented by locals - usually a good sign - and by the time that my partner had visited the WC I already had received, without any request on my part, a plate of fried chicken pieces as appetitiser.  The menu is wonderfully short - which means that the kitchen staff concentrate on doing relatively few things extremely well rather than attempting to do many things half-well. We had a bottle of Spanish white wine - the most expensive on the list - and with three large tapas dishes of tortilla, meat balls and a salad, each of which justified the tag 'meal' in its own right, plus a bottle of water, the bill came to less than ¬£40. The atmosphere was lively with a steady flow of new customers (on their lunch hours?) coming in for a drink and sharing plates of food with friends and colleagues. From the outside there is nothing to suggest anything special about this venue. The internal wall surfaces are a happy blend of textures and colours; much like the exhibitions we saw later during our time in Madrid on a visit to a modern art gallery.. What makes this a great destination for any visitor to this area of Madrid is the feeling that you are being granted an opportunity to see and experience a little piece of Spanish life.",2013-04-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1775780-Reviews-or440-Taberna_Alhambra-Madrid.html,UID_17731,0.0,0.845,0.155,0.9918,0.177245670995671,0.4568975468975469,0.3348125,1510,130,0.086092715231788,0,31,False,55,0.1739130434782608,0.1739130434782608,0.2898550724637681,0.1014492753623188,0.1304347826086956,0.0144927536231884,0.0144927536231884,0.0434782608695652,0.0144927536231884,0.0434782608695652,273,177,4.531135531135531,0,0,within vicin bar restaur number eat venu fortun good written guid madrid point us establish lunchtim spain establish bar occupi tabl frequent local usual good sign time partner visit wc alreadi receiv without request part plate fri chicken piec appetitis menu wonder short mean kitchen staff concentr rel thing extrem well rather attempt mani thing half well bottl spanish white wine expens list three larg tapa dish tortilla meat ball salad justifi tag meal right plu bottl water bill came less atmospher live steadi flow new custom lunch hour come drink share plate food friend colleagu outsid noth suggest anyth special venu intern wall surfac happi blend textur colour much like exhibit saw later time madrid visit modern art galleri make great destin visitor area madrid feel grant opportun see experi littl piec spanish life,good review,4

As the restaurant is very close to Plaza Mayor, I was expecting it to be a bit of a tourist trap, but in fact we had a very enjoyable meal. The restaurant specialises in food from the Galician region of northern Spain, so features fish and shellfish very heavily - be aware that there is a live lobster tank in the restaurant, so avoid if that kind of thing bothers you! And also be aware that neither fish nor shellfish is a particularly cheap dining option in Madrid or indeed anywhere else, so your meal is likely to be relatively expensive compared to the average tapas bar. The restaurant has an old fashioned feel to it. Service was professional and fairly discreet; at one point the waiter obviously felt we had waited too long for our main course (we were actually quite happy), so came over to apologise and let us know it was on its way.  All the food was well presented and cooked. Our Calamari √† la plancha starter was delicious. The Santiago almond tart for dessert was amazing, as indeed was the cheese, and membrillo (although be warned, this comes as an enormous portion that I defy any one person to eat, so is certainly worth sharing). The only slight disappointment was our main course choice of 'Lobster with rice'. Nothing wrong with the dish per se, it was tasty and certainly filling (a lot of rice!!) but we struggled to see a whole 'large' lobster in it, as promised on the menu. To be honest, it felt a bit like a dish made with left-over lobster, and therefore not worth ‚Ç¨50 for two. Were we scammed? Maybe. But the rest of the meal was good value (although not cheap) and the 'house' Albarino at around ‚Ç¨18 at was very drinkable, so I'm giving them them the benefit of the doubt. I'd probably go back, and just be a little bit more circumspect about what I ordered next time.",2017-04-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697476-Reviews-or90-Casa_Gallega-Madrid.html,UID_30912,0.053,0.774,0.173,0.995,0.1953659361471861,0.5253333333333334,0.62088125,1939,166,0.0856111397627643,3,55,False,75,0.1025641025641025,0.1282051282051282,0.3076923076923077,0.0512820512820512,0.141025641025641,0.0256410256410256,0.0256410256410256,0.0641025641025641,0.1025641025641025,0.0512820512820512,356,225,4.446629213483146,0,0,took pot luck casa gallega decid san miguel market crowd although food look delici restaur close plaza mayor expect bit tourist trap fact enjoy meal restaur specialis food galician region northern spain featur fish shellfish heavili awar live lobster tank restaur avoid kind thing bother also awar neither fish shellfish particularli cheap dine option madrid inde anywher els meal like rel expens compar averag tapa bar restaur old fashion feel servic profession fairli discreet one point waiter obvious felt wait long main cours actual quit happi came apologis let us know way food well present cook calamari la plancha starter delici santiago almond tart dessert amaz inde chees membrillo although warn come enorm portion defi one person eat certainli worth share slight disappoint main cours choic lobster rice noth wrong dish per se tasti certainli fill lot rice struggl see whole larg lobster promis menu honest felt bit like dish made left lobster therefor worth two scam mayb rest meal good valu although cheap hous albarino around drinkabl give benefit doubt probabl go back littl bit circumspect order next time,average review,3

It certainly didn't disappoint!  This restaurant was about 10 minute walk from the Palace Real.  When we arrived, we didn't have any reservations but the waiters were kind enough to let us have a table. We were given complimentary traditional potato cakes to start with and even though the waiters spoke simple English, they undetood us well enough. The waiters were all old school type, and you could tell they really took pride in their jobs. We want straight to mains, and I had the grilled sole and my partner had the escalope in egg batter. The food was of high quality and the fish was extremely fresh. The veal was soft and tender and was delicious. You could tell this restaurant really takes pride in the quality of their food. We were so impressed with the food that we proceeded to have our dessert there. I ordered cream crepes which was not too sweet, very fresh and delicious and my partner, really enjoyed his tiramisu. He is Italian, and loves his sweets so for him to really enjoy his tiramisu, speaks volumes! We were also given complimentary festive cinnamon donuts on the side which was a nice touch.  The total bill came out to be around 65 Euro, (no alcohol. Just sparkling water) which was very decent considering the good food. I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants high quality good value for money food in Madrid.  By the time we left the restaurant was full and the waiters had to turn people without reservations away. Majority of the patrons were older aged / family locals, and not many tourists at all.

It presents as an old fashioned pub from the outside and inside like a small house which had been converted into a restaurant.The restaurant appears like a place that was caught in a time warp arounf the 1940's with the small tables all covered in gigham tablecloths and the walls festooned with very dramatic but gory bulfighting scenes from a bygone era.The clientele were predominanly Spainish business people .The waiters were very curtious but ordering was a bit of a struggle as they did not speak English so a phrase book at least is recommended. After several attempts they finally got the order correct and our advice would be to point at the dish you require on the menu and not to use terms such as ""I will have the same as her"" as you could end up sharing one steak instead of having one each.In the event the steaks though modest in size, lived up to their reputation and the flambe desert was dramatic in the way it was served and delicious to eat. The cost was very reasonable at ‚Ç¨108 for 3 adults which included a bottle and a half of very decent Rioja wine.There was also a complementary after dinner drink provided.We would certainly reccommend it as a wonderful old worldy Spainish experience for dinner or a leisurly lunch particularly if you enjoy steak.",2012-11-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2034008-Reviews-or120-Restaurante_Casa_Salvador-Madrid.html,UID_10557,0.01,0.854,0.136,0.9891,0.1003061224489795,0.465875850340136,0.4360333333333333,1516,133,0.087730870712401,0,17,False,55,0.0980392156862745,0.0980392156862745,0.2745098039215686,0.0392156862745098,0.0980392156862745,0.0784313725490196,0.0588235294117647,0.0588235294117647,0.1176470588235294,0.0784313725490196,272,175,4.577205882352941,0,0,recommend daughter australian colleagu best steak restaur madrid certainli live took time locat somewhat tourist track well worth effort present old fashion pub outsid insid like small hous convert restaur restaur appear like place caught time warp arounf small tabl cover gigham tablecloth wall festoon dramat gori bulfight scene bygon era clientel predominanli spainish busi peopl waiter curtiou order bit struggl speak english phrase book least recommend sever attempt final got order correct advic would point dish requir menu use term could end share one steak instead one event steak though modest size live reput flamb desert dramat way serv delici eat cost reason adult includ bottl half decent rioja wine also complementari dinner drink provid would certainli reccommend wonder old worldi spainish experi dinner leisurli lunch particularli enjoy steak,good review,4

Our waiter Fernando was very helpful, he recommended a great bottle of Rioja. We tried the tortilla de patatas, the ib√©rico ham and manchego cheese. All excellent.

Dessert we tried their traditional fried cheese, that comes with nougat ice cream. Magnificent.
