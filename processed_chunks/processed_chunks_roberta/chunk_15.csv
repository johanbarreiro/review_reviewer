We ordered several dishes for the wife and I to share.  The Argentinian Empandas were delicious. The Gambás al Ajilo was good. It could have been great. This was the only issue we had with the entire meal. The shrimp were drowned in the sauce and there was little to no garlic in the dish. The shrimp were cooked perfectly.

Super happy, smiling staff makes the enjoyment of a meal so much better..  a person happy to serve you means a top rated restaurant for me... I had a small request of my meal.. no patatas and no salad.. generally it’s no potatoes for me, but the salad was hard to push away..  I’m feeding the inner carnivore.. I ordered the Argentinian Lomo on the better side of medium rare, and a side of perfect salmon. On the medium side of cooked too.. What arrive was nothing short of devine intervention.. Maybe I was hungry, of course, my appetite wetted, but all boxes were ticked.. Juicy, tender, right amounts of good fats were on the steak pictured.. The knife fell thru the meat effortlessly, and devoured oh so well... The salmon, crisp on the outside, and warming thru the middle..

A colleague, who is from Madrid, recommended it to me and I will certainly thank her when I see her again! Mu! is an Argentinian steak restaurant with a small but fine selection of beefy cuts, plus fish alternatives for those who don't want red meat. The menu also contains other fine Argentinian staples such as blood sausage and empanadas. I had a 350g Black Angus which was cooked perfectly and my partner had a chunky steak of salmon which, again, was cooked perfectly. We shared sides of fries and salad, accompanied by wine and beer. We barely had space for dessert but managed to share a creme caramel. In total, the meal only cost 40 EURO. Great service too. Fantastic! Highly recommended.

Maybe 3-4 hours later, we've just got back to our apartment and are both ridiculously well-fed (I mean ridiculously!).

In reality, we probably overdid it with the portions we ate (neither of us can really walk at the moment), but that steak was the best I've ever eaten, hands down. To top it off, the staff were lovely and attentive, interested in our experience and just quite impressive. Bravo all around!

Incredibly there are a few negative comments I've read but just ignore them! Yes it is very small and if you go later in the evening you will probably have to wait for a table as I once did. You have the choice to either wait or go elsewhere, so why moan about it? The fact that there are people queuing usually means it's good. Not only is it cheap, the food is remarkably good. Popcorn while you wait, empanadas , steak, ice cream, beer, bread and a complimentary fruit shot for 10€ is amazing.

I like to think of myself as a steak enthusiast, I've been to many steakhouses and I can confidently say this is one of, if not the best place for steak I've had the pleasure of eating at. They know how to cook and marinade their meat without ruining the natural flavour of it, every bite is heavenly.  The value for money on the menu is exceptional, a starter(Chorizo, Morcilla, or beef/chicken empanadas), which are all amazing, a steak (personally I had the skirt and flank, and would say the flank was better), chips/salad, drink and dessert all for only 10€! This could easily be doubled in price and still be worth it, the flank steak is amazing, but the crown of MU is the Black Angus, Argentinian fillet at 20€ and separate to the menu, but the size and flavour of it makes it definitely worth the price, I would suggest this for dinner and the menu for a lunch.  And to top it all off, not only is the food amazing but the staff are too, everyone is so helpful and friendly, i brought my sister here and her steak was a bit overdone for her liking, and they happily replaced it with nothing but a smile, and was more than accommodating to my nut allergy (in the brownie). Lucas especially is so kind and will go out of his way to make sure you're experience was nothing but the best, and he's a genuine nice guy too! If you are in Madrid you HAVE to come here! I know I'll be back a couple more times before I leave.

Server Mike was very attentive and he took our photo and also a selfie- it was fun! We realized service at restaurants and bars seemed slow so it was nice to have Mike attending to our group. One point for meat eaters: in Spain, meat seems to be undercooked so a medium in Spain is far less cooked than a medium in USA. Two members of our group ordered the monstrous Tomahawk steak and it came with a small table grill which came in handy because many of us put our meat on it to cook it more.

So I decided to...,"I happened to walk by this place and glance at the menu after visiting the museum. I was looking for a spot with lighter fare options for a very late lunch and a few dishes on their menu caught my eye. So I decided to step in. First off, the staff here is wonderful. I was traveling solo (mid 40s female who only speaks about 20-30 words of Spanish), and from the beginning, despite my lack of Spanish language skills, everyone who works at this restaurant was very friendly and welcoming, and I did not feel at all awkward dining on my own or made to feel that I was holding up a table for a larger party. And judging by other people dining there, they serve a fairly diverse crowd. Service and hospitality was impeccable, efficient (without being overdone), and warm. Shout out to all of the friendly wait staff, and especially to Emilio, who offered a cinnamon-rice milk liquor to top off my salmon and avocado salad (which was also perfect). I also really liked the decor--it's warm, rustic, and very inviting. If you are looking for a change from regular tapas restaurants in the area (i.e. you are visiting the Reina Sofia or Prado Museum), I highly recommend this place. I would definitely go back again if I'm in the area and try some of their other dishes.",2018-07-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7062431-Reviews-or270-Oven_Mozzarella_Bar_Fuencarral-Madrid.html,UID_3125,0.006,0.833,0.161,0.989,0.2279464285714285,0.5302472527472527,0.3477545454545454,1265,115,0.0909090909090909,0,40,False,47,0.1272727272727272,0.109090909090909,0.2545454545454545,0.0545454545454545,0.2181818181818181,0.0363636363636363,0.0181818181818181,0.0181818181818181,0.1272727272727272,0.0363636363636363,231,153,4.48051948051948,0,0,happen walk place glanc menu visit museum look spot lighter fare option late lunch dish menu caught eye decid step first staff wonder travel solo mid femal speak word spanish begin despit lack spanish languag skill everyon work restaur friendli welcom feel awkward dine made feel hold tabl larger parti judg peopl dine serv fairli divers crowd servic hospit impecc effici without overdon warm shout friendli wait staff especi emilio offer cinnamon rice milk liquor top salmon avocado salad also perfect also realli like decor warm rustic invit look chang regular tapa restaur area e visit reina sofia prado museum highli recommend place would definit go back area tri dish,very good review,5

It was our second night in a row when a man was let into the restaurant and stole my wife’s purse. Luckily we were on second floor and a lady next to us noticed he had put the purse under his jacket and she told us and we had time to catch him before he got to the front door. We yelled he stole a purse and he dropped the purse steps from the front door. Not one person from the restaurant asked us if we were ok or asked what had happened. I caught the guy outside and nobody came to help from the restaurant and when we went back in to eat nobody from the restaurant said a word to us about what had happened despite the fact that everyone heard.

Excellent service from very busy staff. Had 6 dishes between two all excellent. Lots of choice for vegetarians. Some are nice twists on regular tapas such as the potatoes with Brutal dressing. Standout was the Burrata injected at the table using an impressive syringe with fresh pesto. The tomatoes accompanying this and the goat cheese tapas were extraordinary.

Everything we ordered was a winner! You really can’t go wrong with any of the items on the menu. The prices are pretty good too. I wish we could stay in Madrid longer to try it all.

Although things seemed welcoming as we walked in, we slowly realized that this isn't a tapas restaurant. It was more like a late night bar serving bar food. The staff spent the entire time just talking to each other and ignored our table. When we managed to order, the food that came was poor. The jamon was the cheapest type you can get in a supermarket and this was by far our worst meal and service in Madrid. When it came time to pay, I had to ask THREE times for the bill. Each time I was told it was coming. We were sitting at the table right opposite the bar, looking impatient, credit card in hand - there was no way they didn't know we wanted to pay - they just didn't care. In the end I had to walk to the bar to insist that I pay. They all laughed to each other (my wife saw this from a distance and assumed they were trying to cheat me on the bill, so came up and checked the bill line by line... that's how in-in-your-face obnoxious the staff were). I almost walked out without paying.

The menu was primarily full plates (raciones), many with half size (media) options, but few tapas-sized dishes. All of the food arrived within 5 minutes of ordering and before one of our cocktails. People were waiting for a table at the bar when we finished our food, so we decided to head off somewhere else for a post-dinner drink. We got a couple of complementary liqueurs on paying the bill.

If there's something I learned while in Madrid...its to make reservations at the places that take them!!! The main host (possibly the manager/owner) took great care of us, even apologizing for making us wait even though we were the ones that arrived unannounced. Ordered a pitcher of sangria €10, enough for 2-3 people. Had patatas con brutal sauce - spicy. Also ordered the risotto as well as the veal - both very tasty, wish they came in bigger portions but I guess they are technically tapas! And we ordered the paella, it's €15pp and there must be at least 2 people per table who will order it (aka €30 for the paella). Food was tasty, just as they advertise- traditional yet different - I really appreciated the creativity that went into their dishes. The service was great.

However, the service was unfortunately the worst in the whole of Madrid. We arrived at 8:55 for a 9pm booking and waited for 10 minutes to be served, only to be told our table still wasn't ready. No real apology was given. Took over 30 minutes to order some wine and food. Food took over 45 minutes to come. Also asking for the bill for a bit of an ordeal. Clearly very understaffed and don't seem to care about repeat custom, or making your evening special at all.  Staff were just plain rude, which was a massive shame! I know you were all busy, but there is no excuse.

We were seated...","In a centric area of Madrid, near the metro station of Tribunal, lies a charming italian restaurant with a cozy atmosphere that although at first sight it might not have an eye catching facade, it is worth visiting for a great experience.  We were seated in a nice table that had natural light coming from the lively streets of the summer-y Madrid, with a refreshing air conditioner while we waited really short time, we were attended by their really good staff that was attentive enough to explain us thoroughly the dishes on the menu (which was in English and Spanish, depending on the customer) and clear us any doubts about them.   After deciding what to eat, the waiter kept a good distance while still taking a look on us from time to time, enough to ask something when needed, and not intrusive enough to make it any awkward, which fell on the perfect side. The food was brought and although that was my first provoleta, I must recomend it as the entrée thoroughly, we ate it as a kind of deconstructed pizza, given that we asked for extra bread (that was warm an delicious on its own), and it made me even like those sweet purple onions, and I almost always dislike them. Once we got to the main course, my friend had some Tagliatelle De Bolo (bolognese pasta) that also were pretty good. Sadly, although my calzone was good, it didn't get on the levels of the previous food and my friends, and surely not on the level of the service we got, which was outstanding. I found my calzone a bit chewy and lacking a little Je ne sais quoi. If you have some calzone needs, I might sugest you to go for the pizza, that looked outstanding on the other tables. It still was really good and left me really full, I wanted to ask for dessert, but I just was full enough that any more would be pure glutony, although I might come other day to see what they have, definitely recommended. Although at first we were greeted by some nice air conditioner, near ending our meal on the restaurant, it felt like the temperature inside rose up a bit, not plain awful, but I wished the air conditioner stayed a bit longer.  I would just recommend this restaurant just for the service. Shout out specially and foremost to Francisco for making it an awesome experience with his really good will to give us an impecable service worth of praise and the rest of the staff for their kindness.",2018-06-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7062431-Reviews-or290-Oven_Mozzarella_Bar_Fuencarral-Madrid.html,UID_14033,0.017,0.809,0.173,0.9964,0.2631338899196042,0.577790375409423,0.2818727272727273,2370,206,0.0869198312236286,0,50,False,111,0.1192660550458715,0.1651376146788991,0.3119266055045872,0.073394495412844,0.1743119266055046,0.0275229357798165,0.0275229357798165,0.018348623853211,0.0642201834862385,0.018348623853211,433,244,4.466512702078522,0,0,centric area madrid near metro station tribun lie charm italian restaur cozi atmospher although first sight might eye catch facad worth visit great experi seat nice tabl natur light come live street summer madrid refresh air condition wait realli short time attend realli good staff attent enough explain us thoroughli dish menu english spanish depend custom clear us doubt decid eat waiter kept good distanc still take look us time time enough ask someth need intrus enough make awkward fell perfect side food brought although first provoleta must recomend entr e thoroughli ate kind deconstruct pizza given ask extra bread warm delici made even like sweet purpl onion almost alway dislik got main cours friend tagliatel de bolo bolognes pasta also pretti good sadli although calzon good get level previou food friend sure level servic got outstand found calzon bit chewi lack littl je ne sai quoi calzon need might sugest go pizza look outstand tabl still realli good left realli full want ask dessert full enough would pure glutoni although might come day see definit recommend although first greet nice air condition near end meal restaur felt like temperatur insid rose bit plain aw wish air condition stay bit longer would recommend restaur servic shout special foremost francisco make awesom experi realli good give us impec servic worth prais rest staff kind,very good review,5

HOWEVER, I would NOT recommend this restaurant for allergy suffers. I have a severe nut/peanut allergy and ordered a Salmon Salad which was clearly labelled on the menu as NOT containing nuts. I chose this because all pizzas contained nuts as well as the majority of pasta dishes. As soon as I ate the salad and breadsticks/bread that accompanied (after checking for content of nuts) my mouth began to tingle, this was the start of my allergic reaction. Despite clearly notifying the waiter I have since had to receive emergency treatment and it was deeply distressing.

""Anything under 6...","4 amigos and I sat on the grass of the Parque de El Retiro, taking in the Spanish air, content within ourselves after a wonderful weekend of music and frivolities at MadCool Festival, when we became peckish as the sun passed overhead.  ""Anything under 6 euros"", whimpered Joel. ""I'm probably not going to eat anything"", said Simon, fishing through crumpled receipts and folded boarding passes in his prized manbag for any spare coins. ""Macs"", declared Ben hopefully, knowing deep down inside that he would be inevitably be shot down. ""I'll look up somewhere on Google"", I said heroically, taking charge of the situation like a matador grasping the horns of hunger. And what a decision that was. We came across Mu! and were naturally skeptical of its low prices at first, but after reading raving reviews of the famous €10 menu, Joel miraculously found another €4 and Simon decided that Daddy's wallet could stretch a little further. And so, with the exhaust fume-filled breeze in our hair, we made our way to the restaurant.  After having narrowly avoided sideswipes from (rightfully) aggressive Spanish drivers, we set down our bags outside the establishment and took in the menu. Delightful. Almost too good to be true, surely. Nonetheless, we asked for a table for cinco and were seated within 5 minutes. The restaurant was small but welcoming, and so the wait was justified and retrospectively a small price to pay for the wonders within. We were greeted by excellent music and a trough of salted popcorn, causing us to immediately become wary of the classic trick of being drawn in by low prices and then charged for seemingly complimentary treats. Having suffered this exact fate at a small pizzeria in Mallorca a mere fortnight beforehand, the memories were still raw. We then ordered from the €10 menu (see attached), covering most of the meal options between the 5 of us and were shortly given bread with homemade chimichurri, which was delicious. Personally, I can vouch for the chorizo (and a mouthful of chicken empanada), skirt steak, chips, estrella and espresso being excellent. The meat was succulent, well-seasoned and the steak cooked to a delectable medium rare without even having to ask. By the end of the meal, we decided that there must have been a catch, but we were too satisfied to care. The final touch to this gem was a shot of Bailey's (or a similar brand of cream-based liqueur) each. We weren't complaining, but as we asked for the bill we all knew that we'd be paying more than €10 per head. The popcorn, the bread, the chimichurri and finally the Bailey's, it all seemed like a mirage in a desert of overpriced, low quality, tourist-targeted cuisine. But we opened the bill to find it was indeed a true oasis. €50. We were frankly amazed. We paid the very friendly waiter and tipped him so that we didn't leave feeling like thieves and headed into the hazy Madrid afternoon, fill both with fantastic Argentinian meat and smugness in the knowledge of our newfound retreat.  ""So long, farewell"" we sang harmoniously as we descended into the metro, waving shoulder to shoulder, like a scene from The Sound of Mu!sic. A tear rolled down Simon's cheek, but we swore that this would not be the last time we visited that humble eatery, so until next time, Mu!.

Don't get me wrong, the food you get for the money is definitely a good value, however the service left me feeling pretty bad. Our order included dessert and after we finished eating the first courses we just sat patiently waiting for someone to come take our order for the dessert. We sat there for 30 minutes before we decided to ask if we could order the dessert. He took our order and then just walked away and started doing other things. It seemed like he never actually put the order in as we waited another 15 minutes for 2 slices of flan. So we asked another waiter about the flans. He was super agitated and rude and kept demanding whether I was saying flan or flanK (as in flanK steak). I was pretty thrown off guard by the way he talked to me. I also don't think what I said sounded anything like ""flanK"" and why in the world would I be ordering a flanK steak after I just ate meal from a menu that included dessert.

We sat inside and it's definitely a cosy location. Only room for maybe 20-30 people but the location was nice and we were sat quickly at a nice table. There was a bowl of complimentary popcorn on the table which was nice start to wet our appetites. I opted for the ""menu"" which was excellent value for money as it included 3 courses and a drink for only €10! I had empanada, flank steak, ice cream, and a Diet Coke. The empanada was excellent, the steak was nicely cooked, but maybe a bit fatty for my taste. The fries that came with it were a little undercooked but still nice. My partner had a chicken Ceasar salad but was less impressed. The chicken was unappetising in appearance and almost had a broiled taste rather that baked or fried. All in all the waiters were great.

The resorts were in very rural areas, and the rooms and facilities were beautiful. The food however, was very ordinary. On my last weekend, a Friday and Saturday in Madrid, I checked into my hotel just off the Gran Via. I looked at trip advisor and saw this place was only a block away and had great reviews. I'm guessing it was around 8 or 9 so I headed out looking for dinner.  It turned out this was only about a half block from my hotel, I could see it from the entrance. I walked up the cobblestone streets and looked in. It was a tiny tiny place, but already packed, except for a place at the bar. I sat down and took a look at the menu. I got a flatiron steak with chimichurri and a green salad, topped off with an Estrella beer.  This is a Brazilian steakhouse and I am thinking the steak was $11 Euros and with salad and beer the entire mean was under $20 Euros....AND they gave me a shot of some Irish Cream with something spicy in it just before I paid. All the guys who worked here, and the people who were eating here were happy and fun. It has a lot of energy, and the food is fantastic.  I would definitely recommend this for one or two people. It's awesome.

And he was right! The food was absolutely delicious, fabulous cocktails and very innovative way of serving them! Firstly I tried to book a table via Facebook - but the system is only set-up for the groups of 9. So I messaged them and got the reply Right away. Still had to call the restaurant - but my messages were answered in a really nice manner.  Later in the evening had to call them to say we are late for dinner but they said they will keep a table for us. Once we arrived - we were told we have a bit more than 1.5hour for our dinner - which was fine with us as it was our fault we couldn't make it on time. Atmosphere was electric in that place - so busy (but in a good way). Everything was served in a good time, we never had to wonder if food or drinks are missing. Oscar (who was our waiter) was a superstar! Santiago also made us feel very welcomed. There was another man (didn't get his name) but he was setting up a table close to us and asked if its ok if he will place a chair at the corner of other table so the person will sit back to us. We didn't think it was tight so we agreed and were awarded for it with some shots :) Highly recommend this place for food & drink lovers - top notch!",2016-10-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10358028-Reviews-or1180-Inclan_Brutal_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_14195,0.029,0.792,0.179,0.9923,0.2164789377289377,0.569441391941392,0.4609384615384615,1311,134,0.1022120518688024,4,38,False,66,0.1052631578947368,0.175438596491228,0.2807017543859649,0.0526315789473684,0.1929824561403508,0.0175438596491228,0.0175438596491228,0.0175438596491228,0.0701754385964912,0.0701754385964912,264,163,3.965909090909091,0,0,recommend friend visit inclan brutal bar said wont disappoint right food absolut delici fabul cocktail innov way serv firstli tri book tabl via facebook system set group messag got repli right away still call restaur messag answer realli nice manner later even call say late dinner said keep tabl us arriv told bit hour dinner fine us fault make time atmospher electr place busi good way everyth serv good time never wonder food drink miss oscar waiter superstar santiago also made us feel welcom anoth man get name set tabl close us ask ok place chair corner tabl person sit back us think tight agre award shot highli recommend place food drink lover top notch,very good review,5

The homemade ravioli was under done and instead of being al-dente they were hard and not cooked, in addition they were not seasoned at all and required lots of salt to give some flavor, the el sur salad was a mix of spinach lettuce strawberries cheese and pine nuts but nothing connected all the ingredients together. The croquettes never came to the table although we reminded one of the waiters. The whiskey sour tasted like no other I’ve ever tasted, and I sampled this cocktail around the globe.

We had a reservation for 8:30, but we showed up at 8:15. Although there was one person serving at the bar and three on the floor, they all ignored us for nearly 20 minutes. There was a growing line of people behind us, but despite it all, the waiters hustled around the place, refusing to even pick up their eyes to see if anybody might want to find a table. Once we were finally seated, it took another 15 minutes to even get a waiter's attention to take our order. We ordered everything at once because it was becoming evident that this was going to be a bit of an ordeal. It took another 15 minutes for my wife's drink to show up. Mine didn't show up for another 15 minutes after that. It took 30 minutes for one cocktail! The food showed up before it did! The food itself was tasty, though slightly cold and certainly not worth how long we waited for it. Throughout the time we were there, at least five more tables were seated, served, and cleared. The wait staff chatted with each other, occasionally glancing over at us, but generally seemed disinterested and amateur. Trendy or not, good reviews or not, this was a horrendous experience. For the rest of our stay in Madrid, we didn't bother making reservations and stopped into random places. Sometimes that's the best way to experience a new city. Maybe our experience was a one-off or maybe we failed to adapt to Spanish standards of service, but this place missed on every level.",2016-10-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10358028-Reviews-or1180-Inclan_Brutal_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_14246,0.097,0.852,0.051,-0.9391,0.0228176652892561,0.4729338842975207,0.317825,1562,132,0.0845070422535211,2,42,False,70,0.1063829787234042,0.1063829787234042,0.2765957446808511,0.0851063829787234,0.1914893617021276,0.0212765957446808,0.0425531914893617,0.0212765957446808,0.1276595744680851,0.0212765957446808,286,184,4.465034965034965,0,0,qualiti food atmospher stop dire dine experi ever life reserv show although one person serv bar three floor ignor us nearli minut grow line peopl behind us despit waiter hustl around place refus even pick eye see anybodi might want find tabl final seat took anoth minut even get waiter attent take order order everyth becom evid go bit ordeal took anoth minut wife drink show mine show anoth minut took minut one cocktail food show food tasti though slightli cold certainli worth long wait throughout time least five tabl seat serv clear wait staff chat occasion glanc us gener seem disinterest amateur trendi good review horrend experi rest stay madrid bother make reserv stop random place sometim best way experi new citi mayb experi one mayb fail adapt spanish standard servic place miss everi level,very bad review,1

On the one hand, the food and drinks are very tasty and very reasonably priced, and they are served by very competent and friendly staff in a comfortable environment: so that's all good.

Clearly, they're marketing to tourists with that strategy.) I think the tastes are relatively authentic -- it's sort of a modern, lighter spin on some classic Spanish dishes -- and the food is tasty, but it feels a bit like going to a slightly Disneyland-esque recreation of a Spanish tapas restaurant.

Since I am a level 6 contributor I don't want to believe that is true but after going to this restaurant it makes me wonder. There is no way this is one of the top restaurants in Madrid.  I made reservations at this restaurant through the TripAdvisor app for Saturday night. It was strangely empty although The Fork said there were only early bookings available. The service was spotty and the food was mediocre. We had the paella which was bland. The sangria tasted like old wine with some ice cubes thrown into it. The burrata infused with pesto was a huge ball of cheese with 3 cherry tomotaoes. It needed more tomatoes to balance out the cheese. The tuna was loaded down in a heavy sauce and even so didn't have much flavor. I saw mostly tourists at the restaurant probably people who read about it on TA. This place is fine if you are starving and stumble into the restaurant. Definitely don't plan an evening around it.,2016-10-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10358028-Reviews-or1170-Inclan_Brutal_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_14295,0.08,0.84,0.079,0.2115,0.1274691358024691,0.520679012345679,0.2910538461538461,996,92,0.0923694779116465,0,18,False,34,0.0952380952380952,0.0952380952380952,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1904761904761904,0.0,183,136,4.442622950819672,0,0,often hear peopl trust ta rig sinc level contributor want believ true go restaur make wonder way one top restaur madrid made reserv restaur tripadvisor app saturday night strang empti although fork said earli book avail servic spotti food mediocr paella bland sangria tast like old wine ice cube thrown burrata infus pesto huge ball chees cherri tomotao need tomato balanc chees tuna load heavi sauc even much flavor saw mostli tourist restaur probabl peopl read ta place fine starv stumbl restaur definit plan even around,bad review,2

Very limited seating but don't let a full house appearance stop you from wandering in.You'd be surprised where they can fit you. You can sit at the Bar or at a table. Not your usual dim candle lit ambience steak house. It feels more like a fast food burger joint. But the food is another story. After ordering my meal a bowl of fresh popcorn was placed on my table which I wasn't charged for. Nice! My starter was chorizo sausage. Served on it's own with no dressings. Delicious! A fresh bread roll arrived with this. The steak was amazing. Black Angus medium with fries. My Red Wine was Tinto De La Casa. I had Ice Cream for dessert and was given a free lemon liqueur to finish.

On our first visit, we didn’t expect much as we were right in the centre of the shopping madness. Opened the door and saw how small the place was. A young (to us seniors) man gave us a big smile and welcomed us. He had one table empty. He introduced himself and explained the menu. Can you believe a 3 course meal with a glass of wine for 10€? Well, I’m so happy we tried it.  Throughout the menu, he would stop at the table and chat a little. It was obvious he took servicing clients seriously. He answered all our questions and gave us recommendations. My husband and I ordered the same. The chorizo was very nicely spiced. The ribs, the cut unlike what I am accustomed to in Canada, was very tender and the ice cream,... oh, the red wine served in a big wine glass also tasted great. He made us feel at home. So much so that we returned the following night. He immediately recognized us and seemed genuinely happy to see us again. He impressed me again as he remembered what changes, or not, we made to our order the night before. I was surprised to find out later that he took our orders but was not serving our table that night. He laughed and told this evening’s waiter “ these are my friends. Be nice”. The food was as delicious and I wished I had discovered Emu earlier on in our visit to beautiful Madrid.

The setting is simple (not intimate) but don't let that worry you on what you get in the service or food quality. The service is really attentive and quick (in fact a little too much at one point when they tried to clear our plates whilst still eating).  Along with many others we opted for the 10 Euro meal deal. The food was really tasty and the steak was a really good cut of meat and cooked perfect. To get 3 courses including a steak meal amongst hundreds of other expensive places in Madrid seems to be a great marketing approach. With the meal bread was included where other restaurants charge - and we even got a tasty shot at the end and sweets whilst we settled the bill. All small touches which prove if they can do it for 10 Euro what prevents other restaurants doing the same? Would happily make a return visit. ,2017-09-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d9455140-Reviews-or340-Mu_El_Placer_De_La_Carne-Madrid.html,UID_14466,0.016,0.821,0.163,0.985,0.1531084656084656,0.5013983371126228,0.337925,926,74,0.079913606911447,0,15,False,50,0.1224489795918367,0.1632653061224489,0.3061224489795918,0.0612244897959183,0.1632653061224489,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0408163265306122,0.0816326530612244,0.0408163265306122,171,121,4.409356725146199,0,0,locat side street restaur small could accommod us without reserv set simpl intim let worri get servic food qualiti servic realli attent quick fact littl much one point tri clear plate whilst still eat along mani other opt euro meal deal food realli tasti steak realli good cut meat cook perfect get cours includ steak meal amongst hundr expens place madrid seem great market approach meal bread includ restaur charg even got tasti shot end sweet whilst settl bill small touch prove euro prevent restaur would happili make return visit,good review,4

Every time we walked by it was really busy, spotting a window table and needing lunch before flying home we popped in, it was busy. The waiter offered us a bigger table which in hindsight we should have taken, instead we sat at a table for two in the window, which became a squeeze the longer we were there. The service was great throughout , and the guy spoke excellent english putting my limited Spanish to shame. We chose a chicken Caesar salad to share, it was really tasty and delicious, we had time to enjoy before the main courses arrived. Seafood paella and solomillo with goats cheese. The paella wasn’t amazing ,the seafood a little over cooked but still very filling. The steak looked excellent and was very popular a large filling portion this was off of the specials menu.

Ask for him if you go, you will NOT be disappointed in the service. I started with a white sangria. I think an angel came down from Heaven to deliver this drink. It was so good, and I'm not a sangria person. So good. So, dinner started out on a really great note. Well, it only got better. I had the shredded beef (Ropa). Oh my god, this melted in my mouth. If you dine here and miss this dish, you are doing yourself a disservice.  From there I had the succulent shrimp in a butter/garlic sauce that I'm not embarrassed to admit I would've sipped from the bowl. How good you ask? THAT GOOD! I proceeded to have a red sangria that was just as Heavenly(I'm leaning towards the white as my favorite), and finished with some beef tenderloins.

Nothing like this 5 star posh restaurant but the food was cooked with love and tradition. This little small restaurant will surprise you with food that you would die for. It is one of those place that you have to visit and experience. A bottle of wine starter, main, dessert 3 different Spirits all included €40 per person but I booked on the fork 30% off. One thing to warn is that it is a lot of food so you may want to have a very little light breakfast or lunch. We went there for lunch.

The husband and wife owners speak no English.  There is no menu. You have a tasting menu of manchegan dishes which are explained by the wife in Spanish so it can be a bit of a surprise when the dish arrives. There are two dishes based on bacalao which some of our party found a bit too fishy for them. The main dish was quail in a chocolate sauce. Red wine was served from a pitcher but little if any white wine available. Three local spirits provided with coffee. Cost per head was €40 but got a 30% discount by booking on the fork app. A memorable evening of 6 or 7 dishes. ,2016-07-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697567-Reviews-El_Tormo-Madrid.html,UID_14555,0.022,0.939,0.039,0.34,0.1208333333333333,0.2606060606060606,0.2449199999999999,725,69,0.0951724137931034,0,12,False,31,0.1379310344827586,0.2413793103448276,0.2758620689655172,0.1034482758620689,0.1379310344827586,0.0,0.0,0.0689655172413793,0.0344827586206896,0.0,140,103,4.171428571428572,0,0,found restaur first even madrid close hotel unpreposses door knock gain entranc husband wife owner speak english menu tast menu manchegan dish explain wife spanish bit surpris dish arriv two dish base bacalao parti found bit fishi main dish quail chocol sauc red wine serv pitcher littl white wine avail three local spirit provid coffe cost per head got discount book fork app memor even dish,good review,4

We thought we'd uncovered a hidden gem - so imagine our surprise when we came to this site to review Taberna - it was already so highly rated and no wonder why. The seafood risotto was amazing, the chicken curry was a delight to our 8 year old, and the croquettas were wonderful. But none of those topped the grilled octopus which had just the PERFECT amount of chipotle to add a nice spicy note without overwhelming the taste of the octopus. Our 10 year old gave it 5 stars. :) The service was terrific. They treated us as if we were long absent friends, welcomed us with warmth, made sure our every need was looked after and wowed our kids with their friendliness.
