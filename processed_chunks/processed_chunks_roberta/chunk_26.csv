I had three lovely visits in the past, and I even left a very positive review on TripAdvisor in May. However, when I visited in late May, we ordered the paella de mariscos. I got absolutely horrible food poisoning and threw up for almost a whole day, causing me to miss work. My friend who was flying back to the U.S. also got food poisoning and had a miserable flight back home. I know that nothing else I'd eaten in the day before could have caused this food poisoning. The restaurant emailed me asking for general feedback after my meal and I explained what happened and never heard anything back from them. I found the lack of response very unprofessional.

When we arrived, I was wearing a dark blazer and slacks and they asked me to wear a tie. (My wife looked great and passed inspection.) But I was secretly pleased. A demanding classicism, I thought. How cool. But it was not to be. The restaurant is leather banquets and linen tablecloths. Nice but unimaginative place settings. Modest art. An older (largely +50) clientele. So we fit right in. Service throughout was polite but incredibly impersonal and in one case, bad. More on that to come.  The amuse bouche was embarrassing. nothing more than a potato puff.  My wife's prawn salad was tasteless and covered in mayonnaise. Beyond dull. My ravioli with mushrooms and a (very) little fois gras in a cream sauce was actually tasty. Traditional, but refreshing in that regard. I ordered baby lamb rare. My wife had the roast chicken. When my lamb arrived, it was a dull gray. I remarked on that and was told that it was baby lamb and should never be served rare. That may be so, but someone could have said that to me. The lamb was decent, but no one on the wait staff ever came back to inquire if I was satisfied. It bordered on rude. My wife's chicken was fine, but nothing that either of us couldn't have roasted in a heartbeat.  But it was the vegetables that accompanied the main courses that were totally unacceptable: cold, overcooked, tasteless. Frankly, embarrassing if they had come from an institutional buffet. The desserts were so poorly translated on the menu (no one in the restaurant spoke much English) that we ordered ice cream to be safe. Again, okay but so unimaginatively presented.

There was a somewhat formal atmosphere, spoiled by the executive with a young woman in an excessively revealing dress. We had dinner in the main hall, with some very bad modern paintings hanging on the walls and a very tacky table centerpiece (quite hideous: a silver basket with apples and a green plant emerging from it) that we quickly set aside.  The Chefs de Salle had the looks of old hands of the Franco regime and were quite rude in making comments between themselves and with the waiters regarding our choice of menu and wine, even after we told them we understood Spanish quite well. I was surprised by the fact that the menu they offered my wife included prices (something I did not expect from such a formal restaurant). In contrast, the sommelier as well as the waiters were professional and efficient. The real disappointment was the food. Excellent ingredients spoiled by bad concepts and a quality of execution that was far bellow par for such a restaurant. We started with the lobster salad. The lobster was overcooked, giving it a rubbery texture. It was accompanied by a heavy sauce that completely overwhelmed the shelfish: not the Sherry vinegar dressing advertised in the menu... It made me ask: what's the point? In a few bites I tasted the glory of the lobster, but too little and only after trying to clean the sauce off! For the entrees we chose fish. I had the grouper (""Mero a la plancha com emulsion de vinagreta de marisco""). The fish was excellent but the dish was badly executed: the top was beautifully grilled but was simply too salty. As for the inner part of the fish, it basically had no salt at all. As for the sauce, It was bland and added nothing to the dish.  My wife had the sole fillets with soya and Kenyan bean sauce. Not the best concept: the sole was overcooked (she didn't eat more than a quarter of the portion), and the sauce was just too heavy for the fish.  Wondering what they couldn't ruin, we finished with a raspberry sorbet. That was excellent, as were the sweets served with coffee.

I am passionate about food and I also work in the food service in London and when accidentally I found myself sat in this bar I once again re-assure myself the God exists. Ylenia is a fantastic Italian young lady (I think she owns the place with her husband) with lot of enthusiasm, very smiley, attentive to your needs and with an accurate knowledge of all the products, ingredients, brands, make of the menu (she would even give you the recipe if you ask). They have several kinds of fresh pasta which can be matched with different sauces that make your mouth water. Well, I decided to have ravioli made with goat cheese and figs and also because I am not really friend with diets and I love carbohydrates I opt for another portion of ravioli but this time with burrata. OMG. DELICIOUS. I did not have anymore room on my belly but I was tempted in having also ravioli with artichokes or ricotta cheese and spinach or cheese and pears etc... I also had the pleasure to meet and chat with Chef Boja - very popular in Spain - looks after every single dish before comes out from the kitchen. Please don't you dare to leave without having had a Tiramisu - this is special. Great perfumes, aromas and atmosphere. It is a must go place.  I hope you will soon launch a Pasta Mito in London.

It opens at 8 and is full by 8:30. The tapas are fantastic. We started with the excellent pork on carmelized onions on toast, then the mains of squid wrapped in ham with a mousse of ink and the stewed ox tail and potato. The squid dish was large enough to serve four people. The ox tail dish, which was touted in the French guide Le Routard, was fabulous. The staff spoke some English, but more importantly the menu was in English, French, Italian and Spanish, which is a real help for some of the more obscure tapas dishes. The wine selection was very good and even the lowest priced red was quite good. Staff were friendly and professional. The only downsides to this place are that it is modern and doesn't have that traditional tapas bar look, there are too few tables, and the wooden seats are uncomfortable. But the food makes up for any discomfort. The modern music was a little annoying at first, but as soon as the place filled up around 8:30, you could no longer hear it.",2012-03-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1822624-Reviews-or450-Casa_Lucas-Madrid.html,UID_22974,0.079,0.801,0.12,0.8795,0.1562289915966386,0.4453501400560224,0.3016818181818182,1026,96,0.0935672514619883,0,26,False,40,0.0697674418604651,0.1627906976744186,0.2790697674418604,0.0465116279069767,0.2093023255813953,0.0232558139534883,0.0,0.0,0.1395348837209302,0.0697674418604651,192,129,4.348958333333333,0,0,get earli get one tabl open full tapa fantast start excel pork carmel onion toast main squid wrap ham mouss ink stew ox tail potato squid dish larg enough serv four peopl ox tail dish tout french guid le routard fabul staff spoke english importantli menu english french italian spanish real help obscur tapa dish wine select good even lowest price red quit good staff friendli profession downsid place modern tradit tapa bar look tabl wooden seat uncomfort food make discomfort modern music littl annoy first soon place fill around could longer hear,good review,4

The interior is nicely decorated and we found the staff polite and attentive. Their wine is good, as is the paella mariscos. Along with paella, we ordered the argentinian steak, rare, and I wasn't very happy with it. I found it lacked taste and it was nearly cold when it reached our table. Also, the patatas fritas that come with the steak are below par. Generally, if you are nearby and want to grab something to eat, this place is fine. The food won't be top quality, it won't be something you'll remember, but it's fine for a meal. The offputting factor should be the price. Two paellas, a steak and wine for three people comes to around 86 euros. We ate in other places in Barcelona, Madrid, Granada and Malaga, had a better experience and for less money so take that into account.

A local advised us to book a table in advance and this is advice that I would pass along to anyone interested in securing a table at Casa Lucas as the dining area is limited. The food and the service were consistently top-notch. Two of the gentlemen working in the dining room spoke perfect English and the menu is available in a number of languages.

The waitress didn't speak any English. It's very hard to communicate. After we ordered, they put two cold breads on our plate (each costs 1.9 €) without even asking if we wanted it.  What really motivates me to write this review is a repeated charge in our bill. The menu clearly indicates that 10% VAT(value added tax) is included in the price. However, when we got the bill, another 10% of IVA/VAT was added, with no explanation. Because of language barrier, we cannot get an answer but have to pay the bill (The waitress just waved her hand and said no English). When we dine in neighborhood restaurants, 10% VAT is also included in menu price, and no other unexpected price is added at the total bill.  If I am not mistaken, we are charged TWICE on sales tax, 20% of total value. I'm not happy with this dishonest hidden charge.

We shared baked cheese and a dish of anchovies for appetizers and paella with duck and mushrooms for mains. Everything was delicious!

The ambiance of the restaurant is modern, simple and with a homey feeling. All the waiters have been working there for a long time now, and the menu remains very much the same. There are 3 types of Rice served at Marina Ventura: Dry Rice, also known as Paella; Meloso Rice (quite moist), and Caldoso Rice (soupy seafood rice served in a cauldron). We have tried all three types of rice and cant really say which is one is best than the other. There are also many other items in the menu, but when in Spain, eating their rice cooking is a must. Prices are moderate and wine selection is outstanding, with moderate prices too.

Unfortunately, it really did not live up to them. It has parted away from the traditional and tried to move to a modern look, but has failed to achieve that.  On the food side (forgot to take pictures again), one can say it is decent but does not have that extra touch that it did before. The service has come done tremendously and they seem to be lost in what they are doing.

There are no gastronomical gimmicks at Zalacain. It’s traditional cooking using seasonal ingredients where you can easily over indulge as we did. As our Spanish hosts had been there several times, they ordered a variety appetizers for the table from goose liver pate with quince jam to clams in a bean sauce with quail eggs. Our host insisted we try the minced pigs trotters that were surprisingly superb. The bread is the one thing that was disappointing as we felt it should have been freshly baked.  The main courses did not disappoint as each of our party ordered a different main course ranging from a beautiful, though heavy, stew of red-legged partridge with chickpeas, steamed sea bass, beef steak in red wine, sirloin with fresh goose liver, and a steak tartar that had the perfect level of spice. All delicious.  To finish our meal we had some perfectly made paper thin traditional Almond roof tiles and mignardises, complemented with a sexy sweet wine, Alvear PX 1927, with beautiful roasted tones.

Some of us already knew this restaurant, not myself. I can tell you that it was spectacular in terms of food, atmosphere, etc. The price was a little bit high, probably, but the quality of the food deserves it. The service was very attentive, for us it wasn't slow at all. Special thanks to José Ynglada: Olé maestro! Your breafing at the beginning of the dinner captivated us! We want for tomates (even in late winter!), alcachofas (a must), sardina ahumada (great discovery), pulpo a la gallega (we expected a little bit more) and then different dishes of tuna fish. I would recommend dados de atún picante, tiraditos de atún and morillo de atún a la brasa. It's also highly recommendable to finish with a dessert, just to try it, go for tarta fina de manzana. One of the best I've ever tried. All in all, very nice restaurant, service very attentive, extremely good food, great José Ynglada and from time to time I guess all of us can afford a restaurant like this one.

We had tapas as a starter (of course) and that was just excellent. One dish was a big and thick slice tomatoe with oil and that was just amazing. The taste was just like a sun warm freshly picked tomatoe in Italy but with a crisper texture. Serrano ham and croquettes etc. was really good and to that a fresh and good wine. For main course we got a sirloin steak cooked to perfection. Staff is active and attentive, arriving well timed to the table for refill of glasses. Professional, but would benefit from being slightly more personal according to me. It is expensive, so with a slightly lower price level it would be world class.

It was a bit far from our hotel but decided to take a taxi and go...turned out to be a great decision. We are all vegetarians and had specified it while making a reservation, they were happy to accommodate. The menu was very simple, all we had to do was decide how many courses, everything else was left to the chef, and with good reason. Every dish tasted fresh, delicious and had a modern spin to it. It was all created for us rather than modify a meat dish, which is what many other restaurants tend to do. The ""carpaccio of zucchini"" was memorable. The desserts were fantastic. The ""choccomisu"" was a delicious take on Tiramisu and their cheesecake redefined what a cheese cake ought to be. Not a single mediocre dish. Above all , the service was friendly, hospitable and attentive. All of them came across as enjoying what they do, cared about us like we were a part of the family and made it a truly enjoyable experience. Prices were reasonable and it was an unforgettable experience. We will go there anytime we are in Madrid.

It is not located in the city center, but it worths going out of the Madrilonian hectic traffic and tourists traps for a while and know a bit of the surroundings of the city. The place started as a very small tavern several years ago and grew to its current size, still moderately small and without losing a piece of its quality. The tavern is divided in two spaces, the bar and tavern (where you can eat tapas) and a small restaurant (with more elaborated food) just in front of the kitchen. The food is excellent, a mix between the best traditional madrilonian tapas and the creativity of Bahia chefs (including Italian heritage), which makes it a delicious combination. Not to miss the ""pizza de chipirones"" (squid pizza) or a slightly truffeled-mashed potato with a low-temperature boiled egg (just delicious). These are my favourites, and I ask them every time I go. The quality of food is very good, and the chefs introduce new dishes every once in a while. All combined with a good selection of wines and beers and possibility of cocktails before or after de meal.  The staff is friendly and knows about wines that maridate well with the food. Best of all, the prizes are quite low, particularly if you compare them with other restaurants or taverns in the city center.  It is better to book in advance if you want to eat in the restaurant. Otherwise, staying in the bar area is fun. Sundays can be a bit busier, because of the traditional madrilonian aperitivo, which is quite an experience!",2014-11-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d803211-Reviews-or70-Bahia_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_23080,0.01,0.794,0.196,0.9964,0.2796678321678322,0.4511363636363636,0.3072769230769231,1545,134,0.0867313915857605,1,40,False,62,0.1290322580645161,0.1935483870967742,0.3225806451612903,0.0483870967741935,0.1774193548387097,0.0161290322580645,0.0,0.0161290322580645,0.0806451612903225,0.0161290322580645,275,168,4.614545454545454,0,0,visit place everi time go madrid locat citi center worth go madrilonian hectic traffic tourist trap know bit surround citi place start small tavern sever year ago grew current size still moder small without lose piec qualiti tavern divid two space bar tavern eat tapa small restaur elabor food front kitchen food excel mix best tradit madrilonian tapa creativ bahia chef includ italian heritag make delici combin miss pizza de chipiron squid pizza slightli truffel mash potato low temperatur boil egg delici favourit ask everi time go qualiti food good chef introduc new dish everi combin good select wine beer possibl cocktail de meal staff friendli know wine marid well food best prize quit low particularli compar restaur tavern citi center better book advanc want eat restaur otherwis stay bar area fun sunday bit busier tradit madrilonian aperitivo quit experi,good review,4

But fear not, it is easily accessible by Metro (Barajas station) and one bus in a southward direction. I walked from my pre-flight hotel in downtown Barajas. On to the meal. As others did, I ordered the tasting menu and shared a liking of seafood with waiter Miguel, who speaks excellent English. What ensued was a feast of 8-10 small- and medium-sized dishes (I lost count in my bliss.), each beautifully presented, each a wonderful melange of tastes. I have never had a meal like this.  I was not initially aware of this, but the person bringing the food to the table and explaining it in great detail was the chef and owner himself, Daniel Vangoni. He is very approachable, speaks excellent English, and seems to get great enjoyment performing anonymously -- no toque for this chef -- to the delight of his clients.  It has been said by others, but I found this the best restaurant during my week´s stay in Madrid, and possibly in my life. That it cost less than 50 euros, including 3 glasses of wine, makes it a remarkable value as well.  Please do yourself a favor and make the surprising easy trek to this gem of a restaurant.

Our dining at Bahia Taberna will join that select group. Specifically, the restaurant is divided into two parts.The front area with the bar is more for typical drinking and tapas at tables. The back room is ""white table cloth"" primarily for full dinners, although they too are build around tapas. Most diners were savoring the ""tasting menu"" which consists of perhaps eight consecutive small portions which are updated frequently by the chef-owner. These are not the strange ""vertical structures"" that some chefs are so proud of and are mysteries to most diners, but are remarkably creative and absolutely delicious. You can order off of the full menu, but go with the best and order the tasting menu. The server told us that whenever we felt that we had enough, he could stop the flow.

I have coeliac disease which means I cannot have gluten, my mum who I was with doesn't. The chef came over and told us he would create a tasting menu for us and I would have different options to make sure it was gluten free. He double checked what we did and didn't like. The restaurant area is in the back of a small bar, it only has around 6 or 7 tables and you can see into the kitchen. At first the bar area seemed more appealing atmosphere wise but as the restaurant filled up it got better. The food was wonderful - even the onions and brussel sprout appetisers were great! We had around 6 courses including scallop with bacon, courgette stuffed with gorgonzola and shrimp, egg with truffle, tuna tartare etc etc. This isn't traditional Spanish cuisine but the meal was varied, well balanced and surprising. The staff were extremely warm and accommodating. For the quality of the food the price was very good - around 70 euros a head with a bottle of wine and a sherry.

So in an unlikely night, in an unlikely location close to the airport, I discovered the best restaurant in Madrid. I still can't believe that I've lived over 3 years in this town without ever having heard of this restaurant! And you wouldn't know it when you enter the place. As you enter, it looks cool, with some walls inexplicably hanging pictures from Tintin ¿? The the waiter comes. He looked like the typical Spanish waiter. But this young fellow wasn't hurried, and he seemed friendlier. We were a party of around 12, representing around 5 different nationalities, and he made the effort to expalin the options to everyone. Then the food came. And only at that moment you realize you are dining in a very special place. Different tapas and other dishes kept coming one after the other, each one as great as the previous one. Everyone in the group was just dazzled! I'd really love to keep this place as a ""hidden jewel"". However, through the years I've got so many times such valuable guidance from fellow Tripadvisor reviewers, that I feel I'm obliged to share this experience. A few days later I returned with my family, as it ocassionally happens that ones tends to idealize an experience. But this was not the case. They delivered good consistent service, and the best, most creative, tastiest food you could have.  You gotta try it. Don't be put off by the location, it's just a 10 minute ride from downtown, and a 5 minute ride from Barajas airport (if you happen to have a couple of hours to spare in the city). Finally, about the price: This place IS NOT cheap.",2013-03-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d803211-Reviews-or120-Bahia_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_23098,0.003,0.831,0.166,0.9957,0.1207539682539682,0.4997619047619047,0.3584545454545455,1685,143,0.0848664688427299,2,57,False,57,0.175438596491228,0.1228070175438596,0.2982456140350877,0.0350877192982456,0.1578947368421052,0.0175438596491228,0.0175438596491228,0.0350877192982456,0.087719298245614,0.0526315789473684,301,207,4.598006644518272,0,0,serendip word raini night attend busi dinner busi usual thought unlik night unlik locat close airport discov best restaur madrid still believ live year town without ever heard restaur know enter place enter look cool wall inexplic hang pictur tintin waiter come look like typic spanish waiter young fellow hurri seem friendlier parti around repres around differ nation made effort expalin option everyon food came moment realiz dine special place differ tapa dish kept come one one great previou one everyon group dazzl realli love keep place hidden jewel howev year got mani time valuabl guidanc fellow tripadvisor review feel oblig share experi day later return famili ocassion happen one tend ideal experi case deliv good consist servic best creativ tastiest food could gotta tri put locat minut ride downtown minut ride baraja airport happen coupl hour spare citi final price place cheap,good review,4

If you want that - then do yourself a favour and go to the Bahia Taberna. I took my partner for his birthday dinner and was we were blown away. Yes, the taxi cost a little bit more than a small trip to the centre of town, but given the quality, quantity and extraordinary value, why worry about a few euros more?? We had the degustacion menu - a tasting menu - which was simply sublime. Two appetisers and then the most amazing experience, whereby the chef came out and introduced virtually all of the plates. The flavour, ambience and discourse was utterly superb. If there is something that you really don't like (in our case, prawns and mushrooms), then a pre-amble will ensure you don't get what you don't want. Cool, chic, relaxed. If you want great taste, without the pretension, then seek out this first-class restaurant and bar. My thanks to Bea(trice) and all of the staff for making this the best dining experience I've had in many a year. When I emailed the restaurant from Scotland, I got a reply within seconds and a phone call not long after. Customer service which is second to none, food to write home about (and try to emulate at home) and a real sense of being part of an extended family make this the idea stop in Madrid. Think tapas with a European twist, and you won't go far wrong. Banana bread topped with love and loveliness, monkfish which is far from being in the monastery and steak ravioli which reminds us (at least) of the lightest of steak pies. Oh, and desserts which have no equal. Go. Enjoy. And go again. You. Will. Love. It. Muy muchas gracias Bea y Bahia. Mucho gusto y espero comer otra mas!!!

In this case, I was flat out wrong. The eating area has no more than 6 tables and it looks pretty uninteresting. However, the experience was wonderful. We went there for lunch and ordered the menu degustación, a total of 5 dishes between appetizers, entrees and desert. The winners were the pizza of chipirones (little calamari) and the ravioli of rabo de toro (bull's tail), but everything was delicious. The service was also very good.

We were about the only ones in when we arrived for lunch at 1.30pm but within minutes the place was full and people were being turned away. The owner couldn't have been more friendly when he showed us our table and the great service continued throughout by all members of staff. We went for the great value Daily Menu and it was so tasty, particularly the risotto starter (huge portion). The house wine that came with it was excellent and we ordered a second glass each. Despite being really busy we were never rushed, even though there was a queue forming outside. We enjoyed it so much that after we left we booked online for dinner later in the week. Again, our welcome was so friendly and I was called by my first name throughout by the owner as if I was a regular. They really appreciate repeat business and make you feel very welcome. My wife had the fillet mignon as her main course and it was a massive piece of meat, cooked to perfection. I had the excellent octopus dish.

After a couple of hours from landing and checking into a small hostel I wandered around and feeling the need for an espresso popped into this restaurant. The smell of food made me hungry, so I ended up having a meal. Cost was Euro40 and for main courses the last of which I struggled to eat half, because by then I was well and truly stuffed. There were a couple of tiny snacky things and then the first plate of foie gras on toasted banana bread, wow what an amazing combination. This was followed by baby squid on bread with pesto and other tasty sauces. third plate was sashimi salmon and by the time I finished this I was really ready for my coffee and a snooze, but the final plate of slow cooked lamb, shredded and formed into a small brick with hoisin sauce. I barely ate half of it and was finished, although I did have a double espresso, but no dessert. The staff were very helpful and the chefs even served a couple of the dishes explaining in their ""English"" what was in each dish.

So after reading the reviews we decided this was the place to go. There were 6 of us in the group and we didn't make a booking, so we got lucky that they had room for us. Once inside we were advised that the restaurant was not going to be open for another 30 minutes. Not a problem, take a seat in the bar area and relax.  The restaurant itself is small but I like the fact that the kitchen is literally right there. You can see all of the goings on in the kitchen and the plating up at the pass. Menu's are set in old vinyl style records. But really you don't need a menu as all the courses are made on the day depending on the produce they get in. The menu is really asking what type of degustation you want. Starters consisted of a Cauliflower and then a ginger Vichyssoise. The cauliflower was ok but the Vichyssoise was excellent. 1st course was scallops. These weren't overcooked and chewy rather soft and melt in the mouth style and sat beautifully on a lovely granite style brick. Great creativity. 2nd course was a baby squid pizza. Some in the group were not keen at the description but were blown away when it came out. Not a scrap was left on any of the plates, 3rd course was monkfish that was sublime. Softly cooked with beautiful flavours. The best dish I experienced all night. A standout. 4th course was Lamb. Once again it just fell apart it was cooked so wonderfully. Desert was cheesecake followed by a chocolate mousse. Once again absolutely beautiful. And to top it off a chocolate truffle. The chef was absolutely fantastic. He also took our orders and described everything that was made. Outgoing personality, not pretentious in anyway at all.

As a result, I got sick during the night after my visit to the restaurant! 3) The beef was totally raw, and we had to send it back. 4) The waitress managed to spill the bottle of wine over my friend and her jacket (and the woman at the next table). 5) There was a dead COCKROACH under our table. This was spotted and removed by the owner, as he was cleaning up the wine on the floor after spilling it. AND in the end, we were rudely asked to leave, becuse they needed the table for other guests! I have never in my life had an worse restaurant experiance, and I do want to point out, that we were never rude or complained loudly.

The Marina Ventura proved to be much more. We went on a Sunday for lunch and were lucky to make reservations as when we arrived they were not able to take care of what seemed to be regular clients without reservations. We arrived at 1,30 pm and after 2,20 pm the place was packed although the setup of tables at the restaurant does not make you feel in a crowded place. Very nice looking, modern restaurant with very professional service located at Barrio de las Letras, a short walk from the Sevilla Metro Station. We had baked cheese with caramelised onions for start. It is composed of baked goat and brie cheeses which are just delicious.Two very generous portions of each cheese for 13.5 Euros.  We then had the Arroz mixto Señoret. A great paella rice for those who do not like peeling hot seafood with your hands at the table. The rice was cooked to perfection with generous amounts of seafood, chicken and pork, all for a very reasonable 17 Euros per person. We also had a bottle of albarino for 18 Euros. In short we had a memorable lunch at a great location with very professional service for a very reasonable price.

Luckily for us, we stumbled onto an absolutely wonderful restaurant. We took the degustacion menu and were totally amazed at the creativity, subtlety of the food and its preparation. Each course was outstanding and so attentively served that we were totally astounded and, of course, delighted. If you have to spend the night near Barajas Airport, as we did, this is a wonderful opportunity for fine dining.   The restaurant itself is small and not especially fancy, though they have a small area set up with the full linens and plates of a fancy restaurant. You can see the chefs at work.

We returned for lunch at the restaurant on our penultimate day. Our hotel recommended this restaurant for paella. Despite being recommended by our hotel, it was thankfully not a tourist trap.  We ordered paella Valenciana and grilled vegetables for takeaway. It was alright but we found that it had too many Lima beans overpowering the flavor of the rice and chicken. When we returned for lunch with a larger group, we ordered arroz negro (with squid) and arroz campero (with chicken, rabbit, etc) along with lamb (chuletitas de cordero) and chopitos (fried squid). We shared a pitcher of sangria. The paellas were excellent, especially the arroz negro. The chopitos were delicious as well, and the lamb chops were quite tasty. Service was good, with the waiter speaking good English. It should be noted however that one waitress became particularly snarky simply because I called her señora rather than señorita when I was trying to speak a bit of Spanish. This waitress avoided eye contact with me throughout the rest of our stay at the restaurant. The ambience of the restaurant is classy and cozy, and yet quite spacious.

We have been served a sea-food paella for 4 people. There were only 5 slices of calamari, a few tiny prawns (not king prawns as in the photos) that were almost impossible to find inside the paella and 8 pieces of unshelled mussels. Yes, you heard me right! It had nothing to do with the photos full of shelled mussels, king prawns and calamari. We could barely see sea food inside our paella. Plus, rice was undercooked that we could not eat it. It was definitely the worst paella I have had in Spain and I am counting the fast-food style paella places into this!!! We had a calamari, a paella for 4 people, 1 bottle of water and 4 soft drinks for our dinner and paid 35 euros each (140 total). I strongly recommend you to try somewhere else if you want to have sea food paella with real and visible sea food in it. I guess the number of sea food will be more than the number of fingers in one hand when you pay an amount similar to ours!!!

The paellas are for a minimum of two people and you're told that as its cooked fresh it will take around 30-40 minutes to arrive. We ordered some bread to start with, along with a bottle of cava, while waiting for the paella. We were served a large warm bread roll each along with some soft cheese with a little pesto which was very tasty.  The paella seemed to be ready quicker than expected and was really tasty.

In these 5 years, I have seen Chef Dani and his team excel, day by day. I have never repeated dishes across seasons, except for the classics that the locals request to stay in the menu. With very deep Italian background and high dominance of the technique, Dani has created a universe of single plate gourmet tapas with a very recognizable identity. Sashimis, tartars, slow cooked meats and an abundance of warm and cold seasons veggies including a landmark gazpacho are the must haves. Depending on how hungry you are, Dani will propose you a 3 to 7 tapas tasting menu that will always be in better price/quality than any other place in Madrid. Make sure you book your table in advance as local business man at lunch time and foreign tourists at dinner normally block the 8 tables in the main room. Also, consider a walk in and enjoy the same menu at their high tables with a signature gin tonic. By far, my favorite place in Madrid, Spain and Europe. They even rewarded my loyalty with a cocktail named by me ""Expresso Karani"" (their own interpretation of the Expresso Martini).",2014-05-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d803211-Reviews-or80-Bahia_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_23169,0.011,0.853,0.135,0.9805,0.1776095238095237,0.4974603174603175,0.3340888888888889,1281,95,0.0741608118657299,0,29,False,46,0.2,0.1555555555555555,0.2888888888888888,0.0444444444444444,0.1777777777777777,0.0,0.0222222222222222,0.0222222222222222,0.0888888888888888,0.0,230,166,4.573913043478261,0,0,almost sinc open year ago monthli visitor bahia taberna far best place near airport madrid worth wile min taxi drive downtown madrid year seen chef dani team excel day day never repeat dish across season except classic local request stay menu deep italian background high domin techniqu dani creat univers singl plate gourmet tapa recogniz ident sashimi tartar slow cook meat abund warm cold season veggi includ landmark gazpacho must have depend hungri dani propos tapa tast menu alway better price qualiti place madrid make sure book tabl advanc local busi man lunch time foreign tourist dinner normal block tabl main room also consid walk enjoy menu high tabl signatur gin tonic far favorit place madrid spain europ even reward loyalti cocktail name expresso karani interpret expresso martini,good review,4

Luckily eating late had us fitting right in in Madrid! We found our way to La Berenjena and grabbed a few empty stools by the door. We ordered from the very nice female bartender, the man I assume spoke very little English because whenever we approached he signaled for her, which was funny because we did tend to order in Spanish. Anyway, she was great and after we ended up moving away from the front to a an area in the back and she came by to recommend some food and wine for me, the boys were drinking the local beer all night. Everything we ordered was great. I wish I had more of an appetite because I would have loved to try more things. But I can say the burrata salad was perfect, the tomatoes were ripe and the truffle oil just right, add some crusty bread and I was very happy. We also split an assortment of croquettes, the mushroom and the leek. The leek were my favorite and I say that as someone obsessed with mushrooms. I forget what the guys ordered but they were happy.

This restaurant surprised all of us with its evident contrast between appearance and quality: it seems to be a mid—low level place where you actually experience something well above even pretty good restaurants.  We took 4 dishes+desserts, where you can taste a broad variety of different foods and preparations, often re-elaborating local dishes (e.g. the baby squid), presented every time in a different way, well served and represented by the waiter. Every bite is an explosion of flavors, not far from my experience in Michelin-starred restaurants. Also some unexpected food is provided as part of the sequence.

We went just after 9pm as suggested because it became very crowded by 10ish and we did not have a reservation. They got us a table for two very quickly and the waiter knew English and had an English menu. The menu is limited but very innovative. Not the average tapas you get at most places like Spanish omelette or chorizo. The highlight was the tomato and goat cheese salad with lovely olive oil and fresh basil. We also had chicken and pork on bread which was lovely. 6 tapas and a couple of glasses of cava came under £50 which was a great bargain.

We were at a big business hotel and eating at such a place seemed a bit sad. We pulled up Tripadvisor and saw that the ""best restaurant"" on the site was just a 4 km cab ride away and so we went for it.  The pictures on Trip Advisor showed a small rather sterile-looking restaurant, but the vibe and contemporary decoration was better than I had expected.  The menu seemed a bit small: perhaps 10 or 15 total choices. And all of the choices were rather exotic, and so it wasn't like we could simply order a paella and know what we were getting. As most people on TA, we went with the ""discovery menu"". Basically, they take 7 or 8 of the menu items and split into two portions.  Everything came quickly and was well presented. We bought a bottle of 20 Euro wine which was excellent. Yep...the chef came out and spoke with us, explaining everything to us in Spanish/French/English.  Really...a good experience and yes...my best meal in Madrid thus far. My only (small) complaint is that my wife and I both agreed that the portions good have been larger. I remember that there were a few courses that consisted of one (single) ""amuse-bouche"" size portion. I realize that this place isn't a trough, but there really was hardly enough to taste. That said, I didn't leave hungry and I've got a good appetite.  The total bill: a few beers, a bottle of wine and two menus came to 100 Euros.

The prices were not shown in the website, but they pointed to ~40 EUR/person, and they were right (including a single glass of wine and dessert). The meal was memorable. The waiter went over the really small menu, and served us a degustation menu, with 4 delicious meals: * One patata brava, literally one, while we waited * Pizza de chipiron -unbelievable. A masterpiece * Zucchini with blue cheese.  and the ones i still think about: * A salmon tartar * Steak tartar The ingredients were all perfect, fresh, combining perfectly. I still think of these plates one month after we had them.  For dessert we had an unbelievable Tiramisu. So tasteful.  We went to a well recommended restaurant (but lower price point) in Seattle just last night. Still thinking about that meal, it made it look like fast food. The restaurant is in an odd neighborhood, very close to the airport but far away from the center. It's worth the trip :-)",2013-01-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d803211-Reviews-or130-Bahia_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_575,0.022,0.724,0.254,0.9977,0.2692780337941628,0.5994623655913979,0.3452,1520,120,0.0789473684210526,0,53,False,79,0.1219512195121951,0.1707317073170731,0.3170731707317073,0.048780487804878,0.1707317073170731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219512195121951,0.048780487804878,270,180,4.622222222222222,0,0,definit one best meal ever life alway lazi write review restaur deserv time dedic rememb great meal servic excel chef come tabl go plate atmospher relax interest hip classi way definit go want fantast gourmet experi stay madrid last night found restaur recommend tripadvisor want go better restaur brother mind splurg one night price shown websit point eur person right includ singl glass wine dessert meal memor waiter went realli small menu serv us degust menu delici meal one patata brava liter one wait pizza de chipiron unbeliev masterpiec zucchini blue chees one still think salmon tartar steak tartar ingredi perfect fresh combin perfectli still think plate one month dessert unbeliev tiramisu tast went well recommend restaur lower price point seattl last night still think meal made look like fast food restaur odd neighborhood close airport far away center worth trip,good review,4

I am delighted to say Bahia Taberan is a fabulous restaurant at which to dine if any where near this area or want to take a jaunt from more central Madrid! It is bright and small and you can reserve ahead of time, which I did pursuant to learning of its excellent reputation. It is a casual and hip atmosphere. There is an option between tall tables and ...covered tables? (not sure precise term)(not sure if they actually were covered). The tall tables are more communal (long so that many can sit at it) and that area gets busy/full as the evening proceeds. If you are having the tasting menu , it is best to perhaps reserve the other tables which are further back from entry door and are in a more restaurant typical arrangement (less communal as separate tables). While the server spoke English, there were still some challenges but I had the short menu and could have changed it to the long and think maybe I should have as frankly, everything was absolutely delicious (I wistfully eyed the dishes of those who did have the long taste menu). But I was full (unfortunately), so just had the short tasting menu (sigh) (still not sure of this decision..ha). I highly recommend this restaurant.

We though it would be a sophisticated tavern judging from the name and looking at the dishes' photos. Ofcourse looking at the location which is off the beaten track away from everything that would be slightly touristic, we though, hmmm...... is this really the place? Given the fact though that its location is a 7-8 minutes taxi ride from the airport we though that it was a no brainer. We took the Metro to the closest stop (Alameda de Osuna) from the line 5 we were on. Then we needed a 15 minute walk to reach the Bahia taberna. Arriving at 20:30 (8:30 pm) we were the first customers (Spanish usually go out to eat after 21:00. We explained that we needed to leave around 22:00 to catch our plane. We expected to be seated in one of the bar-like high tables made of euro-pallets (nice idea and nice ambiance), we finally were seated in one of the few low tables close to the kitchen. Here is were we realized that there was a small variation of the menu and the pricing when seated at the bar-like tables comparing to seating at a normal table. At that point I thought that we would be paying a lot more than expected. Our initial expectation from a taverna was around €20 per person. We thought though giving it a try. We explained that we would prefer having fish and we asked them to feel free and build up the menu for us. We found all the dishes FANTASTIC! What a great combination of great ingredients presented in a Michelin star way. One dish was tastier than the other. The speed of serving was also remarkable having the chef and the waiter worrying more than we did about getting a taxi to the airport and avoiding missing our flight. What a service! We finally ended up paying less than €90 for two persons with a glass of wine and two bottles of water. I truly hope that the prices will be kept in a logical levels and as I said to the chef, please do not get a michelin star even though you worth it. So in a nutshell the service is excellent, the food is sublime and it worth while going away from the center to taste the creations of its chef.

We did not know what to expect, but were put to ease as soon as our tapas arrived. The blood sausage and egg on top of bread was divine! (This particular tapas remained the highlight among all the food that we tasted in our 7 day trip in Spain.) We finally got our table and shared a plate of the oxtail balls which was also very good. We came back the next day and had the Huevos Macarena - egg, cream, veggie, mushroom, and ham casserole. This was very good as well. We highly recommend this place.

It's a tiny, hopping restaurant that was filled with happy people eating and drinking. It's not really a tapas place, they have some as sort of appetizers, but also quite a few entrees.

It had this balsamic and slightly creamy sauce and bacon, and it was by the far the best squid I've ever had. It's also HUGE, we couldn't finish it.

When we first stepped in I had my doubts. It's very small and the waiter seemed a bit inconvenienced to have to sit a group of 3 at a table that seats 5. I get that they are busy and that that means not getting maximum value out of your space, but there was nothing else and we came there to spend, so it was a bit off putting when he sighed and reluctantly sat us. However, after that initial less than warm welcome, we totally enjoyed our visit. The food was AMAZING. It's so creative and unusual. We tried a series of Tostas, One had a corn mouse and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven when I put that in my mouth. They had a really interesting drink menu so we tried the vermouth which is a must, and an interesting sherry wine which was totally new to me.

The menu selection was slightly different from the usual tapas restaurants we had visited around Madrid but the food was very tasty and the service was quick and friendly. When we were there the clientèle almost exclusively consisted of US visitors, and whilst I have no problem with our fellow English speaking friends, it did just feel that we were in a tourist hotspot rather than an authentic Madrilenos favorite. A victim of it's own success of TA, perhaps? The road on which Casa Lucas is situated (Calle Cava Baja) appeared to have many popular restaurants filled with locals and next time I'm in that part of town I will be more inclined to visit one of these alternatives instead; for the experience rather than for want of better food.",2012-08-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1822624-Reviews-or410-Casa_Lucas-Madrid.html,UID_23248,0.014,0.814,0.172,0.9831,0.2958730158730158,0.4780952380952381,0.27505,907,77,0.0848952590959206,0,16,False,37,0.088235294117647,0.1764705882352941,0.3235294117647059,0.0,0.2058823529411764,0.0294117647058823,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0588235294117647,0.0588235294117647,159,118,4.710691823899371,0,0,restaur extrem popular earli dinner spanish standard mani peopl queu bar one tabl menu select slightli differ usual tapa restaur visit around madrid food tasti servic quick friendli client le almost exclus consist us visitor whilst problem fellow english speak friend feel tourist hotspot rather authent madrileno favorit victim success ta perhap road casa luca situat call cava baja appear mani popular restaur fill local next time part town inclin visit one altern instead experi rather want better food,good review,4

Their response to this was to sarcastically utter the word “perfect.” There was a queue of people outside by this point so I’m sure they didn’t miss our custom but with attitudes like this I doubt the queues will continue for much longer.

We had read good reviews about the place and we decided to go for dinner on a Sunday night. We called ahead of time to make a reservation (it is required since it is a popular place). We all loved it. The atmosphere was nice (the basement is pretty, but if the weather is nice ask for a table in the ground floor. The don't make reservation for the 3-4 tables they have outside in the front, so go early for those. They are the best). The staff was very polite and friendly (everybody spoke English). We loved the food so much that we had dinner there 3 nights in a row (it was a four nights trip). We end up trying 4 or 5 pasta dishes which were all delicious (My wife loved the mussels and shrimp pasta dish). The house wine was also very good. The tiramisu and panna cotta were to die for. Our bill was between 60 and 80 euros, and that included wine and desert. Value for money. Overall, nice atmosphere, friendly staff, great food. We will definitely go back on our next visit.",2019-10-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1963635-Reviews-or10-Trattoria_Malatesta-Madrid.html,UID_23259,0.021,0.723,0.256,0.9961,0.43375,0.5269444444444444,0.3986200000000001,1059,91,0.0859301227573182,0,34,False,60,0.125,0.1607142857142857,0.2678571428571428,0.0714285714285714,0.1607142857142857,0.0535714285714285,0.0178571428571428,0.0357142857142857,0.0714285714285714,0.0357142857142857,201,134,4.27363184079602,0,0,visit trattoria malatesta last weekend septemb famili read good review place decid go dinner sunday night call ahead time make reserv requir sinc popular place love atmospher nice basement pretti weather nice ask tabl ground floor make reserv tabl outsid front go earli best staff polit friendli everybodi spoke english love food much dinner night row four night trip end tri pasta dish delici wife love mussel shrimp pasta dish hous wine also good tiramisu panna cotta die bill euro includ wine desert valu money overal nice atmospher friendli staff great food definit go back next visit,very good review,5

The menus for both are the same. Drinks were some of the cheapest we found in restaurants in the city (€2 for fizzy drinks and €1.80 for 50cl water) and there was a very large selection of pizza and pasta. They also kindly did me pasta with a plain tomato sauce, as i wanted something lighter and it was no problem for them at all. The waiters spoke excellent english (a rarety actually) and were friendly and extremely helpful. The portion sizes were wonderful for dinner, and excellent shared for lunch. There is plenty of seating inside and the outside seating is on a quiet but atmospheric side street. The first timne we went we sat outside, which was wonderful, however a 10% 'supplemento terraza' was added to the bill (which is large for a group of 9, basically adding the cost of another full meal on the bill). Also VAT (IVA at 8%) is not added on the menu, but added on the bill. This was no problem, but it did make dividing up what was owed difficult. Apart from these minor setbacks we did return (and ate inside, which was lovely and quiet and cool) and thoroughly enjoyed it once again.  It's funny to find such authentic and delicious italian food in a spanish city, but it really hit the spot with our group, and if we returned to madrid we would most definitely go back!",2011-07-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1963635-Reviews-or440-Trattoria_Malatesta-Madrid.html,UID_23288,0.011,0.81,0.178,0.993,0.2640756302521008,0.4961134453781513,0.4159090909090909,1334,122,0.0914542728635682,1,40,False,50,0.0357142857142857,0.1964285714285714,0.3035714285714285,0.0535714285714285,0.1785714285714285,0.0178571428571428,0.0,0.0535714285714285,0.0714285714285714,0.0892857142857142,248,163,4.379032258064516,0,0,us went dinner lunch menu drink cheapest found restaur citi fizzi drink cl water larg select pizza pasta also kindli pasta plain tomato sauc want someth lighter problem waiter spoke excel english rareti actual friendli extrem help portion size wonder dinner excel share lunch plenti seat insid outsid seat quiet atmospher side street first timn went sat outsid wonder howev supplemento terraza ad bill larg group basic ad cost anoth full meal bill also vat iva ad menu ad bill problem make divid owe difficult apart minor setback return ate insid love quiet cool thoroughli enjoy funni find authent delici italian food spanish citi realli hit spot group return madrid would definit go back,very good review,5

In a street that is end to end tapas you should definitely go here. There are small tapas such as the Madrid which is a gorgeous mix of morcilla with sweet onion relish on bread - one of their classics and very popular and only €6.  There is a relatively short Menu of tapas ranging from €15 to €25 but the portions are big and you would need to share the dishes unless you had a very, very healthy appetite - we are big eaters but we would still share! This time we ordered the squid wrapped in bacon with squid ink and it was fantastic. It comes well presented in parcels of battered squid wrapped in bacon but once the waiter has chopped and mixed it with the squid ink it looks lik a totally different dish and tastes fabulous.  On a previous visit in October we had eaten the classic Rabo del Toro and the pulpo (octopus on a mound of saffron potatoes ) and I had been looking forward to having the squid since then an I wasn't disappointed.

It has to be good because the other restaurants have more space, more waiters and better decore.  Menu: offers a lot of wines. Food menu is shorter in length but lists innovative tapas.  We ordered 4 tapas. The Alella (sp?) was so wonderful, we had to have more. Creamy potato on chicken with carmelized onion on toasted bread.  Because we didn't have reservations, we arrived at 8:05PM. Good thing because by 9:00 there were a lot of people waiting. The management eased their wait time by offering wine or beer to drink, standing up.  The space is small and tables simple. Service was efficient. Our waiter (one of 2?) took our order perfectly but was quite busy.

Understanding from the reviews that it is busy and a booking may be required, we headed towards this restaurant hoping we would be seated. As we arrived it was obvious it was busy. A man skipped us and asked for a table for 2 and the waiter said it will be a couple of minutes but you can wait across the way. I asked them for a table for two and he said “ah no that will be impossible, not until 11 o clock”. Unfortunate but we understood. We stepped to the side to find another restaurant online to eat in, to see another couple come up and ask for a table for two and again they were told it wouldn’t be too long and to step to the side with the other couple. I am not sure if this is because we look young or if they just pick customers who they think they will get most money out of. I understand Spanish so I was shocked to hear people come up and to be told no problem. Anyways we went and spent our hard earned money in a nearby Italian restaurant and we were happy to give it to them rather than this restaurant.

Although the menu is heavy on meat (my husband and I don't eat red meat or pork) we ordered a tapa with chicken, bonito and some sort of spinach/parsnip mousse. When the food came out it didn't look like anything special but once we tried it - we were very impressed. A delish, surprisingly complex taste sensation. Service was excellent and the waiter helped us pick out which wine to order based on our taste preferences - every wine we tried was great. The price is a bit high for what you get but these are no ordinary tapas. Also - make sure to get to the restaurant early - we got there a little after 8 and by the time we left at 9 it was packed.

The place itself is really small, do not expect any comfort: you seat on stools either directly at the bar counter or backed on a tiny board facing the wall. It gets claustrophobic with more than 10 patrons inside. I found the ambiance in the late evening quite bohemian, mostly young people enjoying rather loud pop and rock music. The food tasted great. The mini-hamburgers and squid croquettes were exquisite. The glass of house wine tasted pretty well. The service was extremely friendly and efficient.

Second, they aren't open all that much (lunch on the weekends, evenings only weekdays, and closed Monday), which is a good thing, because when they ARE, Marta is absolutely swamped with showing EVERYONE personal, super friendly, helpful attention. The chef is amazing (and fast!). I had that stunning caprese, and the langostines in tall puff-pastry ""caps"" (wound around them, each probably 10 inches long -- hard to describe, but amazing presentation -- in a tall glass -- and taste). Together it was a fantastic meal. The mozzarella in the caprese is called stracciatella, but is burrata -- the first time I've gotten to have that sensational experience. The heirloom tomatoes are chopped into chunks and are so dark-skinned they look like plums. The ball of cheese is in the middle, topped by fresh basil threads and a blob of pesto as well (or was that a truffled something or other?). The presentation was in a large bowl/plate with wide rim. What looked like black sesame seeds scattered around the rim was actually black salt. Very cool. Those tomatoes of course were just to die for -- after eating tons of jamon, and shrimp, and boquerones and Spanish tortilla.... fresh tomatoes were everything I was craving. They had a blackboard list of maybe 15 creative dishes, no ""typical"" tapas -- well, they did offer ""fish and chips"" (not a typical tapa anyway!), but I was assured it was not the normal dish. Had two glasses of a new red wine for me -- 100% Mencia grapes.

The portions are very small and the meals are expensive -- lunch was about 50 euros for a 3-course meal or 70/75 euros for a multi-course tasting menu, so it's not an every-day place, but it's certainly worth visiting now and then to see what's new in the food world and to have a special experience.

Last year we went there but the kitchen was closing for the afternoon so we just had drinks. Fortunately, our attempt this year was on a Thursday when they are open till 17:00.  La Berenjena is not far from the Reina Sofia or Plaza Mayor. It is on a side street off Calle de Atocha. If you were just walking by you would probably never stop. It is very small and very unpretentious! BUT, once you experience the hospitality of the staff, taste the quality of their food, behold their creative presentations, and enter into discussions with the locals whose favorite it is you will return here year after year. In fact, it is a ""destination place""! Constant Companion and I had not reserved a table(there is one or two in the back) so we sat at the bar and perused the chalkboards. One was dedicated to drinks, the other to food. I suspected we were in for a treat when we were brought a tapas of Potatoes and Padron Peppers-one of my favorites! We knew before we arrived that we were going to split a Caprese Salad with Stracciatella(14 Euros)since it is one of the dishes for which they are famous. It was absolutely fabulous! CC opted for Berenjenas con Salsa de Miso (8,5 Euros). You have to look at our picture of this entree. She often cooks with Miso and adored this dish! I decided to select the Navajas de la Ria con Crema de Coco, Lima y Cilantro (15,5 Euros). OMG, razor clams with cream of coconut, lime and chilantro-just heavenly!! CC ordered two Mi Mama Me Mima Albarino @ 3,5 Euros apiece, which were a very nice accompaniment. I went with two Vina Pomal Crianza @ 3,0 Euros each. Later, we got talking with the bar tender, a couple of local guys, and a lovely young Spanish couple so we ended up there over 3 hours.

Its very innovative, reasonable cost and the food is great. Its located close to Atocha/Reina Sophia on a side street and is basically a bar and looks nothing like a restaurant from the street or even looking in. It has a table for 2 and a table for 4 in the very back next to the kitchen so unless you reserve a table ahead of time you can order the food standing or on a stool in the bar area. But we noticed the Bar area can get very busy also. The Caprese salad is very good and have ordered it a few times. The baby crab is also great, kinda like eating softshell crab. The Eggplant was perfectly cooked but had a little too much miso sauce.  We have tried 2 of the skirt steak dishes and while the flavor was great they were both a little tough, but most beef in Spain is. Service is great.

The place itself is very small and they only have a couple of proper tables but you can sit on stools. We had a total of 4 glasses of wine - which was exceptional - a shared caprese salad, one main each and a dessert and the bill came to 60€ total. It's not cheap but you would pay much more on a more formal/famous restaurant for the same food. We really liked the food, it's not Spanish traditional but more like fusion, nice mix of flavours and top quality products. Service was friendly but very knowledgeable and helpful. Overall we really liked it and it was a treat, a nice way to try something new. It's definitely recommended, I think it's good also for dinner but try to book a place early.

Rilette was wonderful, and a dish of chopped, flash cooked, salt sprinkled, smoky (subtlety anchovy infused?) fillet steak fleshed out a solid meal for two. Great wine recommendation, fabulous playlist (including Midnight Oil for a bit of Oz feel-right-at-homeness), local buzz even at that hour, all added up to a memorable meal.",2016-04-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4795130-Reviews-or70-La_Berenjena-Madrid.html,UID_23382,0.056,0.781,0.163,0.9657,0.2414351851851851,0.5638888888888888,0.372,863,55,0.063731170336037,0,36,False,33,0.1153846153846153,0.1153846153846153,0.3461538461538461,0.1153846153846153,0.1153846153846153,0.0384615384615384,0.0,0.0769230769230769,0.0384615384615384,0.0384615384615384,145,120,4.958620689655173,0,0,expect eat tonight life happen quick look trip advisor eateri neighbourhood revel la berenjena arriv almost sunday night reserv two tabl book ate narrow littl wall shelf opposit bar bar waitstaff fantast broken english sign languag menu vagu understood order place top menu famou hous salad famou good reason explan tri rilett wonder dish chop flash cook salt sprinkl smoki subtleti anchovi infus fillet steak flesh solid meal two great wine recommend fabul playlist includ midnight oil bit oz feel right home local buzz even hour ad memor meal,good review,4

On my own in Madrid for a day, I decided that eating out as a single woman was not going to deter me from visiting the restaurants I wanted to try. So I stopped in on the way back to my guest house from the Reina Sofia (which is close by), and I'm so glad I did. It was the best meal I had in Madrid! My Spanish is basic, and there was a young woman there---still not sure if she was an employee or friend---who wanted to practice her English. So she asked me what I liked, and suggested several dishes. I prefer not to eat meat, so we picked seafood and vegetarian entrees. The first course was that wonderful caprese salad that seems to be very popular---and for good reason. The many pictures here show how delicious it looks and tastes. What dark, flavorful tomatoes, creamy cheese! The black salt scattered around the plate is a nice touch. I savored every bite! I wasn't sure what my next course would turn out to be, since the young lady wasn't sure what it was in English. But it was the razor clams in a lovely broth. There were 6 of them, and I savored each one as well. I had a tinto de verano to drink, and sat at the bar. It was almost empty when I came in, but as it got later, the small room got very crowded, and everyone was busy. I'm glad I was able to talk to them before the crowds came, otherwise, I know I would have felt rushed, and they wouldn't have been able to give me as much attention. I was at ease sitting at the bar---though the backless wooden stools are not conducive to really relaxing---and enjoyed people watching. There seemed to be more locals of all ages than tourists. In the background was a killer soundtrack of American music, everything from Prince to vintage Elvis. I just took a deep breath, looked around, and realized that I was having a great time. The meal was not cheap---about 26 euros---and could have been a lot more if I had had dessert or tried some other dishes. But I felt it was worth the price for such delicious, innovative food (I saw other interesting looking dishes coming out of the kitchen), and appealing atmosphere.

We booked a table in advance and when we came we were a bit surprised because of the place and how everything looked like. We thought we are for sure in a wrong place but then the super friendly girl (waitress) explained us that our table waits us is a bit further but when we´ve seen it we were more schocked :) to be honest we wanted to leave but the waitress was really very friendly and positive, so we decided to stay for a drink and apetizer. After she brought us tomato with cheese (you find quite a lot photos on tripadvisor) we understood how wrong we were because it was amazing and really tasty! The presentation of the food was really good. We were ashamed as we were convinced they dont serve a good food. Then we changed our mind and also ordered aubergine and fish.

As with most restaurants in Spain this place is small so they use the sidewalk for additional space. Our server’s name was Luigi and he was amazing, using as much English as possible to help us through picking some specialties. We chose a bottle of Chianti and the dinner for 2. We started with the baked provolone and it did not disappoint, that pan left the table scraped clean. My wife had the tagliatelle bolognese, she loved the flavor and al dente pasta, I tried a bite and it was super yummy. I had the pizza favorita which was a veggie option with mushrooms and eggplant. I think it’s in the top 5 pizzas I have ever eaten, super thin and crispy crust. We had the strawberry creme dessert to top off our night.

We were so happy we did! I think we got the last open table at 9 PM. It was cozy on a very cold night in Madrid. My partner had picked two things from the menu, a roast beef appetizer and a main course (oxtail) and both dishes were sold out. I was worried she wouldn't enjoy herself because she was so disappointed. So she went with second choices, a vegetable strata, and lasagne. I had a seafood ravioli. They were all exquisite, beautifully blended flavors and delicately made. And a wonderful light cheesecake for dessert.

We ordered 4 varieties of pasta - tagliatelle funghi misti, taliolini pesto, pappardelle (or tagliatelle?) with mussels/clams, and another vegetarian style pasta. Everything was fresh, light, made in-house, and absolutely excellent. The complex flavor of the sauces in combination with the handmade pasta rival anything I've had in Italy - and probably one of my favorite Italian places of all time (all countries considered).  Tiramisu was great as well - though not the best I've had in my travels.  The service was very friendly and we felt very welcomed here - unlike many other Spanish establishments we went to during our trip. We barely spoke any Spanish/italian but the server did his best in answering our questions in English - he even took out and showed us plates of different pasta noodles when we had a question about the menu.

The place itself is in a very quaint pedestrianised street in a busy part of the city. The restaurant has a terrace, an upstairs and a downstairs - careful when wearing high heels and needing to go downstairs either to the bathroom or if you are seated there, the stairs are lethal! I had booked a table for three and originally were given a table downstairs but the waiters were able to accommodate us as it was such a lovely evening and gave us a table on the terrace. The menu is ample so there is a very wide choice of food. Starters/salads cost approximately 8-11 euros. We shared the provoletta (grilled cheese) and a mini lasagne style dish made up of layers of aubergine, both of which were divine. For your main course, there are pastas, pizzas, risottos, meat... enough for everyone. I'm a vegetarian and normally have a problem finding things on the menu but i was spoilt for choice. I chose the ravioli stuffed with spinach & cheese accompanied with a wild mushroom sauce, a friend had a spicy pizza and another had the wild mushroom risotto. Each main course ranged from 10 - 15 euros, and they were all individually delicious. the desserts cost about 5 euros. We had the canoli with berry sauce (heaven) and a kind of crumble with cream, and to drink 2 bottles of the rosé Lambrussco (very easy on the palate!). The whole meal cost 33 euros each. There was an offer for 2 people to share a starter plus two main courses at 18 euros, not including the drink. The food might seem a little pricey but it really is delicious and the ambience is wonderful if you are sat outside on the terrace. The waiters were friendly but took quite a long time coming to take our order and giving us our bill at the end. Having said that, all in all it was a very good experience.",2012-10-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1963635-Reviews-or430-Trattoria_Malatesta-Madrid.html,UID_23420,0.009,0.838,0.153,0.9959,0.2257222222222222,0.5830000000000001,0.454970588235294,1867,164,0.0878414568826995,2,47,False,68,0.1095890410958904,0.1780821917808219,0.3013698630136986,0.0821917808219178,0.136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.0273972602739726,0.0273972602739726,0.0684931506849315,0.0547945205479452,344,213,4.430232558139535,0,0,book read review trip advisor disappoint place quaint pedestrianis street busi part citi restaur terrac upstair downstair care wear high heel need go downstair either bathroom seat stair lethal book tabl three origin given tabl downstair waiter abl accommod us love even gave us tabl terrac menu ampl wide choic food starter salad cost approxim euro share provoletta grill chees mini lasagn style dish made layer aubergin divin main cours pasta pizza risotto meat enough everyon vegetarian normal problem find thing menu spoilt choic chose ravioli stuf spinach chees accompani wild mushroom sauc friend spici pizza anoth wild mushroom risotto main cours rang euro individu delici dessert cost euro canoli berri sauc heaven kind crumbl cream drink bottl ro lambrussco easi palat whole meal cost euro offer peopl share starter plu two main cours euro includ drink food might seem littl pricey realli delici ambienc wonder sat outsid terrac waiter friendli took quit long time come take order give us bill end said good experi,very good review,5

The place was very busy so we were placed at the end of the bar by the kitchen entrance.  Throughout our whole meal, the waiters kept passing by and pushing us to get passed which made it very difficult to eat and have a conversation. We didn't co plain about this as we understood the place was busy. However, when we asked for the bill we noticed there were several mistakes. First of all, we were charged for three drinks although we had only had too. Secondly, we'd ordered a half portion but were charged a full portion. And after having the bill corrected twice, there was still a mistake: the half portion was billed 3 euros more than it should have been. By then, we were tired of having to asked them to correct the bill again so we just paid and left. I'm pretty sure this wasn't a mistake and was voluntary but the waitress just kept on smiling and apologizing for the mistakes.

As I said, we enjoyed it so much, we ended up coming back for our last night in Madrid. First time, we were there a little early (jet lagged from our flight to Spain) and we were able to get a table. Second time, the place was packed, however we were able to get stools at the bar.

Cod which was really good and I was tempted by the yellow fin tuna dish on the menu so I will just have to visit again.

And the food just happens to be terrific. We arrived around 9pm and the place was already packed but with no others waiting. This place was small like most of the other places on this street. We were attended to quickly but were kindly told that a table would take about 40 minutes so we pulled up a tiny corner and the people next to us graciously relented a little wiggle room so that my wife and our 16month old (yes we're adventurous :) could get a little more comfy. The server, while playfully greeting our daughter, offered to make even more room for us by tucking our stroller away in a storage closet. This tone of helpful, attentive, and friendly service carried on throughout our experience here with all of the staff. The English menu we were given helped a little but wasn't really needed as Maria on their staff did speak English well. She helped my wife pick a nice fruity glass of white wine and we ordered the calamari and the risotto with foie gras. The calamari came out looking like perfect golden breaded strips wrapped in crisp ham. On the same plate were a kind of squid ink mousse. The staff cut up the calamari and ham into smaller portions and mixed the squid ink in with it in front of us. The result was a heavenly mix of the most lightly textured, not at all rubbery, calamari we've ever had along with a crispy outside and the rich flavor of squid ink bringing it all together. This was a large portion and if we were truly hungry my wife and I could have easily finished it because it was that good. The risotto came out in good pace as a foie gras patty and a fried egg floating in a bed of rice. This too was cut up and mixed together for us. I am a foie gras fan but the flavor of this dish is very strong. It is a good strong, but was an unexpected one. Overall the dish was still very delicious and as it also came out in a large serving which we could not finish it either. So note that you may easily over order here. Having a toddler we couldn't eat too fast but we never felt rushed. The bill was very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food, two drinks, and service. On our way out the staff helped carry out to the sidewalk and waved good night to us. This place definitely deserves its awards. We are planning on coming back to try out other dishes. I would recommend this to anyone especially families.",2012-09-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1822624-Reviews-or400-Casa_Lucas-Madrid.html,UID_23481,0.014,0.77,0.216,0.999,0.2591708437761068,0.5371136173767753,0.428112,2532,238,0.093996840442338,0,44,False,100,0.1566265060240964,0.1927710843373494,0.2891566265060241,0.0843373493975903,0.2048192771084337,0.0,0.0,0.0120481927710843,0.0481927710843373,0.0120481927710843,481,264,4.266112266112266,0,0,eaten three day madrid far first place eaten provid truli welcom experi servic smile food happen terrif arriv around pm place alreadi pack other wait place small like place street attend quickli kindli told tabl would take minut pull tini corner peopl next us gracious relent littl wiggl room wife month old ye adventur could get littl comfi server play greet daughter offer make even room us tuck stroller away storag closet tone help attent friendli servic carri throughout experi staff english menu given help littl realli need maria staff speak english well help wife pick nice fruiti glass white wine order calamari risotto foie gra calamari came look like perfect golden bread strip wrap crisp ham plate kind squid ink mouss staff cut calamari ham smaller portion mix squid ink front us result heavenli mix lightli textur rubberi calamari ever along crispi outsid rich flavor squid ink bring togeth larg portion truli hungri wife could easili finish good risotto came good pace foie gra patti fri egg float bed rice cut mix togeth us foie gra fan flavor dish strong good strong unexpect one overal dish still delici also came larg serv could finish either note may easili order toddler eat fast never felt rush bill reason qualiti quantiti food two drink servic way staff help carri sidewalk wave good night us place definit deserv award plan come back tri dish would recommend anyon especi famili,very good review,5

Reasonable prices and truly excellent food. The key here is getting in. They restaurant seats probably not more than 20 people. We went on a whim and got a spot. Several groups were turned away—there was just no room. If you know your schedule, try to book ahead. Otherwise, it’s a neighborhood with many restaurants, so you can try your luck and go somewhere else if you can’t get a seat.  Portions are very large.

I ate there twice, once in the small restaurant at the back of the building and the second time in the bar area (with post-prandials taken outside).  The Bahia Taberna is a small place located in a residential area. From the outside it looks just like countless other places throughout span (and the world). But step inside, and things change. In the back, there are a few tables (maybe a dozen or so covers) along with the Pass into the kitchen. You get a nice view of the workings sitting here. The front is more of a bar with tall chair. And of course, being Spain, you can eat and drink outside. The menus is mainly Mediterranean and the service sort of tapas style, reminisicnt of the tasting menus I’ve had at other places. On the first night we had several dishes (five courses I think) - the octopus was especially good and the chicken sublime. But the cheesecake for dessert was to die for! We had seconds of that on my first visit and I insisted we have it on our second. A good choice both times.  Drinks were good - the first time we had a nice abraninio and a Ribera del Duero while the second visit I drank wine from the glass (the ‘house’ RBD) as the others were on beer or coke. Their signature drink here seems to be Gin And Tonic. Nothing very special, I hear you say - yeah, right! Possibly the best G&Ts I’ve had in decades. Worth visiting for the drink alone! While the food and drink was fantastic, the service was even better. The manager and staff were all very passionate about their food and their place and went out of their way to make us feel happy and welcome. They were very informal (tshirts/short trousers), relaxed but very good at delivering an outstanding experience. It’s no wonder why this place is ranked #3 in Madrid! All things combined, both visits were outstanding - albeit different in ambience (the more formal restaurant vs the bar). This is the sort of place that would get me to go back again and again.

They were prepared at the table too, very nice. We were introduced to Miguel who spoke excellent English who was to become our waiter. When our table was ready he brought our drinks and seated us. Very small restaurant but they have seating in the bar, not as cosy but it would work. Miguel showed us the small menu and asked if we would like him to choose for us. He also asked if we have any allergies to any food! Nice touch. We then proceeded to be treated to probably one of the most pleasant dining experiences we've ever had. 4 courses, each served on different types of plates, and fresh silverware with each course. Miguel checked with us often, even one of the owners/managers checked to see if everything was good. And the food, the flavors, presentation, every course was fantastic!

My sister had an amazing pizza, you just can't go wrong in that restaurant. It was truely an authentic italian experience, and a very unexpected find.

We ate the third and last ""Hot tapas"" dish on the menu consisting of pan-fried chicken breast on a bed of caramelised red onion shavings served on a piece of fresh white loaf. The whole tapa was topped with a yellow pure (do not know the ingredients), however, it reminded me of a root vegetable pure with sweet tones. The second course out was a tomato, basil and goat cheese salad generously sprinkled with a tasty and sharp-coloured olive oil (could have added a few sea salt flakes to send me ""off the top""). Thirdly, we were served a black good portioned caneloni filled vegetables (carrots) and gambas placed in a thick (and delicious) sauce of cream, seafood stock and poppy seeds (WOW!). The only big, big minus was that the place is small and too popular for its own good.. Meaning the tables in which initially are meant for four are filled-up with five-six-seven making the path line to kitchen/bar for the waiting staff a walking nightmare (and the guests are bumped in the back a few times..). The restaurant does not have desserts. Do not know if it is because they simple do what they can best (the excellent food) or, again; want people to leave once they have eaten to increase the table turnover. Regardless of this; the waiting staff are friendly, experienced and quick. I would recommend the place for a (small) group of friends (not couple) who wants a dinner before hitting the city OR come between 19-21.00 and you will be enjoying the dinner for a longer period.

I talked to the manager and he said the size is normal. ""In Italy is that so"", he said. Anyway, I told him I did not like and said he should show the size of the pizza for the next customers. At the and of the dinner, one entire pizza left!!! We took away the pizza and gave to a couple of homeless in the center of Madri: that was the best part of our dinner!

Keep at it until you find someone in the place who can tell you how long for a table, and unless you're desparately hungry, wait it out. Most of the crowds are not there to sit down and eat, they are there to stand, have a quick tapa and a glass of wine or a beer, and socialize with friends. It may not be as long as you think for a table. As far as Casa Lucas, we tried 5 places in the Latin district, 4 of them on Calle Cava Baja. Of them all, Casa Lucas was our favorite. We had a risotto, a potato dish and the most amazing shredded meat dish that I could have had for 5 nights straight. Absolutely amazing food, we talked about that meat dish the entire way back to our hotel. I recommend you do what we did, which is ask the staff for their recommendations. They abosultely nailed it.

Thus there was so much on the menu that i'd like to have tried but couldnt because of portion sizes and cost. Anyway the food; i opted for the pork loin on a bed of caramelised onions. Absolutely succulent meat and sweet onions all on top of some warm french bread. Lovely. There were only two dishes from the mains they could do as smaller dishes and i opted for the Calamari. When it came out it looked amazing but before i had a chance to tuck in the waiter had cut everything up for me and mixed it around. Taste wise it was still sublime but i'd quite liked to have done all this myself. Anyway i can see why this place does so well on trip advisor. The reviews are well deserved.

I think it is fair to say the place went above and beyond our expectations, and we would happily take a trip back to Madrid just to dine at casa lucas again.  Selma was an incredible host, making sure we got a comfortable table and guiding us expertly on ordering the right proportion of dishes and styles (which is refreshing from the plethora of tourist traps trying to push and upsell orders). The portions were generous and filling and we would have ordered way too much food if not for her advice (not to mention 4 fantastic glasses of wine which she catered to our palate). We ordered two pintxos - the pork loin on apple sauce and blood sausage with scrambled eggs. Both we absolutely delicious. The mains were 1/2 portion each of fried squid with squid ink mousse (which was expertly cut and served by Selma) and the black pasta stuffed with sea food - very different flavours and textures, but fabulous in their own way. In conclusion, amazing food, ambience and service, was truly mind-blowing and a great change from the tourist trap of Mercado de San Miguel which we visited earlier in the day.

We rate this restaurant highly and regard it as our favourite in Madrid.  The dining room is elegant and stylish but yet comfortable and relaxing. We find the level of service to be consistently outstanding. The menu is more than sufficiently varied for us and there are always a number of ""specials of the day"". The chef seems to focus on using, as far as is possible, fresh local produce, to prepare it perfectly and present it professionally. The wine list is fairly extensive and has wine to suit most tastes and pockets. La Paloma is a fine dining restaurant and, therefore, not cheap but for us it offers value for money - for a three course meal with wine our typical spend is €55 to €75 per head. A nice touch is that half portions of many of the dishes can be ordered.

However, in Madrid my meal at Terraza Casino/Paco Roncero was significantly better than DiverXO. The food was more memorable and the service was perfect. Easily two michelin star quality and fun. (Unfortunately the bill at DiverXO was almost twice that of Terraa Casino because the food and wine was higher priced.)

They are very efficient in replying emails, good english with a clear-cut answer. I tried to smaller version of the menu (145€). Before you get seated, the first appetizer will be served with a drink at the bar in front of the restaurant.  The fried calamari was spectacular, taking into account that it was fried without any batter. Then they will proceed to the kitchen. The theme menu as of jan 2020 was about sustainability. How they tried to use all parts of seafood in their restaurants. It was fun. I myself was explained about the process by Diego, the chef owner. He was very friendly, knowledgeable and approachable. It was quite an experience.  Then they served the rest of the dishes on the table.  I was impressed by almost every dishes, especially the dessert with strawberry which is appropriately named in spanish beber con la boca llena.  My next table was a couple with a 5-6 year old kid who was very well behaved and a food enthusiast. The restaurant also managed very professionally with the kids.

It was an amazing dining experience.  Location is wonderful- very formal. Very stylish. Very elegant. Located in a wonderful building which does not disappoint inside- beautiful chandeliers and frescos on the ceiling. Ornate plaster mouldings. It is beautiful and raises expectations for the menu for sure. Imagine then how I felt when I was presented with the Degustation menu to find that the first course was a pizza carbonara ?!!!! My heart sank !!! But you just have to go for it !!! Any concerns that I had evaporated on the first mouthful ! The chef is playful with his menu- international too- includes pizza, taco, curry and a thai dish. It some ways it seems like an experimental menu but none of the experiments went wrong ! It is a menu that gives the chefs the opportunity to show off their talents for sure. The food was beautiful in terms of the variery of dishes, the flavours and the presentation. In total there are 25 courses ( i think) and wine pairing is available- fortunately it doesnt include 25 wines otherwise you would be under the table for the second half of the meal ! Each dish is , of course, very small, and a taster but the overall impact of the meal is so very memorable. I have dined at many fine restaurants in Madrid but this is the most memorable dining experience.  Of course it is top end pricing which only reflects the qulaity of the establishment and the chefs team- also the very professional staff in front of house - the Degustation menu is €185 and wine pairings €110 but this does include IVA !! At the time of writing I do not know if this place is Michelin starred ? - it must be? Possibly a 2☆- if not Michelin are missing a trick. This place has the WOW factor ! Was there a downside ? The only downside I can think of is that we did not get a menu for the wine pairings- in some ways , my fault, I should have asked, but was too absorbed with the food menu, but it would have been better to have known what we were drinking. All of the wines were totally complimentary to the meal and for once, they were definately secondary to the food itself.

Stopped in upstairs for a vermouth, then decided to venture downstairs and stay for dinner. First, the vermouth. House made and delicious. It begins with a martini glass, two ice cubes and a spritz from an atomizer. Then the vermouth is poured over the ice. Just a bit of Campari is drizzled on top, then garnished with a lemon twist and olive. Perfection! When I told my server I was celiaca, she took my menu and replaced it with a special menu for gluten free. A tapas bite of mozzarella on a GF cracker was presented with my drink.

My boyfriend at the time ordered the curry chicken and I tried the sauce because he said it was the most amazing thing he had ever tasted. Then, I just said ""screw it"" and ate a piece of the chicken. This was the first time that I had eaten meat in 7 years.  Recently, I moved to Madrid and knew that I had to visit this tapas bar to see if it was as good as I remembered. It was. Taberna la Concha has quickly become my favorite place in all of Madrid. It is centrally located in La Latina (near Plaza Mayor) and the chef is the nicest person ever. He speaks perfect English which is a plus for me because I still struggle greatly with the Spanish language. Also, the last time I visited this bar the chef gave us a free dessert and a free glass of rojo cava (a sort of sparkling wine native to Spain).

We were the first ones in but that didn't last long. Ordered the pimientos de padron, croquetas de jamon iberica, mixed paella and pumpkin ravioli. For drinks we had cerveza (can't recall the brand) and a sangria, plus 2 bottlesof water. Finally for dessert my husband ordered a passionfruit cake ( which turned out to be cheesecake). The waiter brought out a complimentary bowl of green olives. The pimientos de padron had a nice char on them with a sprinkling of sea salt. The croquetas were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside as they should be. The portion sizes are generous. In fact, we didn't finish the pimientos de padron even though we tried and ate them after our mains came. My husband devoured his pumpkin ravioli. My mixed paella was very aromatic and delicious. It had some squid, mussels, pork rib, chicken, and a large whole prawn. The rice was very flavorful. The portion size is enough for 2 people if you're sharing other dishes or generous for one person. I found the cheesecake to be too sweet for me but my husband loved it. Then again I'm not a sweets person. The presentation of the food was spot on as we ate with our eyes first when they were brought to our table. Service was excellent. Would come back and recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal at reasonable prices. Our meal with drinks came to 50.90 euros.",2019-07-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10682513-Reviews-or40-H10_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_23695,0.011,0.834,0.155,0.9934,0.2034340659340659,0.4898809523809524,0.34159,1480,129,0.0871621621621621,0,39,False,54,0.0952380952380952,0.238095238095238,0.3095238095238095,0.0476190476190476,0.238095238095238,0.0,0.0,0.0238095238095238,0.0476190476190476,0.0,266,172,4.567669172932331,0,0,chanc upon restaur walk around sunday even search place dinner first one last long order pimiento de padron croqueta de jamon iberica mix paella pumpkin ravioli drink cerveza recal brand sangria plu bottlesof water final dessert husband order passionfruit cake turn cheesecak waiter brought complimentari bowl green oliv pimiento de padron nice char sprinkl sea salt croqueta crispi outsid soft insid portion size gener fact finish pimiento de padron even though tri ate main came husband devour pumpkin ravioli mix paella aromat delici squid mussel pork rib chicken larg whole prawn rice flavor portion size enough peopl share dish gener one person found cheesecak sweet husband love sweet person present food spot ate eye first brought tabl servic excel would come back recommend restaur anyon look good meal reason price meal drink came euro,very good review,5

We sat at the one outdoor table available and enjoyed watching all the neighborhood activity. We started with a nice bottle of their most expensive white wine (18 euro!). Enjoyed our spot so much we had a second bottle of 12 euro wine.  We started with a bowl of grilled peppers. For 5 euro they were a bargain- we could not eat them all. Very tasty! I ordered a salad with burrata cheese. There was plenty of cheese and the rocket and tomatoes were nice, but the salad needed some balsamic vinegar. I ordered the shelled seafood paella. It was very tasty but a tad dry. I think it lacked some spice. It had nice mussels calamari rings and shrimp. For 12.50 euro it was worth the money  Hubby had the grilled octopus.

The ambience is warm and bright without being pretentious. There were few people there at 9:00 on a Saturday night, the time of our reservation, but the place was packed by 11:00. Except for one other table and ours, all of the patrons were locals and it was obvious that this was both a dining and social experience for them. Most of the men had blazers or sports coats and the women wore dressers. No poorly dressed tourists with their I-phones being used!!! Wonderful.  A great menu with many choices for appetizers, first courses and entrees. We very much enjoyed the oxtails in a rich and tasty sauce and the venison steak with sauce and local fruit compotes. The manager attended to each table, was very friendly and his wine selections were perfectly paired. He and the staff were not proficient at English, but they have English menus and all went well with their limited English and our limited Spanish. The cost with wine was about 65 euros each and we considered it very reasonable.",2015-10-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2317039-Reviews-or30-La_Paloma-Madrid.html,UID_23721,0.031,0.793,0.175,0.9895,0.2795928996598639,0.438954081632653,0.3498363636363636,1150,106,0.0921739130434782,3,26,False,41,0.1111111111111111,0.0555555555555555,0.2777777777777778,0.0,0.1666666666666666,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.1666666666666666,0.1111111111111111,204,140,4.637254901960785,0,0,wife perhap enjoy dinner two week spain thank hotel manag hotel orfila told us restaur ambienc warm bright without pretenti peopl saturday night time reserv place pack except one tabl patron local obviou dine social experi men blazer sport coat women wore dresser poorli dress tourist phone use wonder great menu mani choic appet first cours entre much enjoy oxtail rich tasti sauc venison steak sauc local fruit compot manag attend tabl friendli wine select perfectli pair staff profici english english menu went well limit english limit spanish cost wine euro consid reason,very good review,5

It sits in a charming neighborhood just a short taxi ride from our hotel near the Prado museum. The food was excellent and varied. Our group, which included teenagers and adults (including two vegetarians) all found many delightful options. The red tuna tartare, crispy spring rolls, and suckling pig were my favorites. All of the options come in full and half portions (more than half, actually), which enabled our group to experiment.  Putting aside the delicious food, the best part about La Paloma is the attentive and friendly service. The servers take a formal, old-school approach to dining service, but it never felt stuffy. Our Spanish was ""un poco,"" at best, and the staff really seemed to enjoy the fact that we were there. At the end of the evening, the owner/manager (?) came by and gave us free tastings of various highly-potent Spanish after-dinner liquors (similar to Italian grappa).  La Paloma is a more formal restaurant than many of the Spanish tapas restaurants, but the excellent food, terrific wine list and top-notch service make this a great choice - even among all the terrific options Madrid has to offer.",2015-07-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2317039-Reviews-or30-La_Paloma-Madrid.html,UID_5102,0.0,0.789,0.211,0.9946,0.3654761904761905,0.4971428571428571,0.4678818181818183,1235,86,0.0696356275303643,0,42,False,54,0.0980392156862745,0.196078431372549,0.3529411764705882,0.0392156862745098,0.2156862745098039,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0392156862745098,0.0392156862745098,210,151,4.876190476190477,0,0,last night madrid trip primarili andalusia friend dinner la paloma sit charm neighborhood short taxi ride hotel near prado museum food excel vari group includ teenag adult includ two vegetarian found mani delight option red tuna tartar crispi spring roll suckl pig favorit option come full half portion half actual enabl group experi put asid delici food best part la paloma attent friendli servic server take formal old school approach dine servic never felt stuffi spanish un poco best staff realli seem enjoy fact end even owner manag came gave us free tast variou highli potent spanish dinner liquor similar italian grappa la paloma formal restaur mani spanish tapa restaur excel food terrif wine list top notch servic make great choic even among terrif option madrid offer,good review,4

The food was superb and was matched by the setting. I had Iberian ham followed by Tuna. Both were superb and plentiful. My wife had the steak and this was cooked exactly as requested. The house red was a very nice Rioja. You can find cheaper restaurants in Madrid all serving up the same tourist menu, but even if it is just for one evening try La Paloma. I have paid far more than this in London and come away disappointed. You will not be disappointed at La Paloma. No gimmicks, just excellent food and service in a very nice setting. If you can speak a little Spanish it will probably enhance your visit but I don't think it is essential. I recommend you try this proper Spanish restaurant. Next time I am in Madrid I will return.

It’s not a fancy place by far but the food is out of this world: authentic, flavourful, creative, plentiful! The tapas are not the usual fare that you find in most local restaurants. They’re unique and more tasteful than what you might be accustomed to. All the menu items are available without gluten if you choose to. Kudos to the Chef for the thought. The local wines are excellent. The lady who assumes the service by herself is extremely cordial, fast and efficient. The prices are very reasonable.

Picasso's dove alights on the napkins & reproduction paintings line the walls. Everything gleams with elegance including the excellent staff. Carpaccio of foie gras was paper thin slices of delicious foie gras drizzled with olive oil, flecked w/sea salt - to die for! The lobster bisque was the real thing & oysters fresh & delisious! You can order 1/2 plates of the main courses so we shared monkfish (rape), cod (bacalo), sweet breads (mollejas de ternera) & their famous crispy roast pig (conchillo). Chocolate souffle & apple tart for dessert.
