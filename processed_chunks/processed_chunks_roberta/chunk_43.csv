Walk in and be greeted by a host of Spanish cheeses and meats (Iberico, Chorizo, pate, etc.) available by the kilo with accompanying wines, fruits, nuts, and other items for your next dinner party or for the roving gourmand. A handful of tables in the front make it a delicatessen where you can get a coffee, pastry, empanada, etc. Deli area quickly fills with an eclectic blend of neighborhood characters (the struggling writer, the morning newspaper-reader, the older Spanish gentleman holding court in the back, etc.).  Friends who are serious about cheese tell me that their selection is simply excellent and among the best in Madrid. I tried of couple of the pasteurized Spanish goat cheeses and they were outstanding. Walk towards the back and find a full wine/coffee bar and dinning area comfortably seating perhaps 20 or so people, simply but charmingly decorated. Any of the deli items are available as well as a series of hot dishes and salads as well as tapas staples like tostas with anchovies. I sat in the back and ordered a spicy chorizo, some goat cheese, a glass of red wine, and had my lunch. Far too much meat for me to eat though, should have only ordered the half portion. Meal was under 20 Euros including wine and a generous helping of Chorizo de Leon (would have paid $20 alone in the States for a portion of that size).  Staff are friendly and remember you but can get slammed when both the front and back of house are full so those wishing a quick meal stay in the front as the back slows down during peak times. The Calle Atocha area is a poor area for restaurants but this is absolutely the exception and if you love wine and cheese (or good Iberico) stop by. Credit Cards are accepted.

Set in La Latina, Vacas is very homely , looks like you would expect an old Spanish restaurant to be but serving some great Madrileño dishes. Ordered some vermut to start which came with a plate of deliciously juicy , tasty black olives and a bread basket. Started with a plate of wonderfully crunchy croquetas containing a creamy light ham filling complimented with a simple tomato salad, just perfect! Mains were slightly bigger than expected but packed a punch, my morcillo estofado ( stewed beef shin) was served with in a rich onion sauce and came off the bone easily, beautiful tender meat, quails stuffed with paté and mushrooms was awesome, served with crispy little fries but just too much and if bones aren’t your thing best to avoid . Other diners’ meals all looked great too. Wine selection was good and pretty reasonable, no room for a desert but a free shot of digestif was appreciated from the host, total including the water and wine came to €70 which was decent value considering the quality of the food and cooking. Staff were very friendly and hospitable and English menus are available if your Spanish is not up to scratch. Very good choice for excellent home style cooking and enjoyable meal if in the area .

They were quite busy but we managed to get a table outside without waiting. We had to wait a little while to order and then to get our bill at the end, but the food arrived quickly! I asked about gluten-free options, and as well as being knowledgeable about what they have (including gluten-free buns), the waiter also brought me the allergen menu to check. This made it easier when ordering, as I knew which sauces etc. I could eat. I went for a BBQ burger, which was mainly gluten-free (only 1 mayo that wasn't, so asked for it without) as long as served with a gluten-free bun. The chips are also suitable for coeliacs - and super yummy! The whole meal was just right, full of flavour with the burger cooked exactly how I'd asked it to be.

And oh boy, I am so happy we came across Burnout. The decoration is American 70s, it's like going back in time with a good touch. They even have books dating back to the 50s in Spain. They offer salads and different types of burgers. I went for the Burnout Smokin burger and I would totally recommend it, it was well done as I ordered and had an amazing flavour. The bun was sweet and unique and the mixture of ingredients and sauces made this a stunning burger. Your burger comes with a side of fries, which differ from those you find at fast food restaurants, this ones had a more natural feeling. As a treat for dessert we ordered a couple of Guiness cakes, which are apparently a thing in Madrid but I had never seen in London before. I loved the flavour and the moist texture!

We happened by this place today and I´m glad we gave it a try. This is a great burger, a fun place to eat and its in a wonderful location. Calle Fuencarral is a great street for shopping and watching people. The fact that this restaurant has nice outdoor seating makes it even nicer. But the food is the best part. I was very surprised at the quality of my cheeseburger and the fries. My wife tried the chicken tenders and they were okay, but not something I would order again. We tried the nachos as an appetizer and they were very good. All in all a nice eating experience and worth a return visit. Service was friendly and prompt and the outdoor seating is very comfortable. I asked about making a burger a favorite way of mine and they said they would be happy to do it. They have additional seating inside and a larger seating area downstairs. Restrooms were clean and they had paper towels, which is always nice. To top it off, they take Amex. I think I can count on one hand the number of restaurants in Madrid that take Amex.

The burger is one of the best I've had (and I have made my way around the London burger scene) - great patty to bun ratio. Although there's slightly too much bread, it does mean that your last bite isn't just meat being held together by two tiny slivers of bread.  The menu is very simple burger-wise but oh-so-tasty. The only downside of tonight was the service - it seems that a lot of the waiting staff are new, but very optimistic. This did mean that our order ""got lost"" and we waited 25mins before we had to ask the manager what happened. He was very apologetic and gave us our milkshakes on the house which was very kind - however not before I shot him an extremely hangry look.

Despite their opening hours, the only libation served is alcoholic: beer, wine, and sangria (this is Spain, after all). No chairs here. After being served (it is pay-as-you-order), you are told to move away from the bar and go elsewhere to consume your tosta. No establishment could be more snooty. Yet I cannot come to Madrid without a pilgrimage to Capricho. Hence, I try and make sure my Madrid sojourn always involves a Sunday. Capricho is a family affair. As the name suggests, the proprietor hails from Extremadura, the southwestern autonomous community of Spain. Ramon the father is a bald-headed man given to non-stop histrionics. He is the life of the party. His wife and daughters help him manage the crowd and the extraordinary demand for their tostas. Tostas are slices of chapata bread onto which heavenly goodies have been piled on---like octopus, ham, bacalo, cheese, gambas...you name it. All finished off with a drizzle of the finest olive oil from, of course, Extremadura. 2 euros a pop. Not bad at all. Oh, when it is cold they serve a delightful broth for 1.50 euro, and also gazpacho...so it is not just alcohol after all.

The quality of the food was particularly good. My partner has sole which was a fish casserole. It was quite exceptional. We did notice on our last unsuccessful visit that the fish on guests' plates also look magnificent. This cafe is tucked away off Calle de Toledo, near Plaza Mayor but times we have been in the venue, the cafe was full. It suggested to us that the cafe relies on a regular Spanish clientele, although the staff were most accommodating in interpreting the menu into English for us. The staff were very helpful and friendly, particularly with respect to our very limited understanding of Spanish. El Capricho Extremeno has a particularly Spanish feel about it, from its decorations to the way that guests were obviously enjoying companionship with food and drink. It was as if we were dining with the locals.

The history of the building is fascinating and the decor was sympathetic to the history.  However the food was a bit of a let down. We decided to share a starter and had the ham croquettes. A pile of about 10 of them arrived with not a single bit of garnish. They were tasty but a little uninspiring.  I ordered the suckling pig which came with sliced potatoes but not a green vegetable in sight. There was a little bit of meat juice on the plate which prevented the whole dish from being completely dry. My husband ordered the lamb fest. Again with sliced potato’s. A pile of about 8 mini lamb chops in the middle of the plate. No sauce whatsoever. So they were very dry.  We didn’t order a pudding but they bought deep fried donuts free with the coffee. They were also very dry and inedible. With a bottle of red wine for my husband and 2 glasses of white for me the bill came to €110.

Two days before of our visit, we tried to make a reservation and here comes our serious disappointment. The only phone number was either busy or without anybody answering and moreover without any possibility to leave a message. After more than 30 calls ( my mobile might prove this ) we sent an e- mail following the suggestion of their web. Once done, we did not receive any answer back with the typical message giving any reason explaining that there are holidays or another more tragic responses. The chosen date at the time we made our reservation, we went to their premises and.....it was closed. No advice, no message, no signal . Another customer was suffering at the same time this circumstance and we could not understand the lack of respect to the customers when the day and the time were published as open in the web. It is not acceptable closing a business so customer oriented as a restaurant is without any notice with a proven diffusion in advance to the closure.

The dishes served here are originally from Asturias (northern region of Spain) so you can find a piece of it in Madrid to enlarge the variety of spanish products in your ""to-taste"" list. From the typical natural cider to its outstanding Cabrales (blue cheese). It is a place where the best option is to share the dishes and try as many as possible because all of them are delicious (specially the fabada and cachopo).

THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE If you want to have an extraordinary experience, where the real Sicilian food is served from the bottom of the Chef's heart, THIS IS CLEARLY YOUR PLACE. This is the third restaurant that I know Alfredo has initiated in Madrid and althought the previous two were great, this has the real touch, personal, intimate and incredible cuisine run by Aflredo and his wife. Dont bother checking the menu, the best thing you can say is Alfredo, bring me whatever you feel like it.  I may have eaten in this restaurant and in the previous two, maybe 30 times, and never have repeated the same dish. Alfredo's dishes are endless and you should not feel constraint by a simple printed menu. And remember you are paying for the food, not for the fancy place (which is not) or for the fancy furniture (which is not). Dont expect anything but a simple but authentic place, with no aspirations, but were you will be eating the best Italian food in town. as to the price, you can be paying something between 30 and 50€ but you eat much much better than in a number of Italians where you pay way over 80€",2016-09-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10431626-Reviews-Trattoria_da_Alfredo-Madrid.html,UID_35646,0.025,0.865,0.109,0.9547,0.26375,0.415297619047619,0.3824875,1213,115,0.0948062654575432,0,29,False,43,0.1111111111111111,0.1851851851851851,0.2777777777777778,0.0185185185185185,0.2037037037037037,0.037037037037037,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.074074074074074,0.0555555555555555,225,139,4.391111111111111,0,0,want fanci place run fashion chick dont care eat place want extraordinari experi real sicilian food serv bottom chef heart clearli place third restaur know alfredo initi madrid althought previou two great real touch person intim incred cuisin run aflredo wife dont bother check menu best thing say alfredo bring whatev feel like may eaten restaur previou two mayb time never repeat dish alfredo dish endless feel constraint simpl print menu rememb pay food fanci place fanci furnitur dont expect anyth simpl authent place aspir eat best italian food town price pay someth eat much much better number italian pay way,good review,4

Let me get right to the details. We opened with the red tuna tartar with a subtle ali-oli sauce on top and toasted bread with olive oil. Spectacular and fresh! The size of the plate for the price is a steal. We continued with Galician octopus, which was succulent and melted in your mouth. These first two plates were accompanied with a glass of Ribeiro and a glass of Albarino; both were elegant and refreshing, especially the Albarino, which for my tastes can sometimes be a bit too sweet. Then we ordered the tacos, which were the only thing I would order again. They were tasty but didn't stack up to the first two. It was our mistake. We then ordered a bottle of the Hisan, a young Ribera del Duero for 10,50, which was light but well rounded. The plate of the night was the oxtail rice with boletus. It was out of this world delicious. To finish a fantastic evening, we ordered the chocolate cake, which is a bit like a cheese cake brownie. It was served with raspberries on top and a little white chocolate reduction on the side. It was completely over the top. The service was attentive and friendly. I highly recommend this place to have a few tapas or go all out like we did and try several different plates.

This restaurant came recommended by one of the conference hoists and I'm so glad we took the advice. What a fantastic restaurant, simply divine food.  There were 8 of us dining on a Thursday night. We made a reservation for 21:30 but it was not needed which is quite surprising, you would think a restaurant this good would be packed every night. Service was very good and friendly, even though there was not much English being understood by the waiters. They do have English menus though, which made things a little easier.  We had a huge serving of bread with a blue cheese dip to start with. This was followed by a selection of tapas which included: artichokes which were done with ham; a simply amazing omelette made from ham, sausage and tuna - which looks and tastes nothing like an omelette, but is simply divine, I think this is the house tortilla, a hake omelette - which is more like a what you would expect from a tortilla; and the Hake's Napa with fries. We had a selection of deserts, all were great, but I had the Santiago Cake (Almond tort).  Everything was simply fantastic, all the food was done to perfection. We had several bottles of red wine to wash it all down with and quite a few coffees. We were given a selection of complimentary after dinner spirits at the end of the meal.

We have no reservation, however they were able to accommodate us after a period of 15-20 minutes. This restaurant was recommended to us by the local senoras in malasana and was told this is an excellent restaurant for traditional asturian dishes.  Well, this is my personal opinion. The place was very busy and all the tables were taken. We settled for a salad as starter to share. We weren't very hungry as we stop by mercado de san anton for a bit of galician marisco y pescado tapas and a glass of albarino. The blue cheese spread for the bread was excellent. The salad is just like any normal salad with tuna, tomato, onion, lettuce. However because my companion was in the mood for lamb chop cutlet, we settled for the lamb chop. Before ordering i asked the waiter whether the portion was big or not. He told me the portion was small, so we ordered 2 lamb chop dinners. When the order arrived i noticed the portion were quite large. With all the reputation i heard about this restaurant, i was quite disappointed when i bit into the baby lamb chop cutlet. All the cutlets were overcooked. Yes the cutlets were delicious if not for the overcooking. Of course i did not say anything as i did not want to create a scene. I do speak spanish and my companion is spanish. Maybe it is a once off thing as there were very busy. However i was extremely disappointed. I did not bother to order the dessert. My companion ordered the dessert and it was excellent. Will i go back to this restaurant? The answer is either no or maybe. I do not mind paying for expensive dinner as long as the food is good. But i do mind when the food is not to expectation.

We started with some excellent and misc. appetizer: tortilla, jamon (Spanish cured ham), tuna belly, clams, cheese and everything was well presented, fresh and promptly served. All the main dishes we ordered (beware of the large size) we also excellent. I personally had the filet mignon with French fries and the quality of the meat was top. Everyone on my party whether they ordered fish or meat were impressed with the quality of the food and its presentation. For dessert I had the lemon sorbet and the other desserts (we shared a few) were excellent too. Their wine selection is also great.

We ordered a Chinese mushroom mix, sauteed spinach, spring rolls, steamed dumplings ... and then followed by Japanese sushi of various kinds. Everything was extremely elegantly served and tasty at 100%. They must have some good chefs in that kitchen! We were served quickly and the restaurant was stylish, clean and quiet. Apparently it has opened recently in September 2015. The location is also great, only 3-4 minutes walk from the San Bernando métro station at Calle Sandoval, 18.

It was quite a scene! So when we saw the outside umbrella covered tables at Captain Alatriste, and an open table, we just took it, happy to get off our feet and have a place for a relaxing dinner. We were not expecting much by way of quality because of the scene that surrounded us, but we were happily surprised. The white cloth tables often are a cover for expensive food of dubious quality, but here, the environment was proper and predictive. The service is attentive and knowledgeable and they do not try to hurry you.  My wife got the roast suckling pig, which she had been looking for for 3 days, and it lived up to expectations. Perfectly done: juicy with crisp crackling. I do not want to overlook the amuse-bouche of a plate of small chicheron, which were the best I ever had. I know this sounds like a high fat place, suitable for a heart attack, but it has many seafood choices as well. The prices are reasonable and the wine is good and inexpensive.

However, following a few tips from the hotel staff, found my way to the bus and for € 3.6 made it to a Metro stop, which for another € 1, got me to the central Sol Plaza. From there, I was told it was a few blocks to the restaurant's address.  I eventually found my crew camped outside a café off some side street in downtown Madrid. And after a few rounds, we proceeded to the Taberna.  It was a very classic setting, in an underground cellar with foundations probably dating to the Renaissance.  I once again had the seafood dish.

One of our holiday pleasures is being able to eat outside on a warm night - not something we often get to do back home in the UK. I noticed one or two people had said in their restaurant reviews that it was hard to find a bad meal in Madrid & after our visit I would agree. Our meal here was good (we both opted for steak) & so was the wine (house). It wasn't expensive & we got to sit outside too so we left satisfied.

If you are seeking peaceful and away from the touristy tapa scrum then this could be as good as you would wish for in the centre of Madrid. However even with peaceful it is good to have some life in the form of fellow diners and passers-by, and this was short on both. All would have been forgiven had the food been as good as the prices implied. Sadly the smart presentation was not matched by the quality of the cooking. Another reviewer called it “insipid” and that is as good a word as any. For the main course, my wife had their Rape a la Bilbaina, which was large in size but bland in the extreme. It came substantially undercooked and had to be sent back; this took quite a while, by which time my unexciting Jarrete de Cordero was getting cold.

Everything is in place, and everything is very well kept.

Our evening ended with a cava toast for the new year (on January 16th) and a conga dance around the restaurant with fellow diners. However be very careful of what you order and request a English menu. We chose the mid range pre fix (~ 35E) that included 6 different plates between us). Two of the 4 savory plates included baby eels. The entrees had what tasted like canned sauces. Ice cream was a safe dessert option and my husband liked his apple pie.

First tip is: do NOT make the mistake of making a researvation for 9 pm. It too early for the restaurant main entertainment. One must go after 10 or even 11pm. That's when the action starts taking shape. The entire staff is very friendly and courteous. The waiter attending my table realised I did not know about the late schedule and even offered me a licor, so I could stay and watch the whole perfomace. Very nice of him. Also the manager, a sweet smile woman who I did not ask the name, was always approching me and the other guests to chat and make sure we were all enjoying the night.  Once the performaces started the moment was bliss. An experience really worth having. The singers are so entusiastic and connected with the people. Specially a slim bold guy who was in charge of anouncing the celebrations of the night. Like a couple celabrating their 50th wedding aniversary.  I had the Verdi menu. From it I had the salmon rolls and the langoustine as main. The food was simple, but tasty. I guess if you eat all kinds of meat you can vary more than me.

About half way through our meal the entertainment began. The classically trained singing wait staff would intermittently sing a variety of songs, arias, duets and a quartet. They all had wonderful voices, and related well to the audience. Despite the rather small number of guests present, the program was presented with enthusiasm and clear joy. Something special was in store the night we were there, as members of the Madrid Opera were among the diners, and joined in providing a musical treat! Two suggestions that might improve the dinner show: 1. Have the nonsinging wait staff respond more promptly to diners' requests. We had to wait and repeatedly ask for simple things. 2. Begin the main program a bit earlier.

We entered and because we were early we were invited to sit in the bar, which was a bit basic. Another couple and their children turned up and got out of the taxi and their faces said it all, they also thought it was looking closed. A few of the staff turned up, one man looked like the cleaner and a lady who was an older waitress. At 9pm we were told it was open so we were taken into a back room which was the restaurant. It was much nicer than the bar area. The man who looked like a cleaner served our drinks and the waitress and another waitress and the cook served the starter, then they stood around a piano which was in the dining room and sang opera......it was magnificent.

The menu isn´t huge but has a great variety of both cultures most popular dishes to satisfly everyones taste buds. My favorite dishes are served on Saturday and Sunday only...BRUNCH!!! From 12:00-17:00 they offer American style brunch that is to die for!!! I usually order the Eggs Bendict with (crispy) bacon and avacado (8,50 Euro). I have ordered other dishes such as Huevos Rancheros and Frech Toast only to be amazed by these dishes as well. Don´t let me forget about the 1 Euro Mimosas and 5 Euro house made bloody Marys. If you are in the mood for a hamburger then go no further. They offer a variety of differnet burgers, all with fresh ingerdients (7,50-8,50 Euro). The burger meat is flavorful and always cooked perfectly to order. The potatoes are hand cut and never frozen (you will be able to taste the differnece immediately).They stay close to their Spanish roots and offer many typical Spanish plates...my favorite being the Cecina de León ( beef salted, smoked and air-dried in the province of León for over nine months). The tostas are very moderately priced with fresh ingredients. My favorite is the avacado, mushroom and parmesan, but if I am really hungry I get the lacón (a delicious Spanish ham) with melted provolone cheese and quail eggs...amazing!!! They have Spanish and American style sandwiches that are huge and cheap. My girlfriend likes the smoked Salmon salad with pears and ginger dressing. I have lived in Spain for 2 years and traveled to most parts of Europe, and I would have to say that this is by far my favorite bar/restaurant. The service is always fast and friendly. The owner speaks perfect English and brings the kind of service you would expect in America to Spain...and trust me that is not easy to find!!!  One tip I would like to provide is that if you decide to come for Brunch, then it never hurts to call ahead and reserve a table because I am personally watching the popularity grow week by week.

I was there on a weekday evening so the restaurant wasn't full (probably about 20 diners in the building) but had a thoroughly enjoyable time. Even though I was dining alone, I was made to feel very welcome by the staff.  The food was excellent - delicious pasta stuffed with pear and gorgonzola and excellent duck with very thinly fried potatoes plus an excellent chocolate and almond cake. The entertainment complemented the food. I'm far from an opera buff (and some of the songs I didn't know - there were a few at the end that are so well known, you don't need to be a classical music fan) but the 4 performers were all excellent and engage with the diners.  The evening ended with a famous brindisi (drinking song) being performed along with a complementary glass of white. Well actually the night ended to a rather iconic, non-operatic song being played and the whole restaurant getting up and dancing to it which isn't something that happens at every restaurant. This isn't the cheapest restaurant in Madrid but the food was excellent and the entertainment was first class.",2017-11-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717266-Reviews-or20-La_Castafiore-Madrid.html,UID_35805,0.009,0.747,0.243,0.9966,0.4419047619047618,0.6944444444444444,0.46345,1225,110,0.0897959183673469,0,28,False,40,0.09375,0.234375,0.328125,0.0625,0.203125,0.015625,0.0,0.015625,0.015625,0.03125,219,136,4.584474885844749,0,0,final night solo trip madrid like finish nice dinner read la castifior made book weekday even restaur full probabl diner build thoroughli enjoy time even though dine alon made feel welcom staff food excel delici pasta stuf pear gorgonzola excel duck thinli fri potato plu excel chocol almond cake entertain complement food far opera buff song know end well known need classic music fan perform excel engag diner even end famou brindisi drink song perform along complementari glass white well actual night end rather icon non operat song play whole restaur get danc someth happen everi restaur cheapest restaur madrid food excel entertain first class,good review,4

Although opera is hardly the first type of entertainment that one associates with Madrid, La Castafiore has turned a pretty standard restaurant into dinner theatre. The waiters burst out every so often into famous arias, sometimes solo, sometimes in duets, etc. Although I am not an expert, the singing seemed first rate to me, and the evening was simply great, touristy fun. As a restaurant, the review is more mixed, as my seafood brochette was quite good but my wife's cod was absolutely drowned in sauce. If you are looking for fine food, take a pass.

I’m not very picky and I usually finish all of my food. I had the eggs Benedict which is usually my go to dish when ya my first time somewhere and it was very bland. I didn’t even finish them which is a shocker for me.

The food is good. Ok. Good. Not great. There are some locals, so there is a hip vibe, to a point. So many reviews in the travel guides has made this a tourist haunt which detracts from the ambiance. We just waited a half hour for a table. Perfectly reasonable given Carmencita’s popularity. But then we also waited an hour for our food. The table behind us, which arrived at least fifteen minutes after us, was done with their meal before we were even served. After no server had visited our area of the restaurant for twenty minutes, walked out with an “hasta luego” and an, oh, by the way, we’d be happy to pay our bill (happy is a relative term) if you’d like to give us the check. Servers are certainly pleasant and doing their best, but the whole thing just doesn’t work. Long story short, if you want to hang out with a bunch of Americans in Madrid, eat a relatively good brunch, and are patient enough to deal with what I think is fair to call a “service ordeal”, this is your place.

I had the crab cakes which looked more like a meatloaf but didn’t taste very good. Other family members had the pasta which was okay. I had the duck for dinner which was sub par. It was served with “potatoes” which in this case was canned potato sticks. My wife had the fish (bacalow) which was undercooked (3 at the table, all undercooked). The dessert was the highlight and that was average at best. I had an chocolate fudge cake with almonds - which was good. Other desserts - apple tartin, ice cream, and a condensed milk dessert - were also good.  The plate-ware, the glass-ware and the general decor of the restaurant all need to be worked on.  Our server brought the appetizers out and then the other three apps came five minutes later. The same thing happened for dinner and dessert. So three for three (or really zero for three) on the service.  Our dinner was supposed to start at 9 pm. They weren’t ready until about 930 pm. We left the restaurant at about 1 am. I have to think that more than an hour of the experience was singing - maybe 15 or more songs that were about five minutes each. You get a lot of singing and entertainment, which again is the highlight and the reason to come here. If you are a foodie and don’t love opera dining, this is not the place for you.  The singing experience is so extraordinary that I feel bad giving this review. I don’t believe Madrid is known for the cuisine but new lows were reached here on the food and service. The singing made up for much of the flaws but if they could get the food and service a bit better this restaurant would be the coolest dining experience in Europe.

The Capitan Alatriste is something of a dilemma. The restaurant building and the area in which it sits are steeped in history, swashbuckling heroes, sword-fights and derring-do. That is fine, and some bits (but not all) of the restaurant are genuinely old, but there is something of a tourist veneer to the whole experience, which is a pity. That said the service (from non-locals) and food were excellent, particularly the suckling pig which, along with the merluza, are the restaurant's specialities. The wine was fine, but more expensive than it needed to be for Madrid - 20€ for the house wine and up. So we did have a good meal in a pleasant setting, but there were few locals there when we ate - this again suggests that tourists are drawn more by the history than by the food. 91€ for three (main course plus a bottle of house wine).",2017-10-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1770178-Reviews-or30-Taberna_del_Capitan_Alatriste-Madrid.html,UID_35851,0.022,0.851,0.127,0.9595,0.2833333333333333,0.4638888888888889,0.6723857142857143,976,92,0.0942622950819672,0,30,False,34,0.074074074074074,0.2222222222222222,0.2962962962962963,0.074074074074074,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.037037037037037,174,112,4.614942528735632,0,0,number restaur madrid last week enjoy truli authent spanish dine experi capitan alatrist someth dilemma restaur build area sit steep histori swashbuckl hero sword fight der fine bit restaur genuin old someth tourist veneer whole experi piti said servic non local food excel particularli suckl pig along merluza restaur special wine fine expens need madrid hous wine good meal pleasant set local ate suggest tourist drawn histori food three main cours plu bottl hous wine,good review,4

After a delicious martini we started out with the Bellota Ham and Cured Loin of Iberian Pork.

I say next time because we will never stay in Madrid again without a visit to this wonderful restaurant. It is worth a visit for the friendly welcoming atmosphere and the wonderful performances of popular operatic pieces which even the most uninitiated opera novices (as my husband and I are) will recognise. The staff that evening were unique in that they included every diner in the restaurant to ensure maximum fun and involvement.

We ordered French toast, hash browns, mushroom goat cheese scramble, and the American breakfast all of which were delicious. The benedicts looked divine. They were served on bagels.

It has two levels, but still felt quite cozy. The food is unforgettable! Although a bit pricey, I can honestly say the price matches the quality. You get what you pay for. Service moved at a pleasant pace. We were a group of five with three of us being bilingual (English/Spanish). We didn't experience any sort of language barrier when we spoke in English. If it helps, the menus are in English and Spanish. For my entree, I had the grilled salmon. It was cooked to perfection and the portions were so generous!

Every time I return I hope that it will remain true to its principles and not sell out and become just another attraction for tourists.  La Castafiore is an opportunity to experience Opera at very close quarters with the waiters and waitresses literally singing for your supper. Let me make it very clear I did not know I was a fan of Opera until I was taken here. Whether or not you think you like Opera this is a fantastic opportunity to experience it close up. This is not only about the music as you are served great food while the show goes on. We started with foie between us as the portions are very generous followed by Prawn and Hake brochettes which were excellent. We continued through desserts and coffees as the show builds to its finally way past midnight. As this was a Saturday night and most of the guests being local the party continued till well after 2am. There is no doubt that you will enjoy the experience more if you speak Spanish as most of your fellow guests especially at the weekends will be locals, but do not let this put you off as the staff will do there best to help you enjoy your night. Booking is essential especially at weekends, this can be done by phone or through the website. Expect to pay around 150 euros for 2 with drinks which is fantastic value for a great night out.",2015-06-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717266-Reviews-or60-La_Castafiore-Madrid.html,UID_11036,0.011,0.79,0.199,0.9941,0.3095833333333334,0.5749305555555556,0.537909090909091,1381,140,0.1013758146270818,0,14,False,46,0.1454545454545454,0.1818181818181818,0.2727272727272727,0.0727272727272727,0.2363636363636363,0.0,0.0181818181818181,0.0181818181818181,0.0181818181818181,0.0363636363636363,258,158,4.352713178294573,0,0,trip madrid ever complet without trip la castafior everi time return hope remain true principl sell becom anoth attract tourist la castafior opportun experi opera close quarter waiter waitress liter sing supper let make clear know fan opera taken whether think like opera fantast opportun experi close music serv great food show goe start foie us portion gener follow prawn hake brochett excel continu dessert coffe show build final way past midnight saturday night guest local parti continu till well doubt enjoy experi speak spanish fellow guest especi weekend local let put staff best help enjoy night book essenti especi weekend done phone websit expect pay around euro drink fantast valu great night,very good review,5

It's a small corner bar near Malasaña with a relaxed atmosphere and vintage styling. The burgers are delicious with high quality fresh meat brought from the region of León. Unlike most Spanish bars/restaurants, there is also a great variety of salads. If you want something more authentically Spanish, try the cecina (also from León) and ask for a small plate of olives + a glass of wine. The tostas are yummy as well, my personal favorite is the Champis - sauted mushrooms with avocado and cheese on top a toasted slice of bread. Weekends are the busiest for an American style brunch so it's best to make a reservation or expect to spend some time.

There's no terrace, outdoor seating or special ambiance to speak of. Just a basic joint, which I don't mind as long as the food lives up to the hype. It doesn't. The owner / keeper has an English menu and speaks English, which is where the pros run dry. On the day of our visit their menu had literally four breakfast items to choose from, each a €8.50 ""Benedict"" consisting of a slice of toasted bread the size of a deck of cards, an egg, a meager piece of salmon (in my case), all drenched in hollandaise sauce, accompanied by deep fried pre-fabricated hash browns briquettes. If you expect nourishment to hold you over through a day of city hopping, don't. I'm not a glutton, but I have an athletic diet which requires substance. Even If I wanted to get something else, which wasn't booze, fat or sugar, there was nothing else on the menu, except another Huevo. An hour and €25 later we ended up looking for another place to eat. Preposterous. While at Carmencita I ordered two glasses of fresh orange juice and was treated to something which tasted like Minute Maid. When asked why we were served some yellow liquid from a can when the place had a perfectly fine juice making machine, the answer was ""I thought that's the kind you wanted"". There are 3,500+ restaurants in Madrid. To be ranked #17, the place has to be truly exceptional. In my opinion the most exceptional part about Carmencita Bar is how they were able to weasel their way to a such a prominent rating on TA. If you are the kind of traveler who seeks ""America"" everywhere you go, you'll be fine here. Just be prepared to pay twice as much for twice as little.

While the food was indifferent and the service hit and miss one came for the performance which never ceased to impress. That is until our last visit! The waiting staff are assisted by a number of ""resting"" or out of work opera singers who sing various arias from popular operas. Nor for the serious opera buff for sure but great fun for those who enjoy opera occasionally. Over the years they had a great formula which seemed to work brilliantly. That's all changed now. The new lead singers seem to want to denigrate any pretensions that this is serious opera. They even mocked one of their number who sang ""Happy Birthday"" in Italian to one delighted table in the classic pose with both hands clasped behind his back. That sort of behaviour should be left behind in the dressing room. The show finished off with a cringe making clap around to some popular Spanish numbers that have never been performed in an Opera House anywhere. So more Variety Show than Opera. Fair enough I suppose if you are aiming to please an audience of pre teen school children. Though even they I don't think would enjoy it.

However, the restaurant is composed of two separated spaces, that are in the same street, a few steps from each other, and share the same kitchen and similar interior design.

When we got there at almost 9pm the restaurant was empty and I mean no customers not one. Usually when I see a place that deserted i din go in at all but we were a party of 6 and it was cold , so we decided to stay. First they bought us an appetizer on the house small portions but full of flavor excellent!!!, the we decided to share some more appetizers squid on his ink which was extremely well prepared and cooked and a foie gra that was also really good. So Far All plates exceeded our expectations, then 3 of us decided to order the signature dish of the house which was Ternera Blanca, a piece of the calf of the cow slow cooked for 54 hrs on a bed of a truffle mashed potato, let me tell you it did not disappoint. the other 3 companions ordered the tartare which was also excellent. They were serving us very good food and we were so happy to be there, service was very good and they were paying attention to all of our needs. Desert came and shared 4 of them the creme brulee was ok but the texturas the chocolate and the cheese cake made from manchego was out of this world. By the end they finished our memorable meal with a piece of round crepe with a cube of a guaba on top that exploded in our mouths as soon as you had the bite.

Not a low budget restaurant, but definitely very good value considering the quality.  Desserts way above what is customary in Madrid - eg the apple pie. Wine list is short and modest, but extremely good value. A few minor blemishes.

We chose Hache based on the reviews, and had an absolutely wonderful experience. Two of us had the salad that consisted of arugula, mozzarella, mushrooms, and a very nice dressing. The mozzarella just melted in your mouth. Yum!! The other party had the croquettes, and they were delicious as well. We ordered four different deserts and shared them. I think my favorite was the homemade Mojito ice cream. It was so light and refreshing, perfect for the hot summer day. But don't get me wrong, the other deserts were absolutely scrumptious as well!

We really enjoyed eating here. The salad starter was fresh and crisp, the duck and cod mains we very much enjoyed, but we couldn't find the promised vanilla mash with the cod. We booked via the TA site, The Fork, which promised us 40% off our meal and we booked online for 8.00pm (which it says is when the restaurant is open - as does the dor sign at the restaurant. I checked their website too to get an idea of menu prices and saw that mains were about 17 -18 euro so expected 40% off that)  Arriving just after 8, we surprised one of the staff as she mopped the floors and she did not know we had booked. No, there was a mistake, the restaurant doesn't open until 8.30, come back then... So we came back then...and the menu looked promising but also told us that the prices on the menu were at 40% off... but everyone got the same menu so where were the ""real"" prices and who ever got charged those? It was a bit of a have, we reckon to advertise 40% off. Its really not, as nowhere are the full prices advertised, the mains were exactly as on the web.

We checked out the reviews using the TA City Guide App and decided to test out the restaurant. Based on the reviews I suspect there is a variation in the Txirimiri dinning experience depending on which location you visit. The inside of the restaurant is nice, bright with a welcoming open floor plan and upbeat music. The staff were helpful and more than willing to work with our lack of Spanish - which was much appreciated. The restaurant has a number specials written up on a black board which adds some important depth to the menu. While we enjoyed the atmosphere and service, fundamentally the food was not that good. The cannelloni noodle was too soft the accompanying sauce was luke warm (microwave?). The chef used far too much truffle oil on the ravioli which overpowered any of the other flavors in the ravioli (as well as the other dishes at the table). The highlight was cod tempura - nicely cooked with great flavor.

Danny was behind the bar and welcomed us in. We spoke with him and I ordered a Mojito and my daughter ordered a Bloody Mary. My Mojito was great (I am Cuban American, so well acquainted with a good Mojito), but the Bloody Mary was one of the best I have ever tasted!! Danny came over and told us his recipe with great pride - the ingredients were top quality and not the typical BM recipe - it was evident that he had done quite a bit of experimenting to come up with this amazing cocktail. It was so great to see the care he took.  We then looked at the menu and asked him for his recommendations. He was so helpful and it was very evident that he was very proud of their food, but most of all, he wanted to ensure that our experience was great! We ordered the ceviche, a salmon appetizer and some croquettes that I believe were Yucca - unbelievable how great each one was. The quality, care and pride that goes into each dish is very evident!  Francisco then came over and started chatting with us. My daughter and I do speak Spanish as a second language, but he was perfectly comfortable in English as well. You can tell there is great passion and pride in their food and drink and you also feel the care and concern in ensuring that your overall experience is excellent! Francisco and Danny made us feel so welcome and you could see their joy in the fact that we enjoyed and loved the food they carefully prepared for us!  By the way, the restaurant itself is beautiful! Distressed brick walls, exposed wood - beautiful and warm. Danny then brought us over a small post dinner drink - another amazing concoction that he made that was just truly amazing.  I love to cook and love fresh ingredients and Hache is spectacular. If you are in Madrid, this is a must do!! The restaurant is beautiful and warm, the food is fresh and excellent - it is evident that they take great pride in the flavors and ingredients that they present to their patrons - and Francisco and Danny were so warm and welcoming - it all combines to be an exceptional experience!",2016-04-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d9584882-Reviews-or80-Hache_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_35991,0.021,0.607,0.371,0.9997,0.4510984848484851,0.6363636363636362,0.4988249999999999,2202,210,0.0953678474114441,10,45,False,86,0.086021505376344,0.2688172043010752,0.3655913978494624,0.032258064516129,0.2043010752688172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043010752688172,0.0,413,211,4.324455205811138,0,0,leav royal palac lightli rain look place eat duck hach wow happi stop danni behind bar welcom us spoke order mojito daughter order bloodi mari mojito great cuban american well acquaint good mojito bloodi mari one best ever tast danni came told us recip great pride ingredi top qualiti typic bm recip evid done quit bit experi come amaz cocktail great see care took look menu ask recommend help evid proud food want ensur experi great order cevich salmon appet croquett believ yucca unbeliev great one qualiti care pride goe dish evid francisco came start chat us daughter speak spanish second languag perfectli comfort english well tell great passion pride food drink also feel care concern ensur overal experi excel francisco danni made us feel welcom could see joy fact enjoy love food care prepar us way restaur beauti distress brick wall expos wood beauti warm danni brought us small post dinner drink anoth amaz concoct made truli amaz love cook love fresh ingredi hach spectacular madrid must restaur beauti warm food fresh excel evid take great pride flavor ingredi present patron francisco danni warm welcom combin except experi,very good review,5

This is easily the best meal my husband and I have had in Europe over approximately ten years of travel throughout the continent. These are the reasons hache has to be on your to do list in Madrid.  1) customer service: Francisco and his staff are clearly passionate about what they do and are committed to making the customer experience a priority. Language was no barrier and our meals were carefully explained and suggestions for meals made well.  2) food: spectacular quality food prepared in modern and innovative ways. The combination of flavours and portion sizes were spot on. We left feeling fully satisfied but not bloated. We've been struggling to find high quality food in Madrid and finally found it at hache. 3) quality of drinks: do not miss the opportunity to have a cocktail at hache. The bar man is very talented and we were lucky enough to have him create some concoctions for us based on our spirit of preference. Interesting, well balanced, perfect!  4) ambience : as a new restaurant the interiors are warm, fresh, and inviting. We were looking for a quick meal and an early night but had such a great experience that we ended up staying for a few hours.  This review may sound gushing, but it's fully deserved.

Decided to find this restaurant away from the crowds after reading good reviews and we were not disappointed. We were welcomed in even though the restaurant was not yet open. The seating area was warm and comfortable and the owners made you feel as you were welcome in their home. Discreet jazz music instantly relaxed you. Food was truly delicious. I had the scallops followed by red tuna, my husband had the cheese selection and Iberian pork. Both followed with a tangerine and cava sorbet then an Irish coffee before going back out in the cold. Appetisers were gorgeous and even the bread was tasty. What sets this apart is that the owners and waiters seem to genuinely want you to enjoy their food and enjoy your evening. Some people may say the dishes are pricey however the meal was memorable and in hindsight offered great value for money. If we ever visit Madrid again we can only hope we can get a reservation.

The waiter was nice as is the decor. Unfortunately, the food is not what you would expect for the price ! My wife was served the wrong starter.. she received the salmon tartar instead of tuna! I had the meatball starter which was just plain halved meatballs with a small dash of sauce to cover. The mains was also a let down. I ordered the sea bass with oriental rice and my wife ordered beef cheek. The sea bass was drowned in soy sauce which killed any taste of fish while the beef cheek resembled a burger pate !

Unfortunately we chose Hache. Hache by name and hash by experience. This is a restaurant where style presides over substance and appetite for income presides over good service. This is the first time where we have been asked to leave without warning in the middle of our pudding to give way to the next customer on the conveyor belt of greed. The food was very mixed. The man in charge doesn't know what a marinade is. Please give the pheasant dish a miss this poor creature died in vain! Both main dishes contained no flavour whatsoever and were vastly over priced. My pheasant claimed to be in a ginger sauce. Sadly no vague presence of ginger was detectable. The meatballs were edible. I wish with hindsight I had left after them. Shockingly poor sweet choices too!  Having had such better quality food in London it makes one realise how bad everyday Spanish cuisine really is compared to France, Italy and Greece.

Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the owner, Francisco, who said it was either the best or worst decision we just made.  Long story short, it was the best. Let's recap.  1. We were originally a bit skeptical because of the 40% discount if you made your reservation through TripAdvisor. However, when the complimentary tapas was served, we were hooked. I can't really describe it and we both don't like goat cheese. However, we were so surprised that the cheese on it was in fact goat cheese. Wow.  2. We ordered risotto and ceviche, both were the best we've had on the trip. Portions were quite large as well. I ordered a small steak tartare which was good as well. Just wasn't a fan of the olives as I'm not an olive person.  3. We ordered the steak and Iberian pork. Omg, at 20 euros for the steak, before the discount, it was honestly one of the best steaks I've ever had. The Iberian pork, were incredible. We were a bit concerned about the very pinkish color, but were reassured it was okay to eat. Also, wow best pork ever.  4. Finally, although stuffed, we had to order desserts. We ordered the tiramisu and chocolate brownie. Incredible. These desserts do not leave you filling stuffed or bloated.  Ultimately, one of the best meals we've ever had in our lives. If there is no longer the discount, still make it a priority to go. The decor is homely and rustic. Photos are of Francisco's family and friends.

The prices are a bit higher than I expected, but I think it worths the experience itself.  Mind you the restaurabt is tiny. There are 2 small tables in the lower ground area next to the toilets. And luckily I was not sitting there. On the mid level between the ground and 1st floor there is a bar area and 4 high cabaret style tables. Definitely need a prior reservation. Apparently the chef is known and he is very good.  I actually was tempted by the photos of specific dishes in the trip advisor, however non of the dishes were available. Because the chef uses only seasonal products and those were not available. So they offered different dishes which were good! I paid 54 euros for 2 dishes with 1 glass of wine. I certainly recommend! However I still find it pricey. Not in comparison with others. Just for myself.

It is just off the main square in the centre of Madrid. There are different sections to the Restaurant, it seemed to have 3 sections, a place where you can sit and eat outside, another Restaurant just inside and a Restaurant at the back, As it was raining we went inside but to the back Restaurant which had a different more expensive menu. It was really nice but we asked one waiter if we could have the different Menu (the set menu - which obviously they didn't do in this section), his English was not very good but he said no and left us there. Then Maria came along and what a fantastic waitress, her English was perfect, she helped us and what a wonderful evening we had. It was our last evening in Madrid and we were so disappointed we hadn't found this Restaurant when we first arrived. Maria made our evening, she was able to help us with our choice of food. She was absolutely fantastic. I actually thought she must have owned the Restaurant and asked her if this was the case, but she said she just worked there. I would certainly recommend this Restaurant and hope you are lucky enough to have Maria serve you.

After a week of enjoying seafood, we all zeroed in on the word ""steak"" and decided to give it a try. You are right in the city center on their patio, but the street is quiet enough that you don't even notice all the hustle and bustle going by.  Service was fantastic and included many generous components ""on the house."" We started with complementary Cava and cheese and bread appetizers as well as a delicious soup. And rounded out the meal with more complimentary liqueurs than we probably should have been trusted with.  We all chose various steak entrees with my husband and I sharing the loin for two (which they were able to cook to both of our preferences!) and enjoyed a delicious red wine recommended by our server.  But the absolute best part of the meal was the dessert.

Made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived until we left, couple who run the restaurant were very attentive and were clearly passionate about their restaurant. Good wine selection and very reasonably priced too. We opted to share a starter of meatballs with goats cheese which was very tasty. Nice touch in between courses was the aperitif of shot of gazpacho with salsa and a plantain chip, unexpected but was bursting with flavour. My wife chose the sea bass dish for her main and after I tried we both agreed that this was the nicest well cooked sea bass we have eaten (we've ate a similar dish at Marco Pierre Whites restaurant). For myself I chose the pork dish which again was well cooked with some interesting flavours which I was more than pleased with. We were tempted to order a dessert by our host as he was passionate about their chefs homemade options so we opted for a tiramisu to share. Have to say what was sold to us was delivered as once again we received a delightful dish. All in all I would certainly recommend dining at this restaurant and is very good value for money.",2017-08-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d9584882-Reviews-or20-Hache_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_36069,0.0,0.772,0.228,0.9952,0.3557596371882086,0.669750566893424,0.2266777777777777,1208,118,0.097682119205298,0,18,False,42,0.1475409836065573,0.1639344262295081,0.3114754098360656,0.081967213114754,0.180327868852459,0.0327868852459016,0.0,0.0327868852459016,0.0327868852459016,0.0163934426229508,221,139,4.470588235294118,0,0,wife dine restaur book fork say realli good find made feel welcom moment arriv left coupl run restaur attent clearli passion restaur good wine select reason price opt share starter meatbal goat chees tasti nice touch cours aperitif shot gazpacho salsa plantain chip unexpect burst flavour wife chose sea bass dish main tri agre nicest well cook sea bass eaten ate similar dish marco pierr white restaur chose pork dish well cook interest flavour pleas tempt order dessert host passion chef homemad option opt tiramisu share say sold us deliv receiv delight dish would certainli recommend dine restaur good valu money,good review,4

I think there might be a few more restaurants with the same name elsewhere but this one is just right off the Puerta del Sol. We were welcomed inside by a friendly and super busy maitre D who kept an eye on all tables through the evening. The staff were attentive and very efficient. We have had an interest in restaurants in the past and it was evident this restaurant was run like a well oiled machine. We were impressed from the get go. When you sit down you are presented with a complimentary sparkling rose, a gazpacho refresher, a plate of plump green olives, fresh bread and a plate of cream cheese with small zwiebacks. My husband had blood sausage as entree which was soft and delicately spiced.This came with complimentary salsas.He ordered a glass of dry white house wine and a bottle of still water. His main dish was a sirloin steak and I ordered the house Speciality De Maria chicken with ham and mushroom sauce. We ordered a side of potato fries and steamed Brocolli and potatoes. Both main dishes were superb. We were completely full by now and refused dessert but we're given complimentary Mango sorbet smoothies(that's the closest description I can come up with) and small shot glasses of yoghurt and mango coulis. My husband had two further glasses of white wine and an espresso coffee and the whole meal came to only 73 euros which for two Aussies from Melbourne (one of the most expensive liveable cities in the world) was astonishingly good value. Please please try this place out and tell me if I am right about it. We loved it so much we are going back tonight for our final meal in Madrid.

It's really an Argentinian steak house, but we only had salad and pasta and these were very good. The staff were friendly, happy to be working there, and when we returned the waiter shook our hand to welcome us. When you sit down, you get a glass of cava, bread, melba toast with cream cheese, and olives, all gratis. We shared the quinoa salad, but really it was leaves, with a delicious mustard dressing, peeled prawns and cherry tomatoes. Fantastic.  For mains, my wife had the salmon raviola in a prawn sauce. It was superb, so good I was so jealous of it I wiped the plate clean with bread to soak up all the sauce, and then when we returned a couple of days later we got one each, it was so good. A bid rich, but what the hell, you're on holiday. You must order this dish. While we were eating, a table of Frenchies sat next to us, and I told them they had to try it. Three from the four did, and the one who didn't told me he wished he had too, after tasting his wife's portion. After mains, they bring you a lovely gratis duo of desserts, including a palate-cleansing sorbet. On our second visit I ordered the millefeuille, which I have to say was very disappointing - it was not a classic millefueille at all, and I really didn't like it or finish it. But don't let that put you off.

The service was exemplary, especially the nice touch of letting taste some of the wines before ordering them by the glass.  We ate at the bar, which was more than comfortable.

They took our order we opted for 2 steaks and 2 pasta dishes, to be on the safe side their medium is more like rare so a friend asked for it to be cooked a little more which they obliged. We had desserts but also received a complimentary sorbet and then 2 bottles of shots that you pour your self I smelt these and too be honest they were too strong after eating all the food but the table next to us drank both bottles!  We asked for the complimentary drink again (but to pay of course) and they brought us a bottle as it was to our taste and it was only 15euro  Altogether we had 2 courses each, wine and all the freebies for €120 which I think is great considering.

Beef was great, tender, cooked as requested, great taste, salt only, prime cut of Solomillo (filet mignon). Absolutely loved it. The restaurant is located on a relatively quiet street only thirty feet from a major avenue. They have covered outdoor seating on the sidewalk with water vaporizer system to fight the summer heat.

Having tapas every evening I craved pasta and I was happy to sit down and enjoy their aperitif (gratis), bread and a nice bottle of Rioja.

With there being so much choice we choice De Maria because the food looked so good from the existing tables and it was busy. The food was very nice indeed and even though there are more the 8000 restaurants in Madrid, we would return to De Maria. It's not the cheapest place in town and if you are on a budget then the welcoming aperitif and lovely bread does come at a price. Average price per head is around 40- 45€ for 2 courses and wine.  One comment on one of the waiter's. Not friendly at all and it was almost laughable how rude he was . Maybe due to New years Eve and holidays but the only down comment.

But the main attraction was the food - we ordered the full list of tapas to start with.

We ordered 2 glasses of house white which came with some good bread an an amuse bouche. I ordered the fish of the day which was hake - it was good but not as hot as it should've been. My husband's steak was one of the best. We were persuaded to try a special dessert which was custard like with a wonderful orange taste. We chose a bottle of crianza at €18. Complementary digestif was served. Then the bill appeared - which we had not asked for. It was €66. Rather unusual, but we paid and then saw that Jose was ending his shift. By this time (2130) there was only us and another couple in the restaurant area behind the bar. The owner spent much time chatting with the other couple, not once did he turn his head to neither greet us or ask if we'd enjoyed our evening. We thought this was poor from the owner of a new restaurant who by all accounts is supposed to be friendly and knowledgeable about wine.

After getting refreshed we decided to eat our main meal for the day with more drinks. Chose the ribeye. Delicious and very tender! No marbling and nicely marinated. It was quite salty, so if you are sensitive to that, be sure to ask them to hold the sprinkle added right before they serve it. Price for the steak is on the spendy side, but IMHO, it's worth it.

If you continue walking past plaza de oriente and past the palace gardens at the rear of the palace Hache sits not far from here on the opposite side of the road from the palace. What a treat of a restaurant to stumble across on our first night!  Firstly the owners were lovely! Welcoming us into their restaurant and by the time you leave you feel like you have made a new friend. The food is stunning and the drinks are great with decent prices for the quality you will see. The bar does everything from massive gin and tonics which come in balloon shaped glasses (something we found to be very popular in Madrid), great wines and one of the best sangrias in Madrid!  The food was so tasty, on our first visit we sat at the bar side of the restaurant sampling the tapas and drinks which were a modern twist on old tapas classics! So tasty and would highly recommend this for a late night snack. On our second visit we dined in the restaurant for lunch and had a larger portion of meatballs with a goats cheese sauce which we had the first time and enjoyed so much we had to go back for more. Then we had beef which was so tender and duck which was delicious.  Overall we would highly recommend this restaurant for its great and friendly service, amazing food, and great drinks.

Before we started, they brought out free bread and olives, and a free glass of jerez (sherry). We had a lovely dinner; everyone was pleased with their selection and then they offered dessert. We thought that we might walk dinner off and find dessert elsewhere, so we declined. Well, that is when they brought out not one, but two, desserts, on the house. Then they followed that with an after dinner liqueur. In all, they gave us five (5) items on the house. The waitress was so cute when she would bring it to us and declare, ""It's on the house!"".

We hadn't booked anywhere so decided we would have a look round some of the nearby side streets to see what was there. By chance we stumbled across La Vanduca. They had a table available inside and seemed very welcoming, as did the restaurant. Even better for a couple (us) who speak next to no Spanish, some of the staff spoke very good English. The tapas menu looked inviting so we made our selections. We were offered the option of having each dish in the order we selected but received a broad smile and a polite 'thank you' when we replied 'we don't mind'. Our waiter did urge us to have some bread and olives. Ordinarily we would pass on this but decided to have some anyway. Note to self, and anyone else for that matter......make sure you have the bread in this restaurant, it is sensational, and the olives too. We ate all of the olives, in pretty quick fashion I might add; they we so delicious. We'd ordered about half a dozen dishes and all, with the possible exception of the meatballs, were excellent. The meatballs were okay but it was probably more a case of the other five dishes being so good. Anyway, the following day we were downtown and when the discussion started about where we should eat it quickly became an easy decision....we'd go back to La Vanduca again, and so we did. This time we didn't have the meatballs and this time every dish was excellent. If we do go back to Madrid, its a no brainer where we will have at least one lunch.",2018-03-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8015602-Reviews-or10-Restaurante_La_Vanduca-Madrid.html,UID_36171,0.013,0.826,0.161,0.994,0.290546875,0.4819704861111111,0.35272,1578,154,0.0975918884664131,0,49,False,55,0.125,0.2083333333333333,0.3125,0.1041666666666666,0.1458333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0625,0.0208333333333333,292,188,4.407534246575342,0,0,wife spent morn wander around beauti buen retiro park work appetit book anywher decid would look round nearbi side street see chanc stumbl across la vanduca tabl avail insid seem welcom restaur even better coupl us speak next spanish staff spoke good english tapa menu look invit made select offer option dish order select receiv broad smile polit thank repli mind waiter urg us bread oliv ordinarili would pass decid anyway note self anyon els matter make sure bread restaur sensat oliv ate oliv pretti quick fashion might add delici order half dozen dish possibl except meatbal excel meatbal okay probabl case five dish good anyway follow day downtown discuss start eat quickli becam easi decis go back la vanduca time meatbal time everi dish excel go back madrid brainer least one lunch,good review,4

Now that we've eaten here, i have to say it would have been well worth the trip even all the way across town. Their olives were delicoius, and I highly recommend the tostas. We had the Tuscan burger and I have to say it was one of the most tasty burgers ive ever had (and im from los angeles where we boast a few amaZing burger joints). The staff was very nice and super friendly to tourists. It's a small space so it was quite crowded but we enjoyed the lively, energetic atmosphere. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT!!!!
