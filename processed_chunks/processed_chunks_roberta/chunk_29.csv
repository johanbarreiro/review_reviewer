What is missing in the description is the very affordable price for the experience compared to Madrid standards. My family and I had a great dinner last night. Service was so personal, rightly paced and warm. The interior is cosy Spanish. There are few tables, so I suggest to book one beforehand. Both fish and meat dishes and tapas were very well cooked and tasty. Cheeses are also extremely nice.  What differentiates this Spanish restaurant from other traditional ones in Madrid is that their menu has also Asian influences in some of their food proposals. And they are all cooked super well. The International tapas are so good, for instance.

We had shrimp (gambones) in a yummy sauce for 10.50€ and a small musaka for 3€. But our absolute favourites were the pork chops in a tasty sauce with potatoes (Solomillo Sur) and the shredded braised beef (ropa vieja) in the best sauce I've ever tasted. We used bread to soak it all up. Both dishes were available in half portions, as most of their dishes are as well. It allowed us to taste many varieties of tapas. My son enjoyed the salmon skewer with melted cheese on top. On our 2nd visit we noticed the board on the wall with daily specials so we ordered fish (9€) that came with mashed potatoes flavoured with broccoli which doesn't sound good, but was incredibly, surprisingly delicious. We also loved the paella which wasn't served in a traditional pan (so no crispy bottom) but was still excellent because of the sauce on it and the shrimp, baby octopus, fish and meat on it, 9€. Other highlights included the sangria 3€ with tons of fruit inside. We loved the red velvet cake (one of the best I've ever had). Sadly on our 2nd visit, they didn't have any more. We tried the strawberry cheesecake (4€) and while it was tasty, it didn't wow us as much as the red velvet did. Finally, I need to mention the exceptional service. Alex was the main person who helped us. His English is excellent and he is very welcoming. We also had another waitress (I didn't catch her name) whom my kids also loved. She spoke very good English and was so nice to us. We were greeted like old friends and given very good suggestions on what to order. My kids were given a little glass dish of gummy candies for dessert, I was given a free shot of wildberry liquor after dinner. Final points I forgot to add - bread was free here (you'll need it to soak up the amazing sauces) and they have English menus. Washroom (WC) was clean. So between the outstanding food and even better staff, this was the best dining experience we had in Madrid. I highly recommend that you visit and I'm not surprised they are ranked so high on tripadvisor.",2016-03-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2180-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_25345,0.032,0.716,0.252,0.999,0.3553930817610062,0.5516981132075471,0.40965,2096,180,0.0858778625954198,1,68,False,90,0.1,0.15,0.325,0.1,0.125,0.025,0.0125,0.0125,0.1125,0.0375,389,240,4.390745501285347,0,0,day madrid ate twice dinner good shrimp gambon yummi sauc small musaka absolut favourit pork chop tasti sauc potato solomillo sur shred brais beef ropa vieja best sauc ever tast use bread soak dish avail half portion dish well allow us tast mani varieti tapa son enjoy salmon skewer melt chees top nd visit notic board wall daili special order fish came mash potato flavour broccoli sound good incred surprisingli delici also love paella serv tradit pan crispi bottom still excel sauc shrimp babi octopu fish meat highlight includ sangria ton fruit insid love red velvet cake one best ever sadli nd visit tri strawberri cheesecak tasti wow us much red velvet final need mention except servic alex main person help us english excel welcom also anoth waitress catch name kid also love spoke good english nice us greet like old friend given good suggest order kid given littl glass dish gummi candi dessert given free shot wildberri liquor dinner final point forgot add bread free need soak amaz sauc english menu washroom wc clean outstand food even better staff best dine experi madrid highli recommend visit surpris rank high tripadvisor,very good review,5

Our company is called Culinary Crossings and we are traveling the world, to discover and try new flavors, while documenting, and experiencing other cultures & their cuisines. During the summer we had the opportunity of traveling to 28 different countries and over 100 restaurants throughout Europe over a span of 3 months interviewing restaurant owners, cooking with chefs and tasting traditional yet popular dishes native to the region.  We visited a restaurant in Madrid, Spain that not only specialized in creating local famous dishes but reinventing new ones so that guests get a unique dining experience after every visit. We were shown how to make sautéed squid with green beans and and balsamic reduction. Cod croquettes. And seared tuna with balsamic and sesame oil. Even though there was a slight language barrier when it came to sitting down with the chef and owner of the restaurant, no conversation was needed as the delicious dishes in front of us spoke for themselves. Not only was the taste and presentation of these dishes spectacular, the delightful ambiance was the icing on the cake during our visit to Taberna Rayuela.",2014-11-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3200440-Reviews-or50-Taberna_Rayuela-Madrid.html,UID_25346,0.016,0.888,0.096,0.9582,0.183354377104377,0.557901936026936,0.35805,1431,104,0.0726764500349406,0,23,False,35,0.109090909090909,0.1818181818181818,0.4181818181818181,0.0727272727272727,0.1636363636363636,0.0181818181818181,0.0,0.0,0.0363636363636363,0.0,234,164,5.115384615384615,0,0,team young american culinari profession texa passion food cultur excit love food driven us work toward develop greater understand food look histori cultur tradit techniqu behind dish compani call culinari cross travel world discov tri new flavor document experienc cultur cuisin summer opportun travel differ countri restaur throughout europ span month interview restaur owner cook chef tast tradit yet popular dish nativ region visit restaur madrid spain special creat local famou dish reinvent new one guest get uniqu dine experi everi visit shown make saut ed squid green bean balsam reduct cod croquett sear tuna balsam sesam oil even though slight languag barrier came sit chef owner restaur convers need delici dish front us spoke tast present dish spectacular delight ambianc ice cake visit taberna rayuela,very good review,5

This place had a modern twist on classic Spanish dishes as well as some non-Spanish dishes. For example, the patatas bravas were not fried, so a bit healthier than normal.  We split the following: - Salmorejo (amazing and super garlicky) - Salad el Sur (simple but good) - Patatas bravas (decent) - Mushroom risotto (special of the day) - Ropa vieja (mind-blowingly good - a Cuban might say it isn't traditional ropa but it was so so good my wife and I were having trouble sharing it) The only thing we found a little underwhelming and wasn't a big deal was the chips served with the ropa were soggy. That didn't detract from how good the rest of the meal was as well as the great service.  We seemed to be the only tourists in there and had a cool local feel as it is on a small side street. However, we were welcomed. I would definitely go there again.

It’s located in an historic building full of antiques, with soaring ceilings, oozing with charm. We began our adventure with rose champagne and they provided the first of many amuse -bouches. This one highlighted cod crisps with herb and seaweed accoutrements. They also provided an additional treat, served on a sculpture that simulated the symbol of Madrid; a bear eating the fruit from the Madrono tree. These delectables included a cod ball, a warm, liquid, lightly encrusted ham and cheese ball, and a sandwich of squid. All a pure delight!  Our sommelier and exquisite entertainer for the evening, Alboro, helped us select a lovely white; a Rioja, Que Bonito Casa Reaba. It was a full bodied white that reminded us of a Chassagne Montrachet. It held up perfectly with all the courses to come. This restaurant offers several tasting menus to suit the seasons and freshest ingredients available. What is also really accessible is there are ala carte offerings. You may choose half portions or whole portions, mixing and matching as you like. After discussing portion sizes, we ended up selecting two half portion starters and two half portion entrees. We chose the Gastronomia 2012 Bollota ham  which was perfect with the crusty bread and olive oil from the south of Spain. This was followed by a second half portion appetizer of Andignac foie gras medallion with duck juice and citric. AMAZING! This was also paired with a black truffle brioche dinner roll. The combination was perfection.  Proceeding onto our first half entree, we chose the turbot, served on a bed of samphire greens and spinach, with a fumet and toasted corn reduction. We chased this delight with a sake infused with a reduced fish bone elixir. Quite special and unusual. Turbot is always a treat if not over-cooked and this was among the best we have ever had.  What followed was a real surprise. Alboro asked us to join him upstairs, just off the kitchen. He shared two glasses of a fine dry sherry with us until Batiste, assistant chef, joined us in this circular room with a table prepped with an array of ingredients.  He served daikon two ways augmented with Japanese spices, seaweed and wasabi. Then, we sampled Spanish beef that had been dry aged and then marinated in miso for additional time. The final product was very “wagyu” like and delicious. What a special treat!  Our second half entree was Wild Roe deer loin. It was served with pineapple, mint and salsify. Cooked to perfection and quite remarkable.  We opted not to select a dessert from the menu, but the dessert cart of complimentary elegant sweets made an appearance anyway. You can’t go wrong! Fruits, chocolate confections, petit fours, gelees, and an amazing tiramisu with manchego could not be resisted.

The building outdoors is beautiful, (once construction is done in 2021 on Plaza de Espana an absolutely premier location but did not hurt the experience).   We arrived for our reservation with 2 other parties at opening time...9pm...late for us but normal for the Spanish. They obviosuly knew we were American and gave us our menu translated best as possible into English. (I am paying particular attention to this part of the review because I saw many negative comments on Trip Advisor about them not speaking English, sadly some forget they are in Spain.) They also asked if we preferred English or Spanish, we opted for them to speak to us in Spanish until we ask a question. The night contiued in ""Spanglish"" between us the servers, Maitre, and tableside cooks, a couple times they immediately went to English and then started over in Spanish after remembering our request. Quite fun. Wine list was extensive, and once we nearly finished our bottle the Maitre brought over a few more glasses of wine for us to try and decide what we liked to pair with final few coures. The night had started with a complimentary champage, and amuse bouche. Night finished with 3 courses of dessert and digestif. In between there were 3 tableside cooking presenations and the most unique presentation of a mussel cooked inside of a sour dough mini loaf. How did they even come up with that?  Alvaro the F&B director spent time at all of the tables and quite a bit with us. He walked us out to the cab back to our hotel and even gave us recommendations of restaurants in other cities wed be visiting.

He was amaizing from the beginning to the end. Unfortunately the food was average.  We had a couple El Club Alard dinners during our previous visit to Madrid (2012), and always remembered the experience as one of the best in Europe. This time we were underwhelmed by the number of dishes with unrefined ingredients: bread, pigeon, mussels. Funally, compared to our previous experience, the presentation of dishes is too basic.

Ah, the mussels: cooked just the right length of time and in a wine sauce that we greedily sopped up with bread.  Pigged all of this, and then suicided in the desserts, getting the creme brulee, the cheese cake, and the postre of the day. 2 bottles of wine, so had coffees to sober up (didn't work). Wiser, and sans our Dutch friends, we had the salmon tartar, a salad, and a bottle of wine (1), the second time. No desserts, still living on the fumes of the previous debauch.

The next two nights were as good as the first. I had three tapas which were very diverse, Spanish and International, and delicious. My wife had a hamberguese. This menu covers all the bases.  Another night we had salads. Now maybe these salads were to be shared, we didn't. I had a delightful tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad with balsamic vinegar. It was huge. Sally had a Caesar salad with chicken. We spent six weeks in northern Spain landing in and departing from Madrid. We had some very nice food in those six weeks. But this was a great way to end the trip. It is as if we saved the best for last. How they offered such a diverse menu at these reasonable prices I don't understand. Because I don't know about reservations or group meeting availability at Rayuelas I can't comment and I am afraid this will hold down the rating for this place.

This place was quiet but this was preferable for us having had a long day and just wanting to have a relaxed unhurried meal. This is exactly what this place seems to offer- the interior is relaxed and welcoming as is the service.  Both waiters who served us spoke some English and were both friendly and very attentive. The food was tasty, we ordered a selection of hot Tapas on a sharing plate between us plus bread which was just enough allowing us room to try the cheesecake for dessert which was delicious and a nice end to the meal. The prices were reasonable considering we had several drinks. I enjoyed our experience here and would recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a quiet, pleasant and relaxed meal.

We had a salad for starters, my boyfriend usually complains that salads are too simple to order in a restaurant but this one was totally worth it. The gnocchis seemed homemade (which seems to be rare these days), served with a creamy but yet light sauce and perfectly cooked asparagus. Also, i appreciate a vegetarian option in a Spanish restaurant, it doesn't always happen.  The service very attentive and quick too. The place itself is very cool, i really want to go back for cocktails on those comfortable couches! To give some constructive criticism: the bread was quite dry, i would like some fresh bread to go with such a good meal.

It is actually a bit hidden and far from the city centre, but if you have the chance you should come to this place. The food is so delicious. They are specialized in roasted pork and lamb. These are very traditional Spanish dishes. You will find it in many places in Madrid, but here they are really good quality and at a reasonable price.  I especially recommend the roasted baby pork or ""cochinillo"". It is advisable to book it in advance. They might run out of them if you don't make a reservation.

So, we did what everybody does and turned to Tripadvisor to find recommendations of restaurants nearby. The one’s for Havana Blues were positive and we decided to give it a try. In these days of flashy chic and sophistication, it is a real joy to find somewhere that has things of equal value, such as pride of the business developed and nurtured; of having people to dine as a guest instead of just another punter; of taking joy in knowing that the food provided is good quality and home-made; of being proud to belong to their country and in the good things it produces. All these were in abundance at Havana Blues. We were treated to a warm welcome and made to feel as though we were wanted guests to a humble establishment. I immediately got into the Cuban spirit and asked if I could try a good rum. My eagerness to try the Cuban national drink was rewarded by the owner enthusiastically wanting me to try his recommended rum. Nothing pretentious as a coxtail, simply a choice of with ice or without. And boy was it a good. Rather like having a very good singly malt whiskey, a drink with which I am much more familiar. My exposure to rum is limited and so I did not have a bench-mark with which to reference it, but I can say it was deliciously smooth and much more drinkable on its own, than say, Captain Morgan’s or Bacardi. It was a delicious drink. I now need find somewhere I can get some for myself!   The food was a treat. I had a lamb casserole with a special rice. Delicious. My wife and I shared a homemade cheesecake, again, which was lovely.   If you want flashy surroundings or authentic Spanish cuisine, go elsewhere. If you want something slightly different and are willing to forego prime location, then this is the place for you. The meal we had was more than just the sum of its parts; it was the whole thing put together by an owner who wanted to serve his customers and give them a good dining experience supported by good quality food. A real pleasure and I have no trouble in recommending this restaurant.",2019-05-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7622104-Reviews-Havana_Blues-Madrid.html,UID_25412,0.003,0.797,0.199,0.9974,0.3591843522331326,0.5368577763699715,0.3555666666666666,2118,201,0.0949008498583569,1,40,False,72,0.1157024793388429,0.1818181818181818,0.2727272727272727,0.0743801652892562,0.1735537190082644,0.0165289256198347,0.0330578512396694,0.0082644628099173,0.0826446280991735,0.0413223140495867,390,228,4.423076923076923,0,0,stay nearbi long day walk could face anoth treck everybodi turn tripadvisor find recommend restaur nearbi one havana blue posit decid give tri day flashi chic sophist real joy find somewher thing equal valu pride busi develop nurtur peopl dine guest instead anoth punter take joy know food provid good qualiti home made proud belong countri good thing produc abund havana blue treat warm welcom made feel though want guest humbl establish immedi got cuban spirit ask could tri good rum eager tri cuban nation drink reward owner enthusiast want tri recommend rum noth pretenti coxtail simpli choic ice without boy good rather like good singli malt whiskey drink much familiar exposur rum limit bench mark refer say delici smooth much drinkabl say captain morgan bacardi delici drink need find somewher get food treat lamb casserol special rice delici wife share homemad cheesecak love want flashi surround authent spanish cuisin go elsewher want someth slightli differ will forego prime locat place meal sum part whole thing put togeth owner want serv custom give good dine experi support good qualiti food real pleasur troubl recommend restaur,very good review,5

As others have noted, it’s a tiny restaurant with six or seven tables, which allows the owners and staff to mingle and talk through their dishes with their diners.  Our niece is adverse to fish and sea food so we focused on the meat with feet part of their menu. The Escabeche with the wild boar and the steak tartare were exceptionally made dishes and the sweet breads were the hit of the evening. You can order full and half sized portions, so the menu is geared towards sharing and trying different items. We are planning to go back to Madrid just so we can try the seafood portion of their menu.  Their wine list wasn’t extensive, but the selections were solid and reasonable, especially if you like Spanish reds.  All in all, a very memorable meal in a week of good eating in Madrid.

The service, done by the owners, is outstanding. Marian and her team make you feel at home.  The food, that is something out of this world. I believe the menu is well balanced. They offered to customize the plates in terms of quantity so we could try different dishes of the menu.  Salazones is one of their specialties. I particularly liked the Escabeche de Carne that usually is very subtle in flavour, which is very difficult to achieve on escabeches. Las Croquetas de Mar y Montaña were very good as well and Las Mollejas Salteadas en Ajetes are one of the best I have tried in my life.

This restaurant has very comfortable seating with an excellent staff and delicious food. By the time our journey through Spain had brought us to Madrid, my wife and I were getting used to the late dinners as compared to our usual (much earlier!) dinner time. This allowed us to enjoy the variety of dinner offerings at Cinco Jotas Serrano. The meal started with a generous and fresh garden salad served with a tasty roll. I then sampled a couple of slices of the Jamon Iberico which spoiled me during my time in Spain. Next up was a slice of the traditional “Spanish omelet” which was fluffy, rich and could almost be a meal in itself. This was served with excellent croquettes. For my entrée I had a perfectly braised slice of pork loin served with roasted potatoes. Even though I am not a big meat eater, I decided to try something other than fish and was very impressed with this pork loin. The meal ended with a slice of cheesecake. It was very good—a bit lighter than the “New York style” cheesecake that I am used to. It was a perfect complement to the filling dinner. I quite enjoyed my dinner at this restaurant which highlighted some of the culinary treats I fell in love with during my journey around Spain.",2020-04-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3396381-Reviews-Cinco_Jotas_Serrano-Madrid.html,UID_25423,0.0,0.818,0.182,0.9945,0.3233216783216783,0.5537004662004662,0.3306857142857143,1317,119,0.0903568716780561,1,21,False,58,0.1333333333333333,0.2,0.3666666666666666,0.0166666666666666,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0333333333333333,0.0666666666666666,0.0333333333333333,242,141,4.446280991735537,0,0,last full day madrid wife dinner restaur heart madrid restaur comfort seat excel staff delici food time journey spain brought us madrid wife get use late dinner compar usual much earlier dinner time allow us enjoy varieti dinner offer cinco jota serrano meal start gener fresh garden salad serv tasti roll sampl coupl slice jamon iberico spoil time spain next slice tradit spanish omelet fluffi rich could almost meal serv excel croquett entr e perfectli brais slice pork loin serv roast potato even though big meat eater decid tri someth fish impress pork loin meal end slice cheesecak good bit lighter new york style cheesecak use perfect complement fill dinner quit enjoy dinner restaur highlight culinari treat fell love journey around spain,good review,4

We were exhausted from sightseeing and just wanted to eat quick and go back and collapse so we said we'd be done before that. Five mins later we were moved to proper table for 2 and had til 10.30pm. Didn't matter as we were still gone by 9.30! We were both boring and had the same thing to eat (well it was Valentine's day I guess!). Chicken soup as we needed our reserves charged and Stirf Fried Chicken and cashews as it's always a favourite. The soup was larger than I expected but very tasty! The main was flavoursome and filling. We hadn't planned on dessert but we were presented with a carrot cake to share. Nice touch and very moist.

We strolled down Calle de Lagasca searching for a certain place one of them had seen in passing once, and take note of. It was Amparito Roca, still open and full of happy people. 'A theme blending music and literature,' I thought, 'what could be better for a musician writing stories in Madrid?' It evoked to me the charm of Les Bouquinistes on Paris' Left Bank. The staff were winding down for the night, but nevertheless welcomed us to wait a few moments until a table became free. During that time the chef himself engaged with one of my charming associates to devise an improvised array of dishes for us - based not just on the menu, but what we liked. The parade of courses were served personally by their author, and were each in turn a delight - right up to the cheese tray which featured a fruit paste that was a mystery to me. But the palate is able to transport one through a morsel's lineage to basic forms before infusions of sugar and other flavors, before cooking, back to to its elemental - even astringent? - reincarnation. As the paste itself dissolved into oblivion, it dawned on me...quince. This paste, Membrillo, I later learned, is quite universal in Spain, and the cheese had likely been a Manchego Viejo (mature Manchego) with its distinctive texture and rind. The two are commonly paired. With the sole exception of this quince paste and the cleverly engineered citric ""caviar"" which brightened the tuna tartare, every dish represented a handful of lovely fresh ingredients elevated to art. The chef, of course, was Jesus Velasco, of virtuoso simplicity and as it turns, renown to the Madrid restaurant scene. I thank him for imparting the secret of Jamon etiquette to this accidental wanderer, and his kind attention to our boisterous company. Perhaps the first visit to Amparito Roca was by lucky chance. The next will be by design.",2017-05-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10813898-Reviews-Amparito_Roca-Madrid.html,UID_25437,0.008,0.807,0.185,0.9972,0.1375396825396825,0.4655215419501133,0.2982111111111111,1968,158,0.0802845528455284,0,58,False,47,0.1538461538461538,0.1538461538461538,0.2948717948717949,0.1025641025641025,0.0769230769230769,0.0256410256410256,0.0,0.0384615384615384,0.1025641025641025,0.0512820512820512,345,235,4.707246376811594,0,0,one saturday night young friend demand go dinner late hour even madrid stroll call de lagasca search certain place one seen pass take note amparito roca still open full happi peopl theme blend music literatur thought could better musician write stori madrid evok charm le bouquinist pari left bank staff wind night nevertheless welcom us wait moment tabl becam free time chef engag one charm associ devis improvis array dish us base menu like parad cours serv person author turn delight right chees tray featur fruit past mysteri palat abl transport one morsel lineag basic form infus sugar flavor cook back element even astring reincarn past dissolv oblivion dawn quinc past membrillo later learn quit univers spain chees like manchego viejo matur manchego distinct textur rind two commonli pair sole except quinc past cleverli engin citric caviar brighten tuna tartar everi dish repres hand love fresh ingredi elev art chef cours jesu velasco virtuoso simplic turn renown madrid restaur scene thank impart secret jamon etiquett accident wander kind attent boister compani perhap first visit amparito roca lucki chanc next design,average review,3

Try the Escabeche de Jabali, or the Sepia and babh shark (cazon) meat balls, and ask Marian to pair your meal with whatever wine she may have in mind.

So I was mainly their as ""tour guide"". We all love good food and good restaurants. As most of the restaurants I used to go to in the Cheuca area have now closed since my last visit, I decided to try Bambubox on the Friday for the ""Menu del dia"" lunch. Had spring rolls to start with, which were very tasty and not like a lot of places which serve quite greasy ones. These were ""dry"", and with a nice dip. I had a main course of Thai red chicken curry, which had a great ""zing"" of chilli. Usually for Spanish tastes, Thai restaurants in Spain often tone down the chilli and other hot spices. With a glass of decent white wine and a mineral water, the bill was 14euros - great value for money I think.

Having lived in the UK for many years where we have an abundance of Thai restaurants even in smaller cities, Madrid is missing a trick here . Not all locals want tapas & chuleton every time they dine out. We opted to choose the degustación menu for 2 which offers 3 different types of curries - green Thai, yellow prawn & red beef with a bowl of steamed rice of €30,00. A little on the steep side of pricing I'd admit, but the food was tasty, hot, presentable and we were left satisfied.

We were staying in a hotel in the area and picked up the place following Tripavisor reviews. We ordered Poh Pla Sod as a started; these were a type of spring rolls which were basically cabbage and orange with little other flavorings; texture was not great either, a little crunchy and a little chewy. The waiter made recommendations and we changed our two initial choices for the main courses. The Chicken with Holy Basil was disappointed; presentation was unattractive, looking like a scramble of minced things; flavor was flat, just sweet and a little acidic; there was no umami, sourness or spice punch. The Pad Thai was just sticky rice ribbons closer to spaghetti bolognese than to Thai cooking and not very pleasant; I like my food and I just could not finish it. The decoration is modern and pleasant, so is the music played in the background. The service is also fine, although they failed miserably with the recommendations. I left the place wondering if they used us to get rid of the old stuff in the kitchen.

Received a confirmation call of the reservation the day before and understood that they had two seatings and that dinner was expected to take 2 hours so that the table would be ready for the next seating at 11pm. This is not uncommon for us and based on our past experience we expected that the service would be very efficient (as this is the way the restaurant can ensure that table turn). Well, not so in this case. First, it took us asking three different waiters to check us in and then it turned out there was a matre de’ who was chatting with another customer and thus did not acknowledge us right away (almost five minutes have passed). Then, the three of us were shown to a very small table (one for two people) that had three place settings but only two chairs. So we waited for a third chair to be found and delivered. Once seated, we waited another 10 minutes to receive menus. Once we received menus things sped up a bit and we ordered a number of plates and they began coming out from the kitchen at a reasonable pace. We ordered an additional copa de cava and the server brought out an un opened bottle and lost control of the opening and the cork shot past us, hit the wall and shot back barely missing us. After the sushi course, a waiter came by (there were many different waiters) and started stacking up the soya and wasabi dishes but one of our group wanted another plate of sushi. The waiter then informed us that we needed to be leaving soon and implied that we should not order more. We pointed out that we had only been there for 1:20 minutes (and remember at least 15-20 of that was waiting for them to be ready for us).  We let the waiter know that we were unhappy about being told we have to leave soon when we had not received all of our plates! We finally had all our food (and it was all very good food) but were not offered a postre menu. We asked for one, waited for its delivery and then waited yet longer to be asked if we wanted dessert. By now it was 11:00 pm and there were several empty tables available but we declined dessert, asked for the check and paid a bit over 100EU for dinner for three. We left the restaurant at 11:20, still what I think was a reasonable amount of time for a turn of the table, especially given the amount of time we waited for service. I have never had the experience of a server telling me in the middle of a meal that I needed to get ready to leave!  All of this is unfortunate because the food was very good. I would love to have this place on a return list the next time we are in Madrid but the service experience was so bad we will pass.",2016-09-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8629367-Reviews-or30-Restaurante_Ronda_14-Madrid.html,UID_25488,0.043,0.902,0.054,0.7195,0.0392490842490842,0.4863003663003664,0.323045,2688,268,0.0997023809523809,2,47,False,110,0.1573033707865168,0.0898876404494382,0.1797752808988764,0.0786516853932584,0.1011235955056179,0.0561797752808988,0.0337078651685393,0.0561797752808988,0.1348314606741573,0.1123595505617977,517,263,4.197292069632495,0,0,made reserv week ahead basi tripadvisor review receiv confirm call reserv day understood two seat dinner expect take hour tabl would readi next seat pm uncommon us base past experi expect servic would effici way restaur ensur tabl turn well case first took us ask three differ waiter check us turn matr de chat anoth custom thu acknowledg us right away almost five minut pass three us shown small tabl one two peopl three place set two chair wait third chair found deliv seat wait anoth minut receiv menu receiv menu thing sped bit order number plate began come kitchen reason pace order addit copa de cava server brought un open bottl lost control open cork shot past us hit wall shot back bare miss us sushi cours waiter came mani differ waiter start stack soya wasabi dish one group want anoth plate sushi waiter inform us need leav soon impli order point minut rememb least wait readi us let waiter know unhappi told leav soon receiv plate final food good food offer postr menu ask one wait deliveri wait yet longer ask want dessert pm sever empti tabl avail declin dessert ask check paid bit eu dinner three left restaur still think reason amount time turn tabl especi given amount time wait servic never experi server tell middl meal need get readi leav unfortun food good would love place return list next time madrid servic experi bad pass,average review,3

Not sure what the a la carte pricing is like but this was fantastic value. There were a good variety of courses, and the restaurant improvised rapidly to accommodate a vegan member of the group. Big portions - a lot of people declined the included dessert (they missed out, it was delicious!).  Helpful staff, if you don't speak Spanish then you'll get by. English language menus are available. We were inside with the aircon but there's a nice section on the street as well. Warning - lunch is not available when they say it is!

Food: As soon as we were seated, we were served with 2 pieces of mini size of crispy potatoes (on the house, we guessed) and 2 very small pieces of breads. We ordered 2 portions of salads with monkfish for starters, a sirloin steak and grilled scallops for the mains, a bottle of water and a large glass of house red. The salad and pickle monkfish was a disappointment. The monkfish tasted bland, the whole dish was too watery and the texture of avocado, mango and the pickle monkfish just didn't married well with each other. The sirloin steak was hilarious. I ordered a steak but it arrived in 3 pieces of mini thumb size of meat. It also came with some baby potatoes instead of french fries (as described on the menu). It tasted not bad but it's like a tapas instead of a main course. The grilled scallops was the joke of the day. They sliced each scallop into half and made it look like serving with 4 scallops. The whole portion (with rice) was less than 1/3 of the plate. When I showed the picture to my friends, they thought it was a tapas instead of a main cause because the portion was tiny! Service: The staff was attentive, as he tried hard to persuade us to order more throughout our meal, which we reluctant to, especially after eating the starters and the mains and we decided not to throw more money into the sea. I am surprised to see this restaurant is ranked so high up on Tripadvisor as this place was like a desert on the night we visited. We were the only customers in the restaurant throughout the meal. Price: All together, included service charge (I guess), came to 80 Euro. If we wanted to leave with full stomach, I believed it would cost 300 Euro or more. Overall, the foods didn't tasted too bad but they weren't outstanding. The biggest issue for us were the portions and prices. The portions were the same as the fine dinning's but Cinco Jotas wasn't a fine dining restaurant. The price was expensive too. I had never been to a restaurant which was so stingy on breads. The large glass of house red was only served 1/4 of the glass. Every dish was in cute size. It cost us 80 Euro but we were still starving when we left and had to find another restaurant to fill up our stomach.",2018-06-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3396381-Reviews-or30-Cinco_Jotas_Serrano-Madrid.html,UID_5893,0.053,0.872,0.074,0.9156,0.0915892857142857,0.4950119047619047,0.407404,2319,207,0.0892626131953428,1,59,False,94,0.0303030303030303,0.0606060606060606,0.1666666666666666,0.0909090909090909,0.0757575757575757,0.0757575757575757,0.106060606060606,0.0757575757575757,0.2272727272727272,0.0909090909090909,432,229,4.368055555555555,0,0,look medium price rang restaur near hotel accident came cinco jota food soon seat serv piec mini size crispi potato hous guess small piec bread order portion salad monkfish starter sirloin steak grill scallop main bottl water larg glass hous red salad pickl monkfish disappoint monkfish tast bland whole dish wateri textur avocado mango pickl monkfish marri well sirloin steak hilari order steak arriv piec mini thumb size meat also came babi potato instead french fri describ menu tast bad like tapa instead main cours grill scallop joke day slice scallop half made look like serv scallop whole portion rice less plate show pictur friend thought tapa instead main caus portion tini servic staff attent tri hard persuad us order throughout meal reluct especi eat starter main decid throw money sea surpris see restaur rank high tripadvisor place like desert night visit custom restaur throughout meal price togeth includ servic charg guess came euro want leav full stomach believ would cost euro overal food tast bad outstand biggest issu us portion price portion fine din cinco jota fine dine restaur price expens never restaur stingi bread larg glass hous red serv glass everi dish cute size cost us euro still starv left find anoth restaur fill stomach,average review,3

And yet, they have the time to explain the menu in detail, tell you about the ingredients used in the kitchen, and recommend the right wine for each dish. All without breaking a sweat. The menu changes with the seasons. In early Summer, we tried plump white asparagus from Navarra; home-made croquetas with egg, chicken and jamon; and a perfectly cooked rice with Spring vegetables, hare and foie. Each dish was perfectly cooked and expertly served.

It might be the best restaurant I've been to period. It's easily in the top 5. The Cuban Sandwich is perfect. The proprietor, Rafael, recommended an off menu appetizer with avocado and shrimp that was sublime. My buddy is a connoisseur of cheesecake, and proclaimed their guava cheesecake world class. It's the best cheesecake I've ever had. All that, and I haven't mentioned the people yet. Rafael is a tremendous host. It's obvious that he is a great boss, because all of the employees were in a great mood, and we went in on a slow Monday. They literally made us feel like family.

I couldn't have been more disappointed, though.  We ordered Tom Ka soup and a beef salad to start. The soup was served luke-warm, and lacked typical Thai ingredients most of the veggies there were onion and cherry tomatoes. The been salad wasn't bad, but maybe just because we were starving.  For mains, we got the Penang curry, and a red curry with duck. Both curries were also brought out not hot, at different times, after waiting about 30-40 minutes after we were done with the appetizers. When we pressed the waiter to heat them up, he returned after 2 minutes, making it very obvious that everything was reheated in the microwave.  As for the Penang curry: it was way, way too sweet (it's not supposed to be), and extremely greasy. How there was any oil in it at all is beyond my understanding. The beef was also dry, and the whole thing tasted like overly sweet nothingness.  The red curry with duck also was pretty flavorless, and very disappointing. I've spent nearly a month in Thailand, so it's not like I don't know what it's supposed to taste like. To be fair, the waiter was nice, but that doesn't make up for the fact that the food is bad. The owners should be embarrassed to serve such lame, re-heated food, especially given that the average dish on the menu will set you back 13-14 euros.",2017-02-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7995685-Reviews-or70-Bambubox-Madrid.html,UID_25597,0.089,0.809,0.102,0.4364,-0.0161904761904761,0.5886904761904762,0.3877928571428571,1373,125,0.0910415149308084,0,49,False,41,0.074074074074074,0.0925925925925925,0.2037037037037037,0.037037037037037,0.1666666666666666,0.074074074074074,0.074074074074074,0.037037037037037,0.1481481481481481,0.0925925925925925,247,169,4.5465587044534415,0,0,came restaur high hope read review disappoint though order tom ka soup beef salad start soup serv luke warm lack typic thai ingredi veggi onion cherri tomato salad bad mayb starv main got penang curri red curri duck curri also brought hot differ time wait minut done appet press waiter heat return minut make obviou everyth reheat microwav penang curri way way sweet suppos extrem greasi oil beyond understand beef also dri whole thing tast like overli sweet nothing red curri duck also pretti flavorless disappoint spent nearli month thailand like know suppos tast like fair waiter nice make fact food bad owner embarrass serv lame heat food especi given averag dish menu set back euro,bad review,2

To start...","I try not to write negative reviews, but we are still extremely upset by our experience at this restaurant that I had to share so that people who appreciate good thai food do not waste a night out in Madrid like we did.  To start off, service was horrible - we arrived at 8pm, right when they open and there was only one couple there with us until at least 9pm. It took forever to get our appetizers and we only got our entrees at 9pm. I like sitting and enjoying a meal, and generally don't like when my food comes out too fast, but the wait was ridiculous.  We had the beef salad which was the only thing we enjoyed even though the veggies were a bit soggy. We also had the tom kha kai soup which arrived at room temperature! We were in shock! Clearly they were heating up a pot that had been left over from lunch (hopefully not before that). It clearly wasn't fresh and didn't even have authentic Thai ingredients (it had cherry tomatoes and sliced onions) and had maybe 3 slices of chicken. On top of that it was 8.50 euros for an appetizer size soup.  We waited another half an hour for our entrees (which were not served at the same time as each other, nor were the entrees of the couple next to us served together) and the massaman curry came out cold also! When I handed it to the server to heat up I realized the bowl it was served in was hot meaning that they were taking premade food and heating it in the microwave! Our suspicions were confirmed when our red duck curry came out unevenly heated. I have never EVER been served microwaved food at a restaurant, never mind at a Thai restaurant where every curry should be freshly made in the wok for the customer! I am a huge Thai food fan and can eat it for every meal. I also prepare it myself at home. We were so disgusted and nauseated while we were eating. We should have left but were starving at that point that we didn't think about it until afterwards. Both curries were extremely sweet and the massaman curry was floating in oil.  On top of that, the bill came to over 45 euros. In the Thai food world, at that price you should be getting fantastic value for your money. I honestly have no idea how this restaurant is rated so well. I have never in my life had such a TERRIBLE experience at a restaurant.",2017-02-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7995685-Reviews-or70-Bambubox-Madrid.html,UID_25599,0.08,0.779,0.141,0.9842,0.0268480066445182,0.5923034330011072,0.5219409090909091,2273,230,0.1011878574571051,5,44,False,81,0.127906976744186,0.1395348837209302,0.2441860465116279,0.0465116279069767,0.1744186046511628,0.0697674418604651,0.0348837209302325,0.0348837209302325,0.1046511627906976,0.0232558139534883,434,237,4.2304147465437785,0,0,tri write neg review still extrem upset experi restaur share peopl appreci good thai food wast night madrid like start servic horribl arriv pm right open one coupl us least pm took forev get appet got entre pm like sit enjoy meal gener like food come fast wait ridicul beef salad thing enjoy even though veggi bit soggi also tom kha kai soup arriv room temperatur shock clearli heat pot left lunch hope clearli fresh even authent thai ingredi cherri tomato slice onion mayb slice chicken top euro appet size soup wait anoth half hour entre serv time entre coupl next us serv togeth massaman curri came cold also hand server heat realiz bowl serv hot mean take premad food heat microwav suspicion confirm red duck curri came unevenli heat never ever serv microwav food restaur never mind thai restaur everi curri freshli made wok custom huge thai food fan eat everi meal also prepar home disgust nauseat eat left starv point think afterward curri extrem sweet massaman curri float oil top bill came euro thai food world price get fantast valu money honestli idea restaur rate well never life terribl experi restaur,very bad review,1

This was disappointing as the table next to me must have arrived earlier and they had what looked to be a delicious plate of it.

There are only two waiting staff and then another one or two chefs in the kitchen, but the service isn’t slow. I was last here in August and knew then I would be returning - and no doubt, I'll visit in the future! To start, we shared the Bambubox platter – and it was just as good as I remembered. The mango salad in the centre is definitely one of my favourite things; it’s just so refreshing and perfect for cleansing the palate after the deep fried appetisers and chilli dipping sauce. We all ordered a main course and I can wholeheartedly recommend the Kapao Talay (mixed seafood with basil, pepper and chilli). The chicken with cashew nuts, was also really lovely. The chicken had definitely been marinated in soy and honey, as it had sweet, sticky glaze and sauce. And I also have to mention the Kung Pad Pang Kari instead. This was a yellow curry, packed full of langoustines and was absolutely beautiful. It was another mild dish, fragranced with coconut – and I loved the sauce, which was quite thick but stuck to the rice nicely.

The food is traditional, fresh and delicious. It isn't fussy which I love but if you want something more interesting rather than straightforward but wonderful perhaps go elsewhere.  We had sliced tomatoes (which were already on the table but we were asked if we would like them), tomato bread, chips and fried eggs, green asparagus (very good crisp served with salt and lemon), clams (touch salty for my liking) and garlic prawns, steak and complimentary petit fours. The steak for two was excellent and is a large portion you could easily share it between 3 people. The steak continues to cook at your table as it comes on a hot plate. When the plate cools you can ask for another one to continue cooking it. The garlic prawns were also a stand out juicy fresh and not overcooked.  If you're in the mood for traditional high quality food executed well this is the right place. The waiters were friendly and there is an English menu.

The menu is in Spanish only and the waiters did not speak much English and we don't speak Spanish. But he was fantastic. He spent a lot of time explaining each menu item to us so that we could understand. He really went the extra mile including describing the beef rib eye with a ""moo"" and a gesture to his ribs. In the end, we (2 people) shared an octopus starter and got the gnocchi and rib eye streak as mains (I don't remember the Spanish names unfortunately but just try mooing and pointing at your ribs). Oh my gosh they were all delicious! I must have said ""suculento"" like a hundred times. The steak was definitely one of the best quality meat and cooking I've ever had in my life. We also got two desserts - the crème brulee and the carrot cake. These were also very nice, but certainly for me, the highlight of the meal was the steak. At the end, it came to about €54 for the whole thing including a glass of wine and water and they were generous enough to give us a couple of shots of a delicious citrus fruit digestif with the compliments of the house with our bill. All in all not a cheap place, but well worth it in my opinion.

Looking at the reviews on Trip Advisor they were really good and thought we would give it a go. We read that it is a very Spanish local restaurant and not much English is spoken. Which...is true! Already on our table when we sat down was a platter of lovely looking tomatoes in olive oil which looked delicious and then they brought over a plate of tomato soaked bread in oil and garlic. We tucked in and it was delicious - it took AGES for them to come and take even our drinks order. I wanted a glass of Sangria but they would only do a jug so we ordered the jug which was fine - really good Sangria.  Our waiter then started speaking Spanish to us which we didn't understand but we soon found out that he was asking us whether we wanted any ham. He put down a plate of cured ham and then left again - so, we started tucking in - it was great. We eventually ordered our main courses and we said how we were glad that actually they hadn't come over earlier and we had ordered starters as they were giving us so much food at our table!! We ordered the chips and eggs which others had recommended and it was great but we received it before our main courses. We then received our meat dish which came with another side of plain chips and it was all just so dry!!! I had escalope and my husband had lamp chops. A Spanish couple on the next table had an amazing sizzling steak which looked and smelt really good which they shared between themselves and another two tables also had the steak! The downside of not being able to speak Spanish I guess! I was so full up by the time we finished our meals so we didn't have dessert and just got the bill. To my absolute shock and horror they had charged us for the tomatoes, the tomato bread and the plate of ham. The tomatoes were 3 EUR, the bread 6 EUR and wait for it....the ham was 24 EUR!! It was literally a plate of the same cured ham (not a selection of meats) so our bill came to 110 EUR! I was so angry but I had to let it go as I couldn't argue in Spanish. I have never been to a restaurant where they give you appetizer food and made you pay for it. It really made me think whether they charged the Spanish for it as they knew we were tourists. Don't get my wrong - I don't expect everyone to speak English in their own country but equally, help us out a little!

Without a reservation, we arrived a little early (13:10) then were offered to sit outside for 10mins., a couple glass of cava came with a tapas while waiting, then admitted to a table as the first guest for the lunch of the day. Meal was exceptional as always, with Jamon Iberico, fries with eggs, tomato salad and meat (sirloin for me, tartare steak for wife) with a bottle of Proto Ribera del Duero. It was the service, however, that was as good as the meal and impressed us the most, despite that we just spoke no Spanish. I may be wrong, but I think the gentleman who was preparing tables and chairs when we arrived was Mr. Lucio, the owner, and the cavas nor tapas were not charged when the bill came in.

All the previous positive reviewers are right on: the service is impeccable, the recommended house wine excellent and reasonable and — most important — the food is simply outstanding.

We got there the minute they opened and the place was nearly empty. Within fifteen minutes, it was literally packed. All meals apparently begin with fresh thinly-sliced tomatoes in olive oil. We placed these on pieces of fresh-baked bread that were covered with a thin layer of tomato-garlic purée, onto which we added olive-oil soaked iberico. Sounds simple, but this starter was foodgasmic, especially when combined with the 2007 Valbuena (canNOT recommend this wine highly enough). We proceeded to devour delicious razor clams, then to entrees of steak and sea bass. Mind blowing. We ordered flan for dessert which was preceded by scrumptious complimentary sweets and a liqueur made from grape skins and various herbs. This was one of the best meals I have ever had in my life.

The restaurant is small and had nothing in particular about the decoration. It looks more like a fast food restaurant. Upon arrival, we were asked whether we needed Spanish or English menu. We responded Spanish. Two minutes later, a waiter who did not speak Spanish made an effort to understand our Spanish. He later made a mistake with the wine, which he had previously opened at the bar, before showing it to us for confirmation (this was something you do not usually see at restaurants, moreover when you order a bottle of wine). He brought the correct one order afterwards, but one more time, opening it at the bar before bringing it to the table. We had questions about the dishes listed on the menu, which he was able to answer in a ""Spanglish"" way. We decided to speak in English to him, but he did not speak English very well, either. We order a starter sampling, which included 8 pieces of 4 different dishes, which were OK, nothing special about them (we had been to Bangkok and other Thai restaurants in the US). We also ordered a seafood dish, which included 8 pieces of seafood with red and green peppers, a little bit of cilantro, and it was served on a small bowl, so did the Pad Thai, which only included 2 shrimps and a little bit of egg. Yes, 2 shrimps. We did not realize about it until we searched through the noodles. In addition, the Pad Thai looked lit it was previously cooked, and heated before serving. We ordered it and it arrived about 2 minutes later. The flavors were average, and did not impress us. We told the person who billed us about the Pad Thai and the number of shrimps included, but he laughed and said he would comment this to the chef. In addition, the waiter never came back to the table to serve the wine. Another lady cleaned the table besides us after the customers finished having lunch, spraying a large amount of cleaning product on the table, which was not nice, as we were eating and trying to enjoy the wine. We mentioned this to her, but she did not say anything. The prices were high compared to the amount of food and/or quality/complexity of the meals served. Moreover, when you take into consideration that there are many options in the area, offering Spanish food such as octopus, gambas, and navajas at a much lower price. As being a Tripadvisor user, just checked it to find restaurants near where we were and that's how I found it, and decided to give it a try due to its punctuation/rating. I will not recommend this restaurant.",2015-10-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7995685-Reviews-or140-Bambubox-Madrid.html,UID_333,0.033,0.927,0.041,0.6221,0.0889718614718615,0.3234469696969696,0.3158791666666666,2607,235,0.0901419255849635,0,70,False,117,0.08,0.16,0.36,0.02,0.22,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.1,0.04,472,260,4.52542372881356,0,0,read good review restaur husband decid lunch visit madrid restaur small noth particular decor look like fast food restaur upon arriv ask whether need spanish english menu respond spanish two minut later waiter speak spanish made effort understand spanish later made mistak wine previous open bar show us confirm someth usual see restaur moreov order bottl wine brought correct one order afterward one time open bar bring tabl question dish list menu abl answer spanglish way decid speak english speak english well either order starter sampl includ piec differ dish ok noth special bangkok thai restaur us also order seafood dish includ piec seafood red green pepper littl bit cilantro serv small bowl pad thai includ shrimp littl bit egg ye shrimp realiz search noodl addit pad thai look lit previous cook heat serv order arriv minut later flavor averag impress us told person bill us pad thai number shrimp includ laugh said would comment chef addit waiter never came back tabl serv wine anoth ladi clean tabl besid us custom finish lunch spray larg amount clean product tabl nice eat tri enjoy wine mention say anyth price high compar amount food qualiti complex meal serv moreov take consider mani option area offer spanish food octopu gamba navaja much lower price tripadvisor user check find restaur near found decid give tri due punctuat rate recommend restaur,average review,3

We came here because of the good reviews and the high ranking in tripadvisor. The interior of the restaurant is fancy, similar to many other bars and restaurants in this part of the city. What it lacks is a feel of authenticity. We got seated on one of the two large tables to be shared with other guests (we arrived without reservation and this was the last space they had available). We ordered Tom ka kai, Som tam tai and Kaeng khiew wan kai. The first disappointment about the salad was that they did not have green papaya and instead offered to make it with green mango, which the waiter said didn't make much of a difference. Unfortunately, the mango turned out too soft and sweet, which ruined the salad for me. The soup was unbalanced and too sweet, and had too much onion. The green curry was not exciting, I was missing basil and lime leaves, it also contained carrots, peppers and zuchini which were misplaced to my taste. The waiters were friendly, although they could have been more attentive. The kitchen was very slow. I was much happier eating at Thai orchid, which is also in the area.

We walked for 15 minutes before finding the place down a quiet side street off the Gran Via in a really unassuming location. The restaurant itself is really beautifully designed inside, however, with great lighting, modern decor, and a really lovely atmosphere with some softly playing classical music.  My friends weren't great lovers of Thai food and/or were pretty inexperienced with it, but I'm so glad we came to Bambubox and tried it out. In terms of food: I ordered some vegetables rolls that came with a sweet chilli and peanut dipping sauce to start, and one friend ordered a sort of curry soup - both were delicious and really simple, with great flavour. For a main course, we all ordered a chicken variation of Pad Thai, and when my friends asked for no oyster sauce both the chef and waitress were really accommodating to their request. For desert I ordered the mango sticky rice in the hope that it would be as delicious as the authentic dish I'd had in Thailand earlier that year, and my friend ordered the tapioca pudding. Though she was a little disappointed with hers - thinking it lacked any outstanding flavour - mine was really delicious. The portion sizes for each meal were really well thought out, and were wonderfully authentic with modern twists (e.g. the presentation), and the many available dishes on the menu all sounded delicious.  The staff were really attentive to our requests throughout the evening, and spoke great English when our poor Spanish failed us. They helped us to order a taxi when we asked, and gave a great description of the dishes on the menu when we asked for some guidance. Overall, a great meal with a lovely atmosphere and a perfectly peaceful end to our week trip in Madrid!",2015-08-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7995685-Reviews-or150-Bambubox-Madrid.html,UID_25704,0.046,0.68,0.274,0.9986,0.3053661616161616,0.5769931457431456,0.46635,1805,138,0.0764542936288088,1,39,False,73,0.0947368421052631,0.2105263157894736,0.2842105263157894,0.0736842105263157,0.1473684210526315,0.0210526315789473,0.031578947368421,0.0210526315789473,0.0526315789473684,0.0631578947368421,316,190,4.708860759493671,0,0,two friend turn bambubox thursday even around pm walk minut find place quiet side street gran via realli unassum locat restaur realli beauti design insid howev great light modern decor realli love atmospher softli play classic music friend great lover thai food pretti inexperienc glad came bambubox tri term food order veget roll came sweet chilli peanut dip sauc start one friend order sort curri soup delici realli simpl great flavour main cours order chicken variat pad thai friend ask oyster sauc chef waitress realli accommod request desert order mango sticki rice hope would delici authent dish thailand earlier year friend order tapioca pud though littl disappoint think lack outstand flavour mine realli delici portion size meal realli well thought wonder authent modern twist e g present mani avail dish menu sound delici staff realli attent request throughout even spoke great english poor spanish fail us help us order taxi ask gave great descript dish menu ask guidanc overal great meal love atmospher perfectli peac end week trip madrid,average review,3

At the end we were too full for dessert so Angelito decided we shouldn't leave without trying the variety pastelitos and sent us a platter free of charge!

I know it’s a little over the top, but the food here is to die for. It is true that the restaurant is a little hard to find, but hey, the goods in life don't come easily. The restaurant is very traditional, as others have alluded to, with the decor not very modern and the walls covered with pictures of all the stars that have visited (a bit tacky), but it adds to the whole experience. For me, however, I like that in a restaurant as it builds a sense of a unique character and special ownership. Obviously, the above is nothing without fabulous food. So let me begin with the perfectly sliced «jamon iberico» (ham). I absolutely adore this, it was perfect. It was coupled with the most fabulous tomatoes I have ever tasted (which were lightly salted with some olive oil). I could have died happy at that moment. Alas, I had to eat on. The next course followed with a sizzling, perfectly cooked steak. It obviously came on a hot plate, which was good for those who wanted to cook their steak a little more – as the steak was very rare. For me it was perfect. Coupled with some Churrasco, I was set and a little salad if I remember correctly. Be honest, I can't remember the rest, as I had died and gone to food heaven. I need to thank my friend again, who now lives in Madrid, for this magical experience.

The restaurant is just off Gran Via and is so easy to find – the restaurant name is on the front windows and from the exterior, the restaurant looks inviting. Once inside, the decor is incredibly modern, with a blend of simplicity and Oriental features. Origami lotus flowers adorn every table and the main feature is the bamboo ‘palm tree’ in the middle of the restaurant, which extends to the ceiling. We began with the Bambubox starter platter, which consisted of their most popular starters, with accompanying dips. There were five gorgeous little morsels to try and I quickly dug into the first: a steamed dumpling, filled with minced pork and vegetables. I’m a big fan of dim sum, so quickly followed it up with the chicken and vegetable pastry dumpling, which had that gorgeous coconutty ‘Thai’ flavour. The spring roll was light and stuffed with crunchy vegetables – and went so well with the chilli dipping sauce. I loved the chicken satay too, but the highlight had to be the centrepiece: a cold raw papaya salad, topped with peanuts.  We then all chose a main course each, with the intention of having sampling a little bit of everything. Each main course comes with a portion of sticky rice, but there are also other types of rice (and noodle dishes) available. Luckily, everyone picked different dishes, with everyone except me choosing curries. My uncle picked the Kaeng Ped Yang: a red duck curry with vegetables, which was fairly mild in comparison to other red curries I’d had before. It was also quite sweet, which I enjoyed. My auntie opted for the Kaeng Khiew Wan Kai: a hotter green curry, packed with chunky pieces of chicken and vegetables. My mum chose her favourite Thai curry, the Masamam Nua: a beef massaman, with potatoes and cashew nuts. I was late to trying that one, but the beef was beautifully cooked, so soft. I decided on the Kapao Talay: stir-fried seafood with basil and pepper. Unlike the curries, there was no thick or creamy sauce and instead the herbs and spices provided all the flavour. There was a decent mixture of coated fish and seafood (including king prawns, squid and mussels) and it was all cooked to perfection.  I’ll finish by complimenting the service. I think there were two waiting staff and just one person in the kitchen, but everything was efficient and our server was so lovely – and passionate about his job. After hearing so many good things from my family and reading reviews online, I’m so glad Bambubox lived up to expectations and I know I’ll definitely return.",2016-10-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7995685-Reviews-or90-Bambubox-Madrid.html,UID_25618,0.011,0.817,0.172,0.9976,0.1659084249084249,0.574492673992674,0.4267454545454545,2653,200,0.0753863550697323,1,64,False,53,0.1294117647058823,0.1647058823529411,0.2941176470588235,0.0705882352941176,0.1294117647058823,0.0235294117647058,0.0352941176470588,0.0588235294117647,0.0588235294117647,0.0352941176470588,459,284,4.777777777777778,0,0,famili member recommend bambubox glad lover thai cuisin certainli disappoint restaur gran via easi find restaur name front window exterior restaur look invit insid decor incred modern blend simplic orient featur origami lotu flower adorn everi tabl main featur bamboo palm tree middl restaur extend ceil began bambubox starter platter consist popular starter accompani dip five gorgeou littl morsel tri quickli dug first steam dumpl fill minc pork veget big fan dim sum quickli follow chicken veget pastri dumpl gorgeou coconutti thai flavour spring roll light stuf crunchi veget went well chilli dip sauc love chicken satay highlight centrepiec cold raw papaya salad top peanut chose main cours intent sampl littl bit everyth main cours come portion sticki rice also type rice noodl dish avail luckili everyon pick differ dish everyon except choos curri uncl pick kaeng ped yang red duck curri veget fairli mild comparison red curri also quit sweet enjoy aunti opt kaeng khiew wan kai hotter green curri pack chunki piec chicken veget mum chose favourit thai curri masamam nua beef massaman potato cashew nut late tri one beef beauti cook soft decid kapao talay stir fri seafood basil pepper unlik curri thick creami sauc instead herb spice provid flavour decent mixtur coat fish seafood includ king prawn squid mussel cook perfect finish compliment servic think two wait staff one person kitchen everyth effici server love passion job hear mani good thing famili read review onlin glad bambubox live expect know definit return,very good review,5

We found Bambubox on TripAdvisor based on reviews. When we first walked in and sat down, we thought the place was very nicely decorated. It was a Tuesday night and there were only 2 waitstaff, which seems enough since there were only 6 tables occupied. The waiter was nice and took our order in English. We ordered their Bambubox appetizer (an assortment with 2 pieces of appetizer and their mango salad), Pad See Yew, Green Curry and 3 glasses of their house white wine. The food and wine was soooooo delicious. We especially love their Pad See Yew. The best we ever had and we probably tried all the Thai restaurants in New York.

Original dishes with colour and taste presented with style and creativity.  As for the service, they were discreet and professional. I was a bit scared about the English skills (noting some complaints of previous guests), but a couple of them were able to serve in correct English.

I ordered the smaller of the two tasting menus - only 10 courses instead of 14 - and the wine pairing of 8 glasses of wind (this was a concern since I normally drink 2 glasses and on special occasions 3).  As each course was served it was explained by the waiter who was wonderful about any questions I might have and then the wine was explained by the Director of Food and Beverages - all the wines were from Spain. The food was beautifully prepared, unique, tasty and the wines well suited. (I do like wine and have a palate which allows me to observe the unique bouquets and essences of various wines) I was quite pleased with all of the selections.

I had the suckling pig, which was fine and my partner had pigeon which she loved. Everything was slightly strange, in a good way. My labeling this experience as eccentric is due to the music sound track in this elegant expensive space which was based on the Bee Gees and the Eagles etc which was jarring.

Unfortunately it appears our genies were not baby lobsters, but lobster abortions trapped for weeks in their dry, black, bread bun prisons and had resorted to emanating a strong fishy stink as a call for help. From there on, it was just one disappointing fish dish after the other. Whilst the presentation was commendable, the execution was far from satisfactory - the fish being more like something slimy & textureless that you'd slurp at a yum cha than expect to be plated up at a Michelin 2-star. Just when we thought we'd escape from the stagnant fish tank, then 'sea rice' turns up. Not really sure how to describe this, other than green cochineal coloured fish-stock flavoured thickened rice. It just doesn't work. But wait - there was yet more fish to come. My partner booked our table months ago & advised staff she was 'pescatarian'. It would seem they interpreted this as 'pescadorian' as after ALL that fish, all the supposedly talented 2-star chefs could dredge up for the crowning glory of the dinner - the main - was yet MORE fish, this time a pan-fried slice of turbot with vegetables so salty as to be barely edible, reminiscent of what might be served on a business class flight on some sub-par Russian government operated airline.  By this time we were in hysterics, and me down $100 on losing the bet that they wouldn't dare bring another fish course out - and expressing thus to our poor waiter, who was clearly aware of our high levels of fish discomfort. So in closing, this will be a memorable night and the source of many very inappropriate 'fish' jokes - and all because of the food.",2017-06-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or50-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_25772,0.082,0.822,0.096,0.5671,0.06484477124183,0.4621568627450981,0.5330076923076923,1951,154,0.0789338800615069,0,57,False,48,0.1265822784810126,0.1139240506329113,0.2025316455696202,0.0379746835443038,0.1518987341772152,0.0379746835443038,0.0379746835443038,0.0379746835443038,0.1645569620253164,0.0886075949367088,342,232,4.704678362573099,0,0,twa promis first cours went hill second cours arriv ensconc glass kettl eman stream co arous high expect littl geni releas bottl would grant culinari wish particular geni name babi lobster head bake squid ink bun unfortun appear geni babi lobster lobster abort trap week dri black bread bun prison resort eman strong fishi stink call help one disappoint fish dish whilst present commend execut far satisfactori fish like someth slimi textureless slurp yum cha expect plate michelin star thought escap stagnant fish tank sea rice turn realli sure describ green cochin colour fish stock flavour thicken rice work wait yet fish come partner book tabl month ago advis staff pescatarian would seem interpret pescadorian fish supposedli talent star chef could dredg crown glori dinner main yet fish time pan fri slice turbot veget salti bare edibl reminisc might serv busi class flight sub par russian govern oper airlin time hyster lose bet dare bring anoth fish cours express thu poor waiter clearli awar high level fish discomfort close memor night sourc mani inappropri fish joke food,very bad review,1

My husband is not into anything too avant-garde so that narrowed down some choices. A draw for me is chef Maria Marte. She is not only the only female chef in Madrid with any Michelin stars but her story of starting off as an immigrant dish washer and now worked her way up to the head chef is awesome.  The restaurant is very close to Plaza Espana and the royal palace. You enter a building in the corner and it doesn't seem quite like a restaurant from the entry. The dining room is light in color, tons of space between the tables for privacy. It's certainly a posh place and I recommend a jacket for the men.  There are 2 choices for the tasting meals, a shorter 10 course ""Rendezvous"" and a longer 14 course ""Seduction"". We opted for the later. The wine list was also extensive and to be honest really reasonable priced for this caliber of restaurant. We saw a lot of bottles priced around 50 euros, and I don't think I saw any quadruple digits (at least not in the Spain section anyways). Our waiter helped us pick up 2 bottles of Spanish red that are less well known but were both fantastic. Ended up being cheaper than getting the wine pairings. Ok now the courses: Starters: - Smoked Eel with Coconut - My husband usually does not like eel and he loved this dish. The eel is very light in flavor here but the smokiness and coconut flavors paired well. - Red King Prawn Bombon - Looks like a Godiva truffle but even prettier. Interesting but slightly fishy for us. - Shot of Butter Fish and White Asparagus - Wow, I was expecting fishy because it's well a shot of fish, but the flavors were awesome, lots of umami. - Quail Egg and Truffle Cupcake - The playful ""classroom"" theme started here. I made the mistake of biting the cupcake in half and dripped the delicious filling all over, what a waste! Haha. - Norway Lobster - Man oh man, this was by far the best bite of shrimp/lobster/crawfish spectrum of shellfish I've ever had. Just incredibly tender. I could make a whole dinner out of this for sure. Best bite of the night! - Comte Cheese Soup - A nice soup, was just ok relative to rest of the menu. - ""Sea Rice"" - A painstakingly chopped up piece of calamari made to resemble a line of rice, lots of sea flavors. - Venison with Chen-Chen Sand - Probably my least favorite of the meal, the venison was somehow on the mealy side for me. Main dishes: - Baked Turbot - Excellently cooked piece of fish with sauces of seasonable veggies on the side. - Wagyu Picanha - Super tender beef and a very rich and flavorful sauce. Desserts: - Hibiscus Flower and Pisco Sour - Almost too pretty to eat! Tasted just like pisco sour. - Cheese in 2 textures - Less memorable of the desserts - Creamed chocolate - A couple different consistencies in this plate made it interesting. - ""Blackboard"" - The signature ending here. A bunch of sugar candy things that you can actually write on the board with and eat. Fun! During the dessert course, they brought us an extra big board of sweets to eat with our fingers because it was our anniversary celebration. Really awesome! Overall, we had a fantastic meal here with fabulous food and wine. The service was also top notch. While not every single bite was WOW, there were many that were very memorable. If each bite was sensational, then I would expect 3 stars, but to be honest, I haven't had that at 3 star establishments either. But we certainly appreciate the excellent cooking and a good amount of creativity. And for the caliber of the food? I think the price is a steal compared to the US restaurants!",2017-06-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or50-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_25773,0.024,0.76,0.216,0.9995,0.2933553791887125,0.5319896384479718,0.4067533333333333,3647,285,0.0781464217164793,6,117,False,103,0.09375,0.15625,0.2890625,0.0625,0.1640625,0.0390625,0.03125,0.0546875,0.0703125,0.0390625,673,403,4.417533432392274,0,0,alway book splurg meal trip decid club allard spain vacat husband anyth avant gard narrow choic draw chef maria mart femal chef madrid michelin star stori start immigr dish washer work way head chef awesom restaur close plaza espana royal palac enter build corner seem quit like restaur entri dine room light color ton space tabl privaci certainli posh place recommend jacket men choic tast meal shorter cours rendezv longer cours seduct opt later wine list also extens honest realli reason price calib restaur saw lot bottl price around euro think saw quadrupl digit least spain section anyway waiter help us pick bottl spanish red less well known fantast end cheaper get wine pair ok cours starter smoke eel coconut husband usual like eel love dish eel light flavor smoki coconut flavor pair well red king prawn bombon look like godiva truffl even prettier interest slightli fishi us shot butter fish white asparagu wow expect fishi well shot fish flavor awesom lot umami quail egg truffl cupcak play classroom theme start made mistak bite cupcak half drip delici fill wast haha norway lobster man oh man far best bite shrimp lobster crawfish spectrum shellfish ever incred tender could make whole dinner sure best bite night comt chees soup nice soup ok rel rest menu sea rice painstakingli chop piec calamari made resembl line rice lot sea flavor venison chen chen sand probabl least favorit meal venison somehow meali side main dish bake turbot excel cook piec fish sauc season veggi side wagyu picanha super tender beef rich flavor sauc dessert hibiscu flower pisco sour almost pretti eat tast like pisco sour chees textur less memor dessert cream chocol coupl differ consist plate made interest blackboard signatur end bunch sugar candi thing actual write board eat fun dessert cours brought us extra big board sweet eat finger anniversari celebr realli awesom overal fantast meal fabul food wine servic also top notch everi singl bite wow mani memor bite sensat would expect star honest star establish either certainli appreci excel cook good amount creativ calib food think price steal compar us restaur,very good review,5

Well - we have eaten in quite worse two M Stars and for sure there are one M Stats restaurants in Madrid that do not catch up with Club Allard. To start with the sommelier Alvaro , he is still one of the leading sommeliers in the spanish capital. Curiosity and profound knowledge sometimes even of the visited vineyard itself is just fabulous. Staff in general very friendly and always helpful. They make you feel that you are here to enjoy yourself. Winepairing this time as Alvaro always surprises us. What a joy. Thank you for showing the world that spanish white wines can be a fabulous option for a world class menu. Solo 2.016 from Lebrija outstanding. And of course food in Club Allard is still worldclass and climbing up the MStar ladder is always possible. Lets start with making more variety of bread. One class of bread is not enough. Mar and Montaña snacks-surf and turf -very nice. Oyster Amelie with white butter icecream a delicate bite. Wildmushroom infusion and slow cooked egg nice but be advised that a little bit too much of that palo cortado ( sherry alike) might ruin the delicate flavour of the mushrooms. Turbot excellent but may be still a little bit too common. A certain “something” is needed. May be the hirezake? Yes -but we did not like it. We would have preferred a good sake without the fishbone emulsion. The cook was working on Tokyos Ginza before.....ok we understand. The suckling pig was one of the best ones we ever ate. Desserts very good but may be a little bit more fantasy on the patissiers side would be needed.  All in all a great food and of course wine experience.

She brought all the diners out a small taster from the kitchen which was a nice touch and it was absolutely delicious! We decided to go for the prawns & garlic, the quiche, the jamon plate and the goats cheese salad - all of which were amazing, especially the quiche!

The pace was high from the start with Beef Tartare and Eel. Appetizers are delicious and small, Creamy Comte soup fast to follow, Sea rice is green and salty, Waguy beef from Austria tasty. Pre-dessert a beautiful surprise (no spoiler here). Dessert a pleasure to the eye but not extensive, so my expression “It is in the sweet kitchen, that the kitchen shows its true strenght” points Club Allard where to invest more in order to fully demonstrate its capabilities.  One comment on wine pairing. It was a very good example of why to go with wine pairing, since it offered a series of interesting wines carefully selected from a wide range of Spanish wines from North to South, east to west, white to brown to red.

The menu was uneven, some dishes were very good, some were not to the standard of 2 Michelin star restaurant. Exceptionally good was the cold cherry soup with hering caviar, the quail egg and truffle cupcake. Generally the starters and the amouse bouche were good standard. The mains for us were blend without much creativity. But the biggest problem was the rhythm of the service. All dishes were following eachother within minutes. It was impossible to finish the matching wine with each course or to be able to enjoy the food and the drink together.  The wine pairing itself was excellent, carefully selected.

But with this comment out of the way - I have to say this is one of the most fantastic dinners I have enjoyed in a while! It is very inventive cuisine served imaginatively and unusually - and the flavours ands ingredients are amazing. We opted for the gourmet menu with pairing wines. The sommelier was totally charming and extremely enthusiastic and offering a full and informative description of every wine. The wines were a perfect match too for every course and there were a lot of them! All the wines were Spanish and some were local from Madrid. It was a memorable experience to be taken through to the chefs table - meet the chef and be guided through a couple of dishes by an enthusiastic and charming sous chef. Other dishes are prepared at the table by different chefs.

The service was impeccable, the dishes amazingly tasty and their selection of wines out of this world. The sommelier was one of the best we have seen, making recommendations that were true, rather than trying to sell you an expensive bottle that may or may not enhance the flavors. At the end of the meal they asked the 3 of us to climb a small set of stairs to see the kitchen and introduce us to the chef.

Unfortunately, she is no longer at helm of the restaurant.  The service is still excellent, however we thought that menu price was higher than before (last time we were there was in October 2017).  You can now choose a la carte menu or choose one of the 2 tasting menus at €115 or €145. We chose the one for €115 and we believe the food we had does not justify the price we paid.  Some dishes were disappointing. Mainly the Cresta de Gallo (rooster comb) which our opinion was tasteless. I love tasting exotic / unusual food as long as they are tasty. This was not the case. Another disappointing dish was Coca de Atun (tiny pieces of raw tuna) which had a very fishy unpleasant taste. The tuna had a ""compota de tomate"" which tasted just like a watery apple juice. One of the Sous chefs comes to the table to finish the dish and explain it. I know many will be impressed by this presentation, but the dish itself was very disappointing. We loved the Pechuga de pichon. Outstanding! The foie gras and goat cheese was very tasty. In summary, in our humble opinion, El Club Allard is no longer outstanding. The tasting menu price is for a 2-star Michelin star restaurant, but food we had was not worth of a 2-star Michelin restaurant.",2018-04-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or30-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_508,0.084,0.84,0.076,0.0976,0.0789221272554605,0.6415384615384616,0.6064444444444443,1364,124,0.0909090909090909,1,36,False,42,0.08,0.14,0.28,0.0,0.12,0.0,0.06,0.02,0.18,0.12,254,156,4.362204724409449,0,0,probabl th th visit el club allard past year huge fan cuisin chef maria mart unfortun longer helm restaur servic still excel howev thought menu price higher last time octob choos la cart menu choos one tast menu chose one believ food justifi price paid dish disappoint mainli cresta de gallo rooster comb opinion tasteless love tast exot unusu food long tasti case anoth disappoint dish coca de atun tini piec raw tuna fishi unpleas tast tuna compota de tomat tast like wateri appl juic one sou chef come tabl finish dish explain know mani impress present dish disappoint love pechuga de pichon outstand foie gra goat chees tasti summari humbl opinion el club allard longer outstand tast menu price star michelin star restaur food worth star michelin restaur,average review,3

We did not go to Madrid because of it, however it is worth a return trip to see what new dishes they have come up with since then. Sadly, we did not see this restaurant listed on this year's top 25, which is a shame. The building does not give away the treasure it hides inside. There are no huge neon signs to let you know that you have arrived. There is a gold plaque with the club's name, once you go inside. I love this air of secret exclusivity a lot. This restaurant is by reservation only (or was in 2016) and I booked way in advance to avoid disappointment.  You can choose from a couple of set menus or go a la carte. We both opted for Menu Revolucion and were not disappointed. The decor, ambiance and food screamed elegance and class. The food was incredible and service impeccable. We had a couple of business cards with El Club Allard propped up on glass holders set and waiting for us at the table. They turned out to be edible (and delicious), whether dipped in the sauce that was brought over right away, or not.  The many plates that kept on coming were gorgeous and bearing tiny pieces of delicious food art. At first glance, one may think that they will not satiate one's hunger, but that could not be further from the truth. We left with eyes and bellies full! The restaurant itself has an air of exclusivity and made us feel like royalty. Everything was tasteful and elegant and our very expensive lunch was worth every penny! This meal, along with our dinner at Funky Gourmet in Athens, has been one of our most memorable (late) Valentine's meals. Would highly recommend you treat yourself to the experience! Word of warning: When the sommelier came over to take our wine order he asked if we prefer red or white. We responded that we love either and would like his recommendation on which one to have with the dishes from the Revolucion menu. He said he knows the perfect Spanish white to accompany some of the courses and a great Spanish red for the remainder. We said we'd go with what he suggested, expecting a glass of white and a glass of red each to sip on with the various courses. What we did not expect was that we had inadvertently agreed to a bottle of each. We are no big drinkers, but the wines were every bit as delicious as expected, even at 45 euro per bottle.  I believe we took 4 hours to finish our lunch (and wines!) and even though we were the last ones to leave, at no point were we made to feel unwelcome or rushed.

It is small (so make reservations in time!), but has a nice atmosphere. The staff is attentive, and speaks English well. The menu is outstanding, the dishes beautiful - sometimes spectacular - and in just the right portions (although the pace is somewhat high - which makes sense if you have 7-10 courses). The sommelier is knowledgeable and picks unusual wines (like the one from Canary Islands).

We had spent the previous 8 days enjoying its bounty. Madrid was the last leg of the trip, a late switch of plans to take in the football. The least I could do was to take Mrs MM for a sumptuous dinner. It was a steamy evening towards the end of August when we dined at El Club Allard. We'd made an effort, all dressed up & somewhere to go. The taxi dropped us at the wrong end of the street, never mind, a few minutes later we were out of the heat & being warmly greeted. We were seated, offered an aperitif, whilst they were attending to the drinks, we were offered both the menu & the wine list. We opted for the 10 course tasting menu to be accompanied by an excellent bottle of Rioja. The plus points were the standard of service, the staff were polite & engaging, the dinner room was spacious,the tables weren't too close together. The dining was full there was a hum to the room. The negative, the food, whilst cooked and presented properly it lacked a certain je ne sans quoi, I found it dull and uninspiring. Normally, Mrs MM is more expressive than me, the odd umm & ahh gives you a hint all is well, but nothing. I'm sure it was a world tour, a fusion so to speak but I did not get it.

We arrived with very high expectations given the superb reviews here in TripAdvisor (Nº 1 restaurant in Madrid) and by the fact that Club Allard had just won their second Michelin star recently, and happily, my expectations were completely exceeded.  The atmosphere is elegant and refined, yet at the same time relaxed, probably by the very nice and warm treat of all the personnel. They made us feel like we were at some friend's house, which really makes a difference in such an exclusive place. And then the food... each plate was delicious and amazingly surprising with the mixture of flavours and textures. The chef managed to create a completely new feeling and taste on dishes, which after thinking it over, were probably inspired on rather classic tasteful treats. Like their best know dish which is basically a fried egg with bacon and toast!  The menu is closed to three options, which I would resume as: smaller, classic and novelty and that rank from 75 to 95 eur. We went for the novelty menu which included three starters, three main dishes and three desserts. Their wine list is extensive but mainly focus on Spanish wines. We spend the whole night talking about the dishes and the amazing feelings they produced on each of us. Arguing about what kind of ingredient we were looking or tasting and wondering how they managed to “transform” a mushroom into an algae or a “churro” into a coral. And then the final surprise was the last dessert: “The egg”. I won’t ruin the surprise of telling what it really was, but it was absolutely amazing. Attached I’m only including the pictures of the desserts: The “flowerpot”, the “fishbowl” and the “egg”.

Too often, high-end restaurants mean paying for overly expensive locales, paintings, etc. The Club Allard is nice enough, classical decor, etc, but you're here for the food, not to see a Rembrandt. And what a treat it was! The rascally-looking chef came out personally and spent a few minutes chit chatting and asking us about things we like. He even spoke to my dinner guests in English. He used that to come up with an 8-course meal that was outstanding. The textures, combinations, colors, variety were all well balanced. The portions made just right, to eat every bite and look forward to the next. OK, by course #6 we were getting really full, but there was no way I was going to stop! Some of the dishes were aesthetically sophisticated and beautifully served, and others were, well, delightful and made us guffaw and laugh and eating them was so much fun! You have to eat there to understand it, really. I've never had this kind of dining experience before. All three of us were so happy we had dinner there.

This is a mix of technical culinary skill, excellent staff and elegant location which sets the bar very, very high. Diego Guerrero is clearly a man of great culinary understanding, he is not a brash celebrity chef but comes across as a man who is genuinely interested in his art and strives for perfection. His dishes are challenging, interesting and totally enjoyable - he takes convention and ""toys"" with it, fooling the eye and tongue by creating things which looks conventional but are far from it. Despite this style the food is not aloof, pretentious or inaccessible; it is entertaining, fascinating and makes the diner question just how the creations arriving from the kitchen came to be. As a diner it is like being a child again being lead by Guerrero to discover new tastes and textures – the faces of the other diners in the restaurant are a theatre of expressions of surprise and delight as firstly the dishes arrive and secondly as they are consumed. This is no ordinary place by any measure. Having no menu is certainly an intriguing model; Guerrero comes to each table to introduce himself, to ask how many courses and to ask if there are any allergies or dislikes; from then on it is an illuminating process of being lead through a voyage of constant surprise, discovery and delight. This is not a self-indulgent process of molecular gastronomy collecting diverse tastes and textures for the sake of TV celebrity, these are accessible dishes created with absolute dexterity designed to please rather than to raise eyebrows. Clearly an experience such as this does not come cheap but neither should it – Guerrero has clearly invested time, money, passion and intellect into this restaurant but when you compare what it costs in Madrid to what it would cost in London then this is truly an absolute “must” for anyone who is interested and inspired by the work of a culinary artist such as Guerrero. It is not for everyone but it is for anyone who purports to enjoy an evening of culinary discovery.",2011-11-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or490-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_25822,0.031,0.729,0.24,0.9983,0.257773964131107,0.5566751185322611,0.3909399999999999,2135,184,0.0861826697892271,0,32,False,32,0.125,0.1583333333333333,0.35,0.075,0.1416666666666666,0.025,0.0333333333333333,0.0166666666666666,0.05,0.025,366,212,4.836065573770492,0,0,el club allard overwhelmingli excel experi everi part even innov excit inspir mix technic culinari skill excel staff eleg locat set bar high diego guerrero clearli man great culinari understand brash celebr chef come across man genuin interest art strive perfect dish challeng interest total enjoy take convent toy fool eye tongu creat thing look convent far despit style food aloof pretenti inaccess entertain fascin make diner question creation arriv kitchen came diner like child lead guerrero discov new tast textur face diner restaur theatr express surpris delight firstli dish arriv secondli consum ordinari place measur menu certainli intrigu model guerrero come tabl introduc ask mani cours ask allergi dislik illumin process lead voyag constant surpris discoveri delight self indulg process molecular gastronomi collect divers tast textur sake tv celebr access dish creat absolut dexter design pleas rather rais eyebrow clearli experi come cheap neither guerrero clearli invest time money passion intellect restaur compar cost madrid would cost london truli absolut must anyon interest inspir work culinari artist guerrero everyon anyon purport enjoy even culinari discoveri,very good review,5

You choose the number of courses you want and the chef decides what you get. However he consults with you personally beforehand for allergies and dislikes. We are fairly fussy but confined our dislikes to 3 areas and were quite lucky with the outcome. We loved everything from the friendly efficient service to the breads and linens and of course the food. There is an extensive and expensive wine list but we had a wondeful Spanish blend (mainly shiraz) for around €30. The food was varied, well presented and delicious. We went with the smallest number of courses (we are middled aged with small appetites!) and left feeling well satisfied without being overly full with lots of overly rich food. Our half portions of main fish and meat courses were adequate for us. I noticed that the chef seemed to spend most of his time in front of house which means he must have a gret team in the back!

He spoke to our table before and after the meal. We took one of the degustation menus that showcased his most popular servings. It was exceptional. Chef Guerrero moves towards molecular gastronomy but without Heston's theatre and supporting paraphanalia. This is all about the food rather than the journey. But there are still surprises and lots of cleverness. After two and a half weeks travelling through Spain and enjoying some good, bad and indifferent tapas we decided to finish our holiday at one of the best restauants and top end food Madrid could offer. This we achieved by dining at this restaurant. Highly recommended, and suggest if you are serious about food, don't leave Madrid without dining here. Also, interestingly, it is nowhere near as expensive as its equivalents in London. Although it is a little hard to find as it doesn't have a sign on the outside of the building. You have to walk into the foyer, up a few stairs and find the door on the right, opposite the lift.

It was probably early by the local standard (6:30ish), and the place was still empty. Our waiter, Alex, turned out to have spent some time in our home state NJ so we all had a nice chat. We ordered the recommended dishes (with asterisks next to them): garlic shrimps, flank steak, grilled squids, Spanish tortilla, patatas brava, and a creamy tomato soup. Not too crazy about the patatas brava, would have preferred fried potatoes rather than boiled, or the white sangria (a bit sweet for my taste, but my daughter liked it.) Other than that, the soup was very good and all other dishes were excellent, especially the steak and garlic shrimps. The red wine was pretty decent too. The price of our dinner was surprisingly cheap. This place is definitely worth a visit if you are in Madrid: good foods, very friendly services and quite cheap.",2016-04-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2140-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_8930,0.007,0.78,0.212,0.99,0.1790773809523809,0.4594047619047618,0.33675,930,69,0.0741935483870967,0,33,False,38,0.1666666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.2916666666666667,0.0833333333333333,0.1458333333333333,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.0208333333333333,0.0833333333333333,0.0208333333333333,163,128,4.711656441717792,0,0,visit el sur last friday arriv madrid morocco hour earlier probabl earli local standard ish place still empti waiter alex turn spent time home state nj nice chat order recommend dish asterisk next garlic shrimp flank steak grill squid spanish tortilla patata brava creami tomato soup crazi patata brava would prefer fri potato rather boil white sangria bit sweet tast daughter like soup good dish excel especi steak garlic shrimp red wine pretti decent price dinner surprisingli cheap place definit worth visit madrid good food friendli servic quit cheap,good review,4

The place was quite busy, so we needed to wait at the bar for a while until a table was free. This ended up being the best part of the evening. We enjoyed a few drinks while we watched the waitress / hostess keep things moving smoothly. The two bartenders were struggling and she was able to pick up the slack and keep the customers happy. She seemed equally fluent in both English and Spanish, so that helped quite a bit.  When we got our table we ordered most of the recommended items on the menu.

Situated in a corner historic building you pass through the lobby with security guard and are escorted to your table. The restaurant consists of several rooms with high ceilings and simple decor.

Interesting courses well described with three small appetizers, ""Sea Rice"" - actually squid made to look like rice and very clever, duck, fish, beef and three desserts. An extremely high level of workmanship prevailed all through the menu which was nicely balanced. Staff were all very friendly and mostly spoke good English and the sommelier was highly interactive when she found out we were in the wine trade.

This was the culinary highlight!

The dishes are creative, wholesome, yet familiar, and presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner, with some dishes like a piece of art on a plate. Though we had trouble finding the entrance, as there is no sign outside the building or on the wrought iron gates, once inside it is elegant, peaceful and calm. There are two tasting menus. We had the 12 course tasting menu which I was a little bit ambiguous about thinking my palate would get very muddied, however, I have to say that at the end of the meal, I was totally sated though I did not feel like a total gourmand. Nothing was overpowering. Everything was perfection. The dishes are too many to go into detail, though one of my favourites was the Shot of Butter Fish and White Asparagus foam (looked like a miniature beer) served in a shot glass accompanied with a seaweed toast with fish and oil roe. Another standout for me was the Quail Egg and Truffle Cupcake, to be eaten in one mouthful as once you bite into the cupcake the quail egg overflows into your mouth. The Hibiscus Flower and Pisco Sour pre-dessert bite was another artful presentation with the candied hibiscus flower sitting on a bed of pistachio cookie crumbs topped with a pisco sour foam, a great entrance to the dessert dishes.  El club Allard certainly warrants it’s two Michelin stars. The restaurant is not overly pretentious, with the wait staff being attentive, efficient, and genuine, and all had a good understanding of English. It is an expensive restaurant (115 to 145euro) but worth every penny for your palate to be aroused. I am filled with inspiration to be more artful when I entertain at home, though the sumptuousness of tonight's food cannot be replicated.",2017-03-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or60-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_19206,0.015,0.884,0.101,0.9741,0.1833994708994709,0.5119047619047619,0.3815538461538461,1845,148,0.0802168021680216,0,38,False,55,0.0975609756097561,0.1341463414634146,0.2926829268292683,0.0853658536585365,0.1585365853658536,0.024390243902439,0.024390243902439,0.0365853658536585,0.1219512195121951,0.024390243902439,323,208,4.712074303405573,0,0,el club allard one restaur cherish everi bite palat tantalis depth flavour textur dish creativ wholesom yet familiar present aesthet pleas manner dish like piec art plate though troubl find entranc sign outsid build wrought iron gate insid eleg peac calm two tast menu cours tast menu littl bit ambigu think palat would get muddi howev say end meal total sate though feel like total gourmand noth overpow everyth perfect dish mani go detail though one favourit shot butter fish white asparagu foam look like miniatur beer serv shot glass accompani seawe toast fish oil roe anoth standout quail egg truffl cupcak eaten one mouth bite cupcak quail egg overflow mouth hibiscu flower pisco sour pre dessert bite anoth art present candi hibiscu flower sit bed pistachio cooki crumb top pisco sour foam great entranc dessert dish el club allard certainli warrant two michelin star restaur overli pretenti wait staff attent effici genuin good understand english expens restaur euro worth everi penni palat arous fill inspir art entertain home though sumptuous tonight food cannot replic,very good review,5

Our tasting menu seemed endless, which was a good thing, because each course was so beautifully presented and delicious, even when we were full we did not want it to stop. This included perhaps the most helpful wine steward in Spain. He came to talk with us about foods and wines we liked and then made a selection for us that was wonderful (and we were pleased to find when the bill arrived was also a bargain). Our waiter was wonderful and attentive without being at all intrusive. We did manage to crack his professional demeanor when he asked how we like the incredibly complex and exquisite ell soup. ""It's exactly like my mother makes."" Even he had to chuckle at that. We've enjoyed meals at other 2-star Michelin restaurants, but this one is just perfect.

Really welcoming and very unpretentious (well as unpretentious as one can be in a Michelin Star Restaurant whilst being served 15 courses:)).........but really relaxed atmosphere. The chef, Diego Guerrero visits every table to discuss the dishes and take your order (Great touch and very personal, also came back at the end to ask our opinion of the food and to say goodbye). The food was fantastic, different influences from all continents but with a clean, well structured sabor theme throughout all the courses. Drama, Comedy, Complexity, Fun!! The food had everything and the ingredients were fresh as fresh can be, and very well matched.

On our arrival shortly after 9pm, we were told that as we'd didn't have a reservation, we'd have to be seated at the corner of a large table: no problem. The restaurant itself was not busy, only three or four tables were occupied, mainly by tourists and several of their reservations we later discovered turned out to be 'no shows.' Possibly a sign of what was to come. Somewhat bizarrely, the ambience was nil: most tables remained empty throughout our visit and by the time we left an hour or so later. Perhaps potential diners were driven away by the awful Kenny G-style covers of ballads including 'My Heart Will Go On', entirely at odds with the style of cuisine on offer. Our drinks order was taken fairly promptly by a friendly waiter: unfortunately the menu had been amended and Estrella was no longer available, it had been replaced by Stella Artois. Not an issue, as we were advised about a decent Spanish alternative, which we ordered. After ordering a spring roll starter, shrimp and papaya salad and green chicken curry, the waiter returned to apologise: the kitchen was out of green papaya, would mango do instead? No problem at all. Except that when the infamous salad did arrive, it consisted of a pile of shredded mango, a handful of chillies and precisely two small shrimps. Not the greatest value for €10.50 per plate. We politely queried this with the waitress who responded defensively and rudely by claiming that plating up is the kitchen's responsibility and 'it's not my fault I just work here' before walking away with no attempt to resolve the situation. At this stage, not a single bite had been eaten and we seriously considered paying for the beers and walking out, except for the sudden arrival of all the other dishes simultaneously; curry, rice and our starter of four small, flaccid spring rolls.  Fortunately the kinder waiter (and sole member of staff with an an ounce of customer service training, it seemed), came over to apologise and to ask if we wanted to replace the salad with another alternative. We did, and chose a chicken fried rice. This finally arrived towards the end of our meal after chasing, (and yet more rudeness from the worst waitress in Madrid). Having travelled extensively around Thailand, we can say that the food at Bambubox is, on the surface at least, authentic. The menu choices certainly reflect Thai dishes and ingredients, when the advertised ingredients are available. However, value for money here is poor: small portions and clearly scrimping when it comes to more expensive ingredients. Although the food tasted good, it was unforgettable and certainly captured little of the flair for delicious Thai cooking. Customer service at this establishment also leaves little to be desired. Avoid if you can, there are many other preferable choices for Asian cuisine in Madrid.

We had some spare time and decided to visit Madrid again. So, we did not make reservation at all. Fortunately, there was a table available for us.  Same as last time, Diego was still on his Crocs and came out to take the order by himself. We ordered the tasting menu. It costed EUR 74 and offered 2 snacks, 3 starters, 2 fish course, 1 meat course, 1 pre-dessert, 2 desert and Tea/Coffee + Petit Fours. The price is the same as 2 years ago.  The dishes were mainly on gastronomy styles. For example, it looks like a tomato but it is not a real tomato. It is tomato concentrate in membrane.  There was a disk offered Squid with fungus in Squid Ink. Very creative combination. The taste of fungus in octopus ink was incredebility good.  Another fish dish is also very good. I cannot remember the fish is hake or monk fish. The fish skin is very crunchy but the fish texture is smooth & fresh. It formed the contrast of texture. At the same time, I can feel the real fish taste itself not the seasoning. Compared to Arzak (we visited a few days before this one), it is much better. Arzak's fish was just like a chewing gum without fish taste itself but just the taste of seasoning.  The desert is the most fantastic part. The award winning fish bowl came first. It really looked like a real fish tank. Everything inside was eatable and delicious. The 2nd desert was an egg. After breaking the egg shell, it had egg white and egg yolk inside. The egg yolk was in liquid status. See photo. The taste was brilliant. We were very satisfactory with this dinner. The cost performance ratio is exceptionally remarkable. It is only a 1-starred restuarant. We think that it is far better than some 3-starred restuarants.",2011-10-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or490-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_25849,0.0,0.828,0.172,0.9971,0.3152020202020202,0.486010101010101,0.2087941176470588,1874,149,0.0795090715048025,0,57,False,78,0.1282051282051282,0.1025641025641025,0.2179487179487179,0.0769230769230769,0.141025641025641,0.0512820512820512,0.0897435897435897,0.0512820512820512,0.0769230769230769,0.0641025641025641,341,201,4.480938416422287,0,0,visit restaur year ago press creativ design chef diego guerrero origin plan visit madrid spare time decid visit madrid make reserv fortun tabl avail us last time diego still croc came take order order tast menu cost eur offer snack starter fish cours meat cours pre dessert desert tea coffe petit four price year ago dish mainli gastronomi style exampl look like tomato real tomato tomato concentr membran disk offer squid fungu squid ink creativ combin tast fungu octopu ink incredebl good anoth fish dish also good cannot rememb fish hake monk fish fish skin crunchi fish textur smooth fresh form contrast textur time feel real fish tast season compar arzak visit day one much better arzak fish like chew gum without fish tast tast season desert fantast part award win fish bowl came first realli look like real fish tank everyth insid eatabl delici nd desert egg break egg shell egg white egg yolk insid egg yolk liquid statu see photo tast brilliant satisfactori dinner cost perform ratio except remark star restuar think far better star restuar,very good review,5

Being his 30th birthday and organizing a trip to Europe to celebrate, I wanted to be certain that our dinner is going to be memorable and exquisite! El Club Allard did not disappoint! Making a booking was easy enough, I just had to send a couple of emails and that's it. I mentioned in my reservation that it was for a 30th and they did a little something special with the dessert for my boyfriend which was a nice touch. From the moment we walked into the restaurant it just felt lovely. Everyone was really nice and the attention to details and the way they make one feel was amazing. We didn't opt for the pairing of wines with our selection but we did opt for the Gastronomic degustation menu and it was amazing. Head chef, Diego Guerrero came out and greeted us and asked whether we have any dietary requirements moments after we got there. The sommelier was great as well. He offered two great wines for us to go with our dinner and they were fantastic. Overall, the food was amazing. Each dish that comes out gets better and better. It was beautiful to look at, almost like a master piece and best of all, the taste was amazing. It was both visually appealing and tantalizing to the taste bud. It was actually sad when our last dish arrived! Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Madrid. The price was excellent and valued for money for what they served there and it is definitely a great experience to dine at this beautiful restaurant. The ambiance was great and the service was very professional and just right. I don't know whether it's because they knew we were celebrating a special occasion and that we were visiting Madrid, we were given a pair of beautifully and nicely printed menu with the date of our dinner to take home with us. It was a lovely touch and a great way to end our dining experience at El Club Allard! I can't wait to be back there with my boyfriend again! It is definitely one of the best place in the world!",2011-10-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or490-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_25851,0.008,0.687,0.304,0.9994,0.4714314058956917,0.6516666666666667,0.3624318181818182,2089,196,0.0938247965533748,6,38,False,86,0.125,0.2083333333333333,0.3194444444444444,0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,0.0277777777777777,0.0138888888888888,0.0,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,382,203,4.471204188481676,0,0,much research onlin decid book el club allard celebr boyfriend th birthday madrid th birthday organ trip europ celebr want certain dinner go memor exquisit el club allard disappoint make book easi enough send coupl email mention reserv th littl someth special dessert boyfriend nice touch moment walk restaur felt love everyon realli nice attent detail way make one feel amaz opt pair wine select opt gastronom degust menu amaz head chef diego guerrero came greet us ask whether dietari requir moment got sommeli great well offer two great wine us go dinner fantast overal food amaz dish come get better better beauti look almost like master piec best tast amaz visual appeal tantal tast bud actual sad last dish arriv overal would highli recommend restaur anyon visit madrid price excel valu money serv definit great experi dine beauti restaur ambianc great servic profession right know whether knew celebr special occas visit madrid given pair beauti nice print menu date dinner take home us love touch great way end dine experi el club allard wait back boyfriend definit one best place world,very good review,5

We walked into this beautiful building; it's true what the other reviews say that there is no sign in front indicating the Restaurant name. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left they treated us like royalty. Now the food. Inventive, creative, tasty goodness. We both loved every course and the waiter(s) explained everything in Spanglish. Also, it says a lot about the integrity of a waiter when you ask for a Wine recommendation and he recommends something mid price range. The Wine? So smooth and paired well with every dish. I have to talk about the dessert because I am not a dessert guy. I don't really have a sweet tooth but I had to dive into the aquarium they put in front of me just out of curiosity. The different textures and not overly sweet. The kicker was the special plate they brought out for my Wife's Birthday. For the experience we had the bill was not that bad. I've paid much more for less.

Also, and modesty aside, I have been fortunate to have eaten at numerous Michelin starred restaurants (Fat Duck, PerSe, French Laundry, Waterside Inn, La Gavroche, Bagatelle, Moulin de Mougins.. and many more) and to be honest felt that I was finished with 'testing menus', etc. I booked because my daughter has turned into a ""foodie' (specially when Mom pays!) and wanted to try it. I don't want to get carried away with superlatives but truly: we LOVED this meal! We had the 10-course menu and they were all fabulous. Not a weak one in the bunch! The service was exceptional .. flawless. We wanted to try Spanish wines and were expertly advised! When I thought the evening could not get any better, the Chef Maria Marte came to our table. As impressed as I had been with the meal, I was floored with Ms. Marte - not only is she a world class chef, she is a unique and inspiring human being. Her story - starting as a dish washer at the restaurant to being awarded two Michelin stars brought tears of joy and pride! I considered my evening at El Club Allard among my most memorable ones!

One-third of the courses were outstanding, including the 1st two & one of the main courses, which was pork. The rest were average, & one course, which was the featured ""cupcake"" was a disaster. The crust was way too thick, which adversely affected the overall taste. Service was extremely cool, to the extent of having an attitude. That started when I declined the offer to have my coat hanged. I have not brought my handbag, and my pockets were filled with varies stuff. I'd really preferred to keep it at the back of my chair. Then, my husband had the 4-glass wine-pairing. The Sommelier said wine-pairing was tailored according to individual preference. My husband specifically said he did not want dessert wine. She acknowledged and said she'd bring white, red, & maybe some sparkling wine. We had no idea she did not understand. When she brought the 4th glass, which was dessert wine, of course my husband declined. At the end of the dinner, we're charged for all 4 glasses for €40.

This impression was shared by everybody at my table of Le Club Allard (nothing french here, the owner of the building took off the G and o of the original Gallardo to make it sounds french). There are 3 set menus at 74, 84 and 94 euros. The more you pay, more food you have. We decided for the 84 which was enough. We also tooke the sommelier’s recommandation of having 4 different wines with the food, 2 whites, 2 reds. Anywhere else in the world in that kind of restaurant you would end up in paying a hefty price for the wine. Here, the very kind and knowledgeable somelier, make us discover unknown and exceptional local varietals at a surprinsingly 5 euros a glass.    We were served throughout the diner may be 12 dishes, very creative. Mind and palate were equally spoiled.   Negative note, the lighting make the place a bit depressing.

We ordered a plate of french fries with eggs (I think they are called patatas revueltos or something like that) and they were fantastic. I ordered the monk fish (rape) and it was prepared simply and was very delicious. At my table someone had gambas al ajillo and someone else had the entrecôte - both incredible as well.

We went for lunch and there were just a few other people. The environment was great since we enjoyed talking and not having to be disturbed all the time.

We came and explained what happened and the lady at the front said sorry it's too late, we're busy. We asked if they could at least try considering we came all the way and had hungry kids, the manager came told another waiter to tell us they were busy. We saw a table empty and asked why we couldn't sit there, they said "" we'll give you two options, either you order take away or you leave, we are busy and don't have time for this"".  Lazy, rude and careless for a hungry family who drove all the way with a booking. Shocking, horrible, and disgusting. Be warned and do not visit this in humane establishment.

We were not disappointed! The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and inviting. From the moment we walked in, Miguel, Frank, and Rebeca were incredibly welcoming and friendly. My sister is a vegetarian and they were very accommodating about answering all our questions about the menu.

The decor is along the lines of more traditional fine dining. Large spacious dining room with white table clothes and plenty of space between guests. When we arrived it was quite empty so the space seemed a bit sterile, but as the dining room filled up the ambience was much better. The wait staff was excellent. They always made sure our glasses were full and were very knowledgable about the wines and menu. All of the dishes were creative and delicious. I will say that the ones that stood out were the foie gras and truffle starter, the Turbot main and the desserts. The courses were well paced and the chef even came out to the dining room a couple times during our meal to see how his guests were doing. I think this says a lot about the chef and the restaurant in going above and beyond to make sure that the guests are well taken care of - it also gave us a chance to tell him how excellent his food was!

We also appreciated that when we asked them to choose a bottle of cava for us, they didn't choose the most expensive bottle. I was a bit worried but I'm not a wine expert so I couldn't choose from their extensive menu. The Chef came out to meet us himself before and after the meal. He was very personable too.

We had lunch and every single dish was perfect. It is very unusual in such a long tasting menu not to have a single wrong note but it was all exquisite. So often, Michelin starred meals trade taste for inventiveness or shock value but the tastes here were perfectly balanced. What was most impressive, however, was the value for money. Wines were very reasonably priced and the sommelier made suggestions which were delicious but well priced. Nice touch of the chef to both welcome us and say goodbye before we left.

It is located in the corner of a very grand apartment block, there is a doorman though so you can find it ok. Inside the decoration is plain, simple but extremely classy, very understated. The service is perfect (which is something you can often easily fault) but there were no faults. The food, there are 3 tasting menus to choose from - simply depends on how many courses you would like. For the amount of food you get the price is amazing value. You do not get a choice of the food, you simply get to taste every delight they offer you. We had 11 courses, every single course was fantastic. Mind blowing tastes with wonderful 'art' presentation. There are some very reasonable priced bottles of wine on the menu (something you don't often get in fine dining restaurants in the UK).

WOW. and WOW. our hotel recommended Club Allard for our 2nd night in Madrid, and we took that recommendation on face value without doing any further due diligence. after a little difficulty in finding the restaurant (since it is on the 2nd floor of what appears to be a grand apartment building on the corner of Plaza Espana), we were surprised to find that there was no a la carte, only tasting menus, something the hotel had not forewarned us about. feeling very badly, we offered to give up our table, because we didn't think we could eat the 9 courses on the smallest menu......the chef came out and very graciously offered instead to do a condensed menu instead, which we accepted. after the first few courses, in conversation with our very good server, we commented on how delicious everything was and how beautifully each course was prepared and presented. she responded by saying it was too bad we weren't doing the entire menu. now realizing how small each course was we lamented that we couldn't do the full menu and she offered to ask the chef if we could. the chef, once again, very graciously accommodated us! needless to say, all remaining courses were unbelievable! we travel extensively and this is one of the best restaurants, maybe even the best, that we've ever eaten at. obviously an expensive splurge, but well worth every eurocent!  thanks you Diego for your graciousness and your delicious food! and thank you too for your wonderful servers!",2012-04-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or470-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26002,0.031,0.751,0.218,0.9942,0.1696969696969697,0.6100000000000001,0.3886071428571429,1469,128,0.0871341048332198,5,42,False,51,0.074074074074074,0.1111111111111111,0.2592592592592592,0.074074074074074,0.1111111111111111,0.0555555555555555,0.037037037037037,0.074074074074074,0.1296296296296296,0.074074074074074,254,166,4.783464566929134,0,0,wow wow wow hotel recommend club allard nd night madrid took recommend face valu without due dilig littl difficulti find restaur sinc nd floor appear grand apart build corner plaza espana surpris find la cart tast menu someth hotel forewarn us feel badli offer give tabl think could eat cours smallest menu chef came gracious offer instead condens menu instead accept first cours convers good server comment delici everyth beauti cours prepar present respond say bad entir menu realiz small cours lament full menu offer ask chef could chef gracious accommod us needless say remain cours unbeliev travel extens one best restaur mayb even best ever eaten obvious expens splurg well worth everi euroc thank diego gracious delici food thank wonder server,very good review,5

We knew we wanted to have one dinner that would be an exceptional experience, so I did some research about outstanding restaurants in Madrid. I am so glad that we chose El Club Allard. If you read the other reviews on TripAdvisor, you'll see that the food is sublime. What's clear is that the chef - Diego Guerrero - displays a real sense of humor in his presentation of the various courses. For example, one of our courses was a piece of camembert prepared to look like a small Babybel cheese. I could site other great examples, but don't want to ruin the experience for future diners! The service was also excellent, save for a slight mix-up at the beginning around which wait person would be serving us some additional wine. The wine suggestions made by the sommelier were excellent - a beautiful bottle of white which we drank with most of the courses, and then a gorgeous glass of red to accompany our meat course. Our only disappointment - and this is very minor and really an issue on our part - was that we often had difficulty understanding what the wait staff was saying as they described the ingredients of each course. They did speak English, which we appreciated greatly, but we missed some of the more unusual ingredients in each dish. At the end of our meal, the gentleman who took our order when we were first seated came to ask us how we enjoyed ourselves. Of course, we gushed about how we loved everything about the night and we asked that he express our gratitude to the chef. Weren't we so pleasantly surprised when he responded ""I am the chef, so thank you!"" We all laughed, shook hands, and my husband and I walked away as big fans of Diego Guerrero and El Club Allard.

The environs are formal, spare, and spotless. Of all the places in which we dined during our Madrid stay, El Club Allard felt the most like a dining spot for businessmen. The female chef in charge runs a very tight ship indeed. From the start, the gentleman serving us seemed to have a one-upmanship approach that rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe it was because we were American, or maybe it was just his persona, but that issue was settled after the third course. Even though El Club Allard had a stiff air to it, the food certainly met the rigorous standards one would expect of a dining destination of this caliber. The wine list is excellent, broad, and offers good value. At El Club Allard, you won’t find unusual experimentation, but you can rest assured, the dishes will reflect assiduous standards of preparation.

I have subsequently written to the restaurant to ask whether they could arrange a little happy birthday greeting for my husband while serving deserts (inspired by the photos of previous visitors) and the reply was positive.  We arrived slightly before the booked time and were seated at the best table, overlooking the whole dining area. The 14-course menu presented a variety of food, and although I am a picky eater, I ate 12. Furthermore, when the staff saw that I was stalling with two courses, they immediately offered replacement. The freshly baked gluten-free bread was served to me at the start,while the offer of wheat-breads was diverse. This was the best gluten-free bread I ever tasted.  The recommendation for the wine was excellent and the chosen bottle wasn't pricey (compared to its shop value). At the time of the dessert, a big tray with small cakes and inscription in Swedish (using white chocolate) arrived, with a candle at the side, with recommendation it should be blown. Needless to say, my husband was speechless, while I almost cried from happiness.  After the meal, we were offered to see the kitchen, through a window partition and had opportunity to witness the head chef at work. We also received a parchment which had all courses printed in English.

El Club Allard is in this category. There is also a personal touch, as the chef Diego Guerrero visited the table at the start to discuss allergies and preferences but also at the end and said goodbye as we left. There were three choices of tasting menu: Snacks (2 or 3 or 4), Appetizer (2 or 3 or 4) followed in each case by Fish, Meat, Pre-dessert and 2 Desserts. We went for the middle option but other tables which went for the shorter menu had different courses. We started with an amuse-bouche of candied salmon and caviar. All the snacks and appetizers were excellent, but the highlights for me were he Game truffle with Foie gras and the tasty Butterfish. The meat ""Wagyu Picanha"" was the best beef that I have had outside the USA. The pre-dessert and desserts all displayed great visual imagination - take a look at the ""FIshbowl"" and ""Poached egg"" desserts on the website! 11 courses plus amuse and petit fours sound a lot, but the portions are sized well and I felt replete (but not over-full) at the end.

Staff there definitely get a 15 out of 10 as they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Also, their English is great so have no worries if you're not great in Spanish. We got the half portion of chiporines a la plancha (grilled squid) with a side salad which was €5.50 (if I remember correctly), the Musaka (lasagna-like dish with eggplant) which was around €3 or 4 and it was great!

This having been said, that isn't really an excuse for the restaurant as we are paying a lot of money for this experience. We went with some friends who were visiting and they mostly shared our opinion. We got the 12 course menu and the food was very tasty, as was the wine selection. The only part that let me down was the desert. Overall the dining time was around 2-2:30 hours. While it was definitely a pleasant experience, unlike some other much more disappointing michelin star dinners I have had, I don't believe it was up to the standard of a 2 star michelin restaurant, and possibly not the price we payed either. The service was very good, although they weren't extremely accommodating with my sister who is a picky eater except for when the food had nuts that she's allergic to. I'm not dying to go back, though I might consider it to see if this was a one-time thing or if the restaurant has actually lost the 'wow' factor.",2016-08-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or80-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26033,0.06,0.83,0.109,0.9375,0.1429468599033816,0.5272705314009661,0.3806,1252,122,0.097444089456869,0,30,False,47,0.1388888888888889,0.1388888888888889,0.1805555555555555,0.0833333333333333,0.1388888888888889,0.0416666666666666,0.0277777777777777,0.0694444444444444,0.0972222222222222,0.0833333333333333,228,149,4.495614035087719,0,0,went graduat parent gone absolut blown away realli expect someth amaz fair give restaur benefit doubt arriv extrem late graduat ceremoni drag forev probabl last one seat said realli excus restaur pay lot money experi went friend visit mostli share opinion got cours menu food tasti wine select part let desert overal dine time around hour definit pleasant experi unlik much disappoint michelin star dinner believ standard star michelin restaur possibl price pay either servic good although extrem accommod sister picki eater except food nut allerg die go back though might consid see one time thing restaur actual lost wow factor,average review,3

They do not accept reservations, so you have to be therewell in advance and join a list. There is only room for 20 guests, so nights are very busy. Once you are in, you are served what they propose. Food is a Spanish-Asian fusion, where dishes are not over 8/9€. Is a kind of tapas but with very elaborated fare. They also offer wine pairings, in case you wanted. Do not bring seniors, as ambiance is quite hipster, with loud music and tattooed waiters. Service is great, at least when I went; we were only 11 guests out of the maximum 20.

I dined here for dinner, and in this review, I will provide my insights.  Typically, customers must wait outside before 8:00PM, on the conservative side, in order to guarantee a spot on the list at 8:30PM. They only let in the first 20 people. Once customers are on the list, they are free to leave and should be back at 9:00PM to grab their reserved seat.  Upon sitting down, I was greeted by name. The staff was very warm and made me feel welcomed. I encourage all customers dining here to be open-minded. There is no concrete menu. The team changes up what they prepare each night, and they ask which dishes you would like. Even with the language barrier, they communicated very well which ingredients are in all of their dishes. The gentleman sitting next to me was also very helpful. After placing my order, I watched the staff perform as a team. Everyone displayed pure talent. It was as if I was sitting in the front row witnessing a culinary show. While they were always busy, they remained calm and enthusiastic.  Dishes started coming out in repetition. The team members were very knowledgeable on which drinks complemented which dishes best. I took their advice, and I am glad I did. During my meal, I consumed ingredients which appeared exotic, yet every bite was completely euphoric. If you are adventurous with your food, or want to be, you must dine here. For many international people, trying things such as, pig ear or squid ink-infused double-fermented dough may seem too exotic. However, I encourage you to broaden your comfort zone and be optimistic. If something is too far-fetched for you, skip it. Everything about this place speaks talent. Trust the talent, and like me, you will be extremely pleased with your experience. While this restaurant is pricy, especially if you order multiple dishes and multiple drinks, I will certainly be back on special occasions with other open-minded eaters. If this review is at all helpful, please like it to increase its exposure.

The atmosphere is great, with dark lights, cool music ( not too loud) and very friendly staff. You can seat at the bar or in one of the two tables they have. The cooks and waiters are behind the bar preparing everything and talking to customers As they told me i said to them to start bringin plates until i couldnt continue. And what an experience. Each dumplimg or piece of sushi was full of taste. So much that almost made me cry ! Like this we went through several rounds of delicious staff i cant describe. When i was almost full i asked what else they had and the cook said ... A bacon samdwich ! What? Well it was awesome, a thick slice of bacon cooked with i domt know what for about 5 days !!!!! Delicious Then they offered some nice desserts as well. We did a maridage of wines with the food, it was good but inwould not repeat it. We drunk a lot, it was expensive and not what i would have chosen. But the guys were really flexible, when something we didnt like they always tried to find aomething else for us.

Dolores y Lola was a wonderful surprise. This was the best meal we had in Spain, and we've had a number of excellent meals. The food is fresh and seasonal. The strawberry salad mentioned in other reviews was missing from the menu, replaced by a salad with chicken, mango, papaya and a lovely citrus infused oil dressing. The three of us shared the salad, chorizio, eggplant, meatballs, deserts and 2 rounds of sangria. Every dish was a delight on the tastebuds. The presentation of the food was simple and beautiful. I kept comparing the flavors to our visit to the Inn at Little Washington and Komi (places we visited with foodie friends, once each). The flavors were on par without, minus all the formalities For around $80€. The venue is small, tucked away and quiet. When we arrived at 8:45, the place was empty. It got busy after 9:00. We were the only tourists. It was fun watching two individuals who run the place, a female chef in the back and an all around conductor in the front.  The sangria was different, and the best we've had anywhere. The pitcher includes one full glass of wine, fresh fruit, and about 5 or six additional ingredients that we couldn't capture, maybe brandy, vodka, etc. Be careful, we finished two pitchers over 2 1/2 hour, I don't have a hangover, waiting for the others to wake up and see if they survived. I don't typically provide reviews, however, this place was special and deserves a call out. If we visit Madrid in the future, we'll return to this gem.",2018-07-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d9593554-Reviews-Dolores_y_Lola-Madrid.html,UID_26053,0.012,0.832,0.156,0.9931,0.180275041050903,0.4825944170771757,0.22915,1648,134,0.0813106796116504,0,60,False,63,0.0566037735849056,0.2075471698113207,0.3584905660377358,0.0754716981132075,0.1132075471698113,0.0,0.0,0.0566037735849056,0.0754716981132075,0.0566037735849056,296,194,4.5641891891891895,0,0,wrape two week visit spain last night return malasana week nerja use trip advisor find restaur nearbi dolor lola wonder surpris best meal spain number excel meal food fresh season strawberri salad mention review miss menu replac salad chicken mango papaya love citru infus oil dress three us share salad chorizio eggplant meatbal desert round sangria everi dish delight tastebud present food simpl beauti kept compar flavor visit inn littl washington komi place visit foodi friend flavor par without minu formal around venu small tuck away quiet arriv place empti got busi tourist fun watch two individu run place femal chef back around conductor front sangria differ best anywher pitcher includ one full glass wine fresh fruit six addit ingredi captur mayb brandi vodka etc care finish two pitcher hour hangov wait other wake see surviv typic provid review howev place special deserv call visit madrid futur return gem,good review,4

It is not possible to reserve, you need to queue outside and half an hour before they open they will give you a table. It's definitely worth the inconvenience. There are nigiris on the menu, some more traditional, some riskier, like the Iberian pork bacon one. All are delicious. The rest follows the same trend: a mix of Asian and Mediterranean (the Madrilenian calamari sandwich on chinese bread - fantastic, Thai curry with frog legs, oxtail dumplings, etc). We ended with two finger-licking deserts: a Japanese version of the traditional Spanish cheese-and-quince and roaste pinapple sautéed with black butter. Impeccable. Price is more than correct for the high quality of the menu, with a fast and polite service. If I had to name something that could improve it would be the loud music (just another of the many similarities with StreetXO) Highly recommended.

As we walked through the Plaza de Mayor and the Mercado de San Miguel, it took all our efforts not to devour every little snack that we saw there in order to be hungry enough to enjoy El Sur. The restaurant is in a narrow and somewhat hidden alley so it is definitely a ""destination"". It's small, a bar counter and a few tables visited mostly by locals. We found a table in the back almost immediately and over ordered as I always do, living up to my mantra of ""The unexamined life is not worth living"". We had the Patatas Bravas, Musaka, grilled Pulpo(octopus) and a shrimp risotto type dish paired with some Vermouth and Sangria. The food was very tasty and using extremely fresh ingredients.

We both had the 12 course menu, and I am a vegetarian. This was no problem at all for the restaurant and I can honestly say this was the best 12 courses I have ever had as vegetarian across all the michelin restaurants I have eaten in. Each course was magnificently presented and some of the tastes that were created were exceptional. One of our favourites being the cup-cake course. The wine we ordered was excellent as well. This was by far the best meal we had in Madrid, and if we ever travelled back we would definately visit again.
