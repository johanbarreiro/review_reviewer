I'm not someone who writes a lot of reviews but felt compelled after our experience. When making reservations you have the option of going to the 8:00 show with dinner or the midnight show and have drinks. We chose the dinner show because midnight was a little too late for us. After being seated, we took a look at the dinner menu. I expected the prices to be a little outrageous since it's basically a dinner theatre and a huge tourist attraction, but that didn't even prepare me for the sticker shock I felt. Hoping that the food was going to be wonderful (which I should have known better) we enjoyed a bottle of wine and waited for our food. When it arrived, my wife's lobster was barely cooked and sent it back, my food was OK at best. It's pretty sad when you spend 138 Euros on dinner (not including the tickets to the show) and all your thinking about is where is the closest McDonalds when the show is over. The service was poor, no one checked in on us to see if the 2nd attempt on the lobster was satisfactory. Right when I was trying my hardest to stay optimistic, hoping that the show would make me forget about the bad food, a bunch of people started flowing in at the last minute to fill up all of the seats. None of these people ordered food and basically got in to see the early show without spending nearly the same amount of money as us. The dancing was great, and very entertaining, but overall the show didn't make up for the short-comings.",2009-11-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or400-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17156,0.072,0.759,0.169,0.9891,0.1022486772486772,0.4970634920634921,0.3461499999999999,1523,147,0.0965200262639527,0,34,False,58,0.0909090909090909,0.1363636363636363,0.2727272727272727,0.0606060606060606,0.2575757575757575,0.0454545454545454,0.0151515151515151,0.0303030303030303,0.0606060606060606,0.0303030303030303,288,173,4.291666666666667,0,0,wife went corral de la morreria last night someon write lot review felt compel experi make reserv option go show dinner midnight show drink chose dinner show midnight littl late us seat took look dinner menu expect price littl outrag sinc basic dinner theatr huge tourist attract even prepar sticker shock felt hope food go wonder known better enjoy bottl wine wait food arriv wife lobster bare cook sent back food ok best pretti sad spend euro dinner includ ticket show think closest mcdonald show servic poor one check us see nd attempt lobster satisfactori right tri hardest stay optimist hope show would make forget bad food bunch peopl start flow last minut fill seat none peopl order food basic got see earli show without spend nearli amount money us danc great entertain overal show make short come,bad review,2

I happened to go to El Corral de la Moreria and I highly recommend it! It is the oldest and most famous tablao in Madrid and it is well known among celebrates and royalty, such as Natalie Portman, Frank Sinatra, the King and Queen of Spain, Ernest Hemingway and many more. And the flamenco was amazing! The entire audience was enraptured from the first notes of the spanish guitar to the final stomp of the flamenco dancer´s heel. Before the show started, my friend and I ate an amazing dinner! I had roasted vegetables, leg of lamb and sorbet.

As we were going to meet up with some friends later, we made reservations for the early show, planning to have dinner there as well. BIG MISTAKE. The place is a cattle car when it comes to packing people in. Every single nook and cranny is jammed with a table. We ordered our dinner - each of us had the paella figuring it was a specialty of the house and how could you go wrong with paella. Wow, again, big mistake. The food was bland and uninspired. The service was almost non-existent.  I will say that the show was amazing. The costumes, intensity, and electricity of the dancers could be felt throughout the place (not hard I guess when you are packed in). Would we do it again? Not for dinner. Maybe just to see the show.

We made our reservation online at 2pm on the same day and were very happy that we could book a table for 9:15pm (We recently found out Spanish people eat at late times!) We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted by Delfina. She and the rest of the staff were super friendly and give us helpful food recommendations. We ordered the Patatas Bravas, Seabass Ceviche and freshly made Tortilla. If you like blue cheese, my girlfriend said that the Cabrales blue cheese with red pepper honey montaditos is the best blue cheese she has ever tasted. The food was very affordable, portion sizes were just right for sharing and the warm service from the staff made our dinner experience very enjoyable. Thank you to the chef and lovely staff.

Its clear from our visit that both these are either untrue or ignorant claims. Firstly the meat - this is a well run kitchen with good chefs - the meat is excellent and its cooked to chefs liking - usually rare. I would've thought that was a given these days but we personally witnessed a group of dutch people send all their meat back to be, in their own words, deep cooked. So if you're ignorant and like expensive cuts of meat to be completely overcooked then fine but don't claim its a problem of the restaurant,  Secondly re the dark - well it true the place is a little crammed and you will eat partially in the dark - but its dinner and a show. So some sacrifices have to made - we cant expect them to leave all the lights on. Now the food - wow. The pigeon, lamb and beef were all superb. Cooked perfectly and great dishes with interesting sides and sauces - kind of french neo classical cooking. The Iberico starter that we shared was also top notch.

And the place is quite hard to find. ,2018-03-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or70-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_11115,0.018,0.869,0.114,0.8836,0.0383333333333333,0.6416666666666667,0.3678599999999999,431,48,0.111368909512761,0,6,False,23,0.1052631578947368,0.1578947368421052,0.3157894736842105,0.0,0.2631578947368421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578947368421052,0.0,88,63,3.897727272727273,0,0,cours dinner wine watch show food amaz show outstand waiter giovanni friendli even gave us bottl wine take back us issu let go insid even minut earlier even cold rain offer umbrella wait rain place quit hard find,good review,4

The menu's are mainly fixed price although there is a a al carte menu . We had a fixed price memu with wine and it cost just over 50 Euros each. The food was very good and well presented and the service was effecient as well as attentive.  The show costs about 40 Euros on top of the meal so for two the cost is about 180 Euros for show and meal. The club is quite small and low roofed and the tables are quite close together but this adds to the atmosphere. The stage is a raised area in one corner and was easily viewable although there was a couple of supporting colums that may have got in the way for sme tables. The show itself lasted about an hour and a half and we felt was absolutly fantastc. It was dramatic, passonate and the dancers had fabulous technical skills. The level of noise from the guitars, singers and dancers shoes was amazing and made the whole experience the highlight of our trip. Well worth going to and highly recomended.",2010-09-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or390-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17186,0.007,0.855,0.138,0.9816,0.1946296296296296,0.4538888888888889,0.3811818181818181,1086,102,0.0939226519337016,0,16,False,43,0.0714285714285714,0.0714285714285714,0.25,0.0714285714285714,0.4642857142857143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714285714285714,0.0,208,130,4.221153846153846,0,0,went show friday rd septemb arriv finish meal pm show start menu mainli fix price although al cart menu fix price memu wine cost euro food good well present servic effeci well attent show cost euro top meal two cost euro show meal club quit small low roof tabl quit close togeth add atmospher stage rais area one corner easili viewabl although coupl support colum may got way sme tabl show last hour half felt absolutli fantastc dramat passon dancer fabul technic skill level nois guitar singer dancer shoe amaz made whole experi highlight trip well worth go highli recomend,good review,4

The flamenco was superb and saved the evening I was fortunate to see Blanca del Rey who was truly amazing and I would highly recommend people to actively seek out her performances, without hesitation. However the main drawback was the food. The first course vegetable Mille Feuille was superb. However for the main course I chose the chicken with a whisper of paella. When I cut into the middle of the chicken it was bright pink and uncooked. As I did not wish salmonella as a souvenir of my visit I had to send it back to the kitchen to be recooked. After I had done this I had to wait a very long time for the main course to be replaced. It would also have been nice to have received an apology from the restaurant that this took place but unfortunately no apologies were forthcoming. Also when the main course was replaced they did not replace the paella accompaniment to the meal. The dessert, rice pudding, was OK but not great. When you are paying a minimum of 43 Euros for the mal the least you could expect is that you are not going to contract food poisoning! The seating arrangements also left something to be desired. Initially I was seated facing a brick wall and with severely restricted sight of the stage. When I complained there seemed to be little to no attempt to reseat me until I insisted that I would leave and that they should reimburse the money that I had paid to see the show. When I started to put on my coat to go they eventually moved me to a position from which I could see the stage. The payment of the bill was fine although they made me wait until the end. To add insult to injury the waitress asked me to add a tip to the bill as ""service was not included"". It was at this stage that I had to explain to her that I could not possibly tip her as the food was sub-standard, reminded her that I had to send the chicken back to the kitchen and told her that I was fortunate not to have contracted salmonella. So if you want to see superb flamenco (and it was) this venue is excellent. However please be sure to check your food before you eat it as this review comes with a health warning.",2010-05-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or390-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17190,0.092,0.789,0.12,0.7775,0.1816025641025641,0.5657834757834757,0.5573199999999999,2212,231,0.1044303797468354,1,30,False,67,0.1011235955056179,0.0898876404494382,0.3033707865168539,0.0449438202247191,0.1348314606741573,0.0449438202247191,0.0337078651685393,0.0786516853932584,0.1235955056179775,0.0449438202247191,421,215,4.2565320665083135,0,0,recent corral de la moreria decid worthwhil write honest review flamenco superb save even fortun see blanca del rey truli amaz would highli recommend peopl activ seek perform without hesit howev main drawback food first cours veget mill feuill superb howev main cours chose chicken whisper paella cut middl chicken bright pink uncook wish salmonella souvenir visit send back kitchen recook done wait long time main cours replac would also nice receiv apolog restaur took place unfortun apolog forthcom also main cours replac replac paella accompani meal dessert rice pud ok great pay minimum euro mal least could expect go contract food poison seat arrang also left someth desir initi seat face brick wall sever restrict sight stage complain seem littl attempt reseat insist would leav reimburs money paid see show start put coat go eventu move posit could see stage payment bill fine although made wait end add insult injuri waitress ask add tip bill servic includ stage explain could possibl tip food sub standard remind send chicken back kitchen told fortun contract salmonella want see superb flamenco venu excel howev pleas sure check food eat review come health warn,average review,3

We requested reservations for four for a midnight show by internet through the company's on-line reservation service, 23hours before the performance, and left a credit card number. However we did not receive a confirmation e-mail or phone call, even as late as 5 PM the next day--the day of the show. We made 3 calls to the ticket office that day but were told that if we had not yet received an e-mail confirmation or booking number, there was no reservation. We therefore made other plans for the evening, but were appalled to find the confirmatory e-mail the next day (sent at 5:38 PM, the afternoon of the show.) Sure enough, my credit card was charged for 128 euros ($198.09) for a show we never attended. Multiple phone calls and e-mails to the company requesting a refund were denied. My credit card company disputed the charge but eventually paid the bill, since we did not adhere to the flamenco company's 24 hour cancellation policy (kind of hard to comply when we were not advised of the reservation in a timely manner, plus we would have been thrilled to attend had we been aware of the reservation!) So, the reservation agent's laziness (thank you, Patricia Ledo) was not acknowledged as the real problem in our ""miscommunication."" And there was no language barrier since the transaction was handled by my daughter who was living in Madrid at the time and very fluent in Spanish.

They offer many creative and exceptional tapas, montaditos (tiny, creative, open-faced sandwiches), salads, cheeses and acorn fed ham and pork. We visited three times during our eight days in Madrid (once for dinner, once for breakfast--great options--and once for a quick lunch before we flew home) and tried over a dozen different dishes. All were wonderful and beautifully presented. I particularly liked their montaditos--which they call ""Whims for One""--including Guacamole with mushrooms, Confit cod fish, Foie micuit, and very tender sirloin roast beef with Dijon's mustard and roasted onions.They also specialize in sangrias and offer light and refreshing alternatives to the traditional version. The service was the warmest and most friendly we experienced in our three weeks in Spain. The all female staff speak at least some English and English menus are also available.

We were staying at the Ritz, who recommended and booked for us. I assume this is why we got one of the best tables right beside the stage. The venue is quite small, but was full, and the tables are very close together. I had to go to the loo before I sat down, as I'd never have got out again ! This is certainly mass catering, getting in as many tourists as possible - made me think of school dinners. The menu was confusing. There were 4 set menu options, or a la carte. The minumum charge per person was 35 euros for the show and 42 euros for the cheapest set menu. Having said that, the set menu did include half a bottle of wine and water.  We were put off just looking at the menu, as it seemed the cost could spiral out of control, and simply went for the cheapest option. I had mushroom soup to start, which was very nice. I had chicken for main with dried out paella, of which I ate very little. Dessert was fried custard which I couldnt eat. The wine was fine. The flamenco dancers came on around 21.30 and probably did about 90 minutes. The performers were all excellent and appeared to be very professional, with huge amounts of energy. I doubt anyone would be disappointed with the show, and it was longer than I expected. If you want to see flamenco, I'd go for the later show/drinks option.  Overall we were disappointed, especially as we'd been to La Capilla de la Bolsa the previous evening, which was outstanding (and cheaper).",2010-01-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or390-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17209,0.044,0.856,0.1,0.9503,0.0740601851851851,0.5147169312169313,0.3669,1523,139,0.0912672357189757,1,45,False,58,0.0526315789473684,0.0526315789473684,0.2894736842105263,0.0,0.1842105263157894,0.0526315789473684,0.0789473684210526,0.0526315789473684,0.1578947368421052,0.0789473684210526,286,181,4.321678321678322,0,0,us went restaur last friday dinner show perform stay ritz recommend book us assum got one best tabl right besid stage venu quit small full tabl close togeth go loo sat never got certainli mass cater get mani tourist possibl made think school dinner menu confus set menu option la cart minumum charg per person euro show euro cheapest set menu said set menu includ half bottl wine water put look menu seem cost could spiral control simpli went cheapest option mushroom soup start nice chicken main dri paella ate littl dessert fri custard couldnt eat wine fine flamenco dancer came around probabl minut perform excel appear profession huge amount energi doubt anyon would disappoint show longer expect want see flamenco go later show drink option overal disappoint especi la capilla de la bolsa previou even outstand cheaper,average review,3

We booked for the first session and started our dinner at 6:30pm. Being a busy and popular restaurant, the wait staff were exceptionally nice, friendly and attentive, special thanks to the young gentleman that served our table. We just couldn't praise them highly enough since they had to work in the dark when the show was in progress and maintained an unobtrusive efficiency throughout. The show was undoubtedly great with energetic performers. Guitar playing & singing also formed an important part of the show. Though not as eye-catching as the dances on such a small stage, it was worthy of your appreciation. I have heard the same in the old town of Cuenca, busking, which was really impressive as it perfectly blends into the atmosphere and feels very Spanish. We were seated in the front row, got an unobstructed view of the show, a closer look of the dance steps and a better connection with the performers. However be warned: you may got a stiff neck, and a shower of the performers' sweat, seriously! Our only gripe was the food...disappointing, not bad but certainly not phenomenal...maybe the pre-set menu was not the best that the restaurant could offer or we had expected too much.  Overall it's an unforgettable experience and we didn't regret going there at all. My 2 cents: choose the first session of the show in summer so that you could witness the beauty and awe of the sunset at Plaza de la Armería after the dinner show.

In the end, the only place we went twice was Bombardino Cafe, on a side street off the Calle de Santa Isabel not far from the main train station.  One thing we could not help but notice eating out in Madrid; there are the obviously touristy spots, the ones you read about in Lonely Planet, where you might hear some Spanish amongst the English/German/Swedish/French mix, and then there ware the places where the Spanish go. Bombardino is where the Spanish go when they want something modern yet cozy, light meals with some vegetarian options, and a very relaxed and artsy setting. And the best part, you can still find friendly owners who will take care of your wishes, even in English!  We sampled Bombardino (bbd) for both a late breakfast and dinner and were treated to wonderful service, great food, and a throughly charming atmosphere. The two owners were in the restaurant and served up good cheer with warmth and attention and they speak more languages than I will ever manage. There is a clearly Italian flavor to some of the dishes as one of the owners comes from Milan. But this is not a pizza joint, but rather a place where the two cuisines meet and mingle. And where also Spanish diners enjoy drinks, conversations, and yes, a romantic tryst or two!

Now it seemed very touristy to us and expensive for what was offered. We were given a drink of our choice (which was quite generous in size) and not even a 90 minute show for the admission charge of 88 euros. Thankfully we didn't opt for the dinner. It arrived at many different times during the show and we heard some comments that it was cold but I can't say more than that. The show opened with a group of three men playing guitars but within 15 minutes there was a break in the show til the dancers came on stage. Then three Flamenco dancers looked gorgeous and performed beautifully but before we knew it there was another break. They went back and forth with the guitarist at least two times, more likely three, during the show. We sat looking at each other during the breaks. If the music were continuous, at least. the lapses would not have been that obvious. The performances, however, were definitely fun to watch and the costumes and dances did not disappoint. We would efinitely recommend seeing Flamenco dancers while in Madrid but I wish I had done more homework and maybe found another place to go.",2011-10-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or370-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17273,0.0,0.86,0.14,0.9879,0.1308823529411764,0.5514705882352942,0.2963454545454546,1207,111,0.0919635459817729,0,24,False,38,0.0571428571428571,0.1428571428571428,0.2571428571428571,0.0571428571428571,0.2571428571428571,0.0285714285714285,0.0285714285714285,0.0571428571428571,0.0571428571428571,0.0571428571428571,222,148,4.441441441441442,0,0,understand place one local use go chose seem touristi us expens offer given drink choic quit gener size even minut show admiss charg euro thank opt dinner arriv mani differ time show heard comment cold say show open group three men play guitar within minut break show til dancer came stage three flamenco dancer look gorgeou perform beauti knew anoth break went back forth guitarist least two time like three show sat look break music continu least laps would obviou perform howev definit fun watch costum danc disappoint would efinit recommend see flamenco dancer madrid wish done homework mayb found anoth place go,average review,3

We had researched and planned on seeing a show in Barcelona but ran out of time and I was very disappointed (however now I am so happy that I saw this show at this venue instead!) so as we flew into Madrid airport we immediately went to the information desk and the very helpful young man gave us this venue as his first choice for a Flamenco show. I told him I wanted to see a good show. He had been so friendly and helpful with our transportation needs that were absolutely critical to us getting around that we trusted him. Well...like everything that he helped us with - it did not disappoint! We went to Corral de la Moreria the first day in Madrid. We took the metro to the stop Opera. We tried walking around the winding streets from the metro stop and kept getting lost. When we finally found the location (you see beautifully painted lamps outside) we saw an employee letting someone out. He was very helpful. We told him we wanted to see the Flamenco show and he asked if we had tickets. We said no but we wanted to buy them. He personally walked us up to an office and we were able to book them. Both employees were very nice and helpful. They were sold out for that night but we were able to get the tickets for the next day. I would strongly suggest to book online before you leave home and reserve your spot. Our trip would not have been as wonderful without seeing such a fabulous show and you wouldn’t want to be disappointed if you don’t get in! It is a smaller intimate venue. There are two shows one at 8:00 and one at 10:00. I would suggest that the day you do the Flamenco show you do the following itinerary: get off of the Metro stop “Opera”. Walk through Plaza De Oriente then tour the Palacio Real. We then walked down Calle de Bailen past the Jardines de Sabatini to Calle de Ferraz to Parque de la Montana to see the sunset at the Templo de Debod. Afterward we walked back toward the palace. The Corral de la Moreria is past the palace off of Calle de Bailen! It was so easy to get to from there! It is on the side of the palace just past the Jardines de las Vistillas on Calle de la Moreria! We walked since all these places are within walking distance from each other. So now...on with my review of Corral de la Moreria...we entered and were seated right away. We had opted for just the show and a drink. They offer a variety of drinks. The items you can choose from are marked with a Flamenco dancer beside the choices. My husband chose a beer and I chose an Flavored liquor. Delish and given in a generous glass! We decided because of time restraints not to chose the dining option but we would have wanted to choose that option. (David Garcia, Michelin star recipient, was hired in 2016 by Corral de la Moreria so who wouldn’t want to eat here? I don’t know if he is still there but no doubt his influence and teaching still is!) I would suggest going early to have your entire meal eaten before the show starts so your attention will be fixed on this fabulous show. I loved how they allow you to take pictures or video first (no flash) then they tell you it is no longer allowed. This allows you to capture the special moment to remember forever by recording so as to enjoy it time and time again since it is beautiful and something you never want to forget but then allows you to totally enjoy the experience with nothing distracting you like seeing the performance through a lens! You totally get immersed in the performance. I have been to NY broadway shows and in my opinion this show’s performers showed more passion and were so immersed in their performance that it was unlike any performance I’ve ever seen. Throughout the performance you are brought into the show. The guitarists sat down with you at the tables and even the dancers performed down off the stage right beside you before going onto the stage. Truly a performance that draws you into it. These performers were absolutely amazing! The guitar player’s performances made you feel like they gave a private serenade. With all of the performers you absolutely feel the passionate emotions as each piece is performed. You are given a program with the performers of the night. I absolutely loved all the performers. The Flamenco dancers with their beautiful costumes that I had longed to see, performed greater than all expectations I ever had or anticipated. Jesus, Vanessa, Anabel radiated great passion for their craft by their movements and facial expressions. I was especially pleasantly surprised by the ballerina! Her name is Estela Alonso. She performed the castanets as well as danced. It was something I didn’t expect in a Flamenco show but WOW! Such grace! This brought this show to another level! Again I say, Really Exceeding expections! I cannot see how anyone would choose another Flamenco show! These performers made their performance a true work of art! The level of talent here was amazing! I cannot praise this venue enough! Don’t miss out! You will see the famous faces that have been here in the pictures on the wall and on the website! The pamphlet they have says this is the most famous Tablao Flamenco in the world, it won the world’s best tablao flamenco award (from the most prestigious flamenco festival in Spain), and was selected by the book “1000 places to see before you die” (the NY Times #1 best seller). I totally agree! I will never forget this phenomenal experience. There may be cheaper venues out there but you get what you pay for and the possibility you will be dissappointed and feel the lesser money you spent was not even worth it! This experience at Corral de la Moreria was worth every euro spent! I would gladly spend it again for this once in a lifetime experience! If your gonna do something...do it right with everything you got. They do it perfect!",2018-01-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or80-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17278,0.034,0.781,0.185,0.9997,0.2707393861158921,0.5567699368904189,0.3436138888888889,5850,534,0.0912820512820512,27,110,False,156,0.1312217194570135,0.1447963800904977,0.2624434389140271,0.0542986425339366,0.2262443438914027,0.0271493212669683,0.0226244343891402,0.0090497737556561,0.0814479638009049,0.0407239819004524,1066,479,4.488742964352721,1,0,visit spain see flamenco show must research plan see show barcelona ran time disappoint howev happi saw show venu instead flew madrid airport immedi went inform desk help young man gave us venu first choic flamenco show told want see good show friendli help transport need absolut critic us get around trust well like everyth help us disappoint went corral de la moreria first day madrid took metro stop opera tri walk around wind street metro stop kept get lost final found locat see beauti paint lamp outsid saw employe let someon help told want see flamenco show ask ticket said want buy person walk us offic abl book employe nice help sold night abl get ticket next day would strongli suggest book onlin leav home reserv spot trip would wonder without see fabul show want disappoint get smaller intim venu two show one one would suggest day flamenco show follow itinerari get metro stop opera walk plaza de orient tour palacio real walk call de bailen past jardin de sabatini call de ferraz parqu de la montana see sunset templo de debod afterward walk back toward palac corral de la moreria past palac call de bailen easi get side palac past jardin de la vistilla call de la moreria walk sinc place within walk distanc review corral de la moreria enter seat right away opt show drink offer varieti drink item choos mark flamenco dancer besid choic husband chose beer chose flavor liquor delish given gener glass decid time restraint chose dine option would want choos option david garcia michelin star recipi hire corral de la moreria want eat know still doubt influenc teach still would suggest go earli entir meal eaten show start attent fix fabul show love allow take pictur video first flash tell longer allow allow captur special moment rememb forev record enjoy time time sinc beauti someth never want forget allow total enjoy experi noth distract like see perform len total get immers perform ny broadway show opinion show perform show passion immers perform unlik perform ever seen throughout perform brought show guitarist sat tabl even dancer perform stage right besid go onto stage truli perform draw perform absolut amaz guitar player perform made feel like gave privat serenad perform absolut feel passion emot piec perform given program perform night absolut love perform flamenco dancer beauti costum long see perform greater expect ever anticip jesu vanessa anabel radiat great passion craft movement facial express especi pleasantli surpris ballerina name estela alonso perform castanet well danc someth expect flamenco show wow grace brought show anoth level say realli exceed expect cannot see anyon would choos anoth flamenco show perform made perform true work art level talent amaz cannot prais venu enough miss see famou face pictur wall websit pamphlet say famou tablao flamenco world world best tablao flamenco award prestigi flamenco festiv spain select book place see die ny time best seller total agre never forget phenomen experi may cheaper venu get pay possibl dissappoint feel lesser money spent even worth experi corral de la moreria worth everi euro spent would gladli spend lifetim experi gonna someth right everyth got perfect,very good review,5

Invidious to single out one person as they are all super out but Liere would grace any restaurant as front of house. Also good linguists!!  Restaurant - beautifully presented and decorated.  Sangrias - very very good. 22,000 steps round Madrid in 37 degrees instantly dispelled by Sangria No 3.  Food - Fabulous, so tasty so interesting, Guacamole, Calamari, Cecina all stunning, everything else very good.

I do suggest looking at the website beforehand to get an idea of pricing. With this in mind yes it can be pricey especially if you go for the dinner but from having compared some of the other flamenco places that sit for dinner, they are pretty similar in pricing. There was also complaints about the audience taking videos and pictures during the performance. The announcements exclusively prohibit this and only allow for the first 5 minutes of the performance. We had no issues. For my friends and I, it was definitely worth it. It was my birthday celebration and we all agreed this would be a great end to a wonderful trip.

The dancers, singers, and guitar players were all wonderful. This was a very exciting evening! Now it’s a month later, and I’m still starry-eyed. Check the schedule, and make your reservations so that you start your meal early enough that you can be more or less finished with your meal when the show starts. Reason: during the show, the restaurant is blacked out. We were served our desserts during the show. I knew from the taste that it was chocolate and very delicious, but I couldn’t see what it was. Also, try to get a table close to the stage. The show is even more exciting close up. For dinner, we had an interesting salad (on some soggy, thin bread), and poached salmon, which was very fatty. Maybe it was farmed salmon. The service was fine. My only concern was this: A waiter dropped a (clean) wine glass. That can happen anywhere; I don’t criticize him for that. However, as a result, there were small pieces of broken glass in the area between the tables where people walked. It was quite a while before someone came with a broom to sweep up the glass. I pointed out to that person that there were many pieces of broken glass under another customer’s chair. The staff person nodded, but she swept only the main walking area, not under the chair. Also, even after the walking area had been swept, bits of broken glass remained.  Their website, in many languages, has a lot of information and many photos..",2017-11-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or90-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17304,0.052,0.821,0.127,0.9775,0.1818827160493827,0.572037037037037,0.318595,1479,132,0.0892494929006085,1,50,False,48,0.1044776119402985,0.1343283582089552,0.2238805970149253,0.0597014925373134,0.1492537313432835,0.0597014925373134,0.0298507462686567,0.0597014925373134,0.1044776119402985,0.0746268656716417,264,174,4.6022727272727275,0,0,food averag entertain outstand dancer singer guitar player wonder excit even month later still starri eye check schedul make reserv start meal earli enough less finish meal show start reason show restaur black serv dessert show knew tast chocol delici see also tri get tabl close stage show even excit close dinner interest salad soggi thin bread poach salmon fatti mayb farm salmon servic fine concern waiter drop clean wine glass happen anywher critic howev result small piec broken glass area tabl peopl walk quit someon came broom sweep glass point person mani piec broken glass anoth custom chair staff person nod swept main walk area chair also even walk area swept bit broken glass remain websit mani languag lot inform mani photo,average review,3

My husband and I had an enjoyable evening here. Our favorite dish was a mushroom and tender garlic scramble, and the gazpacho was really nice too. However, Casa Lolea is EXTREMELY touristy and I wouldn't go back for that reason. The entire place was packed with people who seemed to be from Germany, the Netherlands etc., all speaking English.  We're here for a language immersion in Spanish, so this is the type of place we'd generally avoid because touristy places are the worst for getting ""Englished"" based on how you look and the fact that you're not a native Spanish speaker. Even if you ask them to speak Spanish with you, they'll still ""forget"" and go back into English, which is not only super awkward but also frustrating when you've put a huge amount of effort and time into traveling to a country for language immersion. I've found the best/only way to avoid this is to avoid touristy places. I recommend this place if you're looking for good tapas, good sangria and you are NOT in Spain for language tourism.",2019-07-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d17413088-Reviews-or80-Casa_Lolea_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_927,0.077,0.794,0.129,0.8606,0.1378472222222222,0.5663194444444445,0.4760625,1107,94,0.084914182475158,0,33,False,41,0.12,0.18,0.26,0.08,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.08,0.0,196,129,4.6479591836734695,0,0,food good sangria good space pretti well decor husband enjoy even favorit dish mushroom tender garlic scrambl gazpacho realli nice howev casa lolea extrem touristi go back reason entir place pack peopl seem germani netherland etc speak english languag immers spanish type place gener avoid touristi place worst get english base look fact nativ spanish speaker even ask speak spanish still forget go back english super awkward also frustrat put huge amount effort time travel countri languag immers found best way avoid avoid touristi place recommend place look good tapa good sangria spain languag tourism,average review,3

So I was pre-disposed against the place since before we arrived but my friends insisted and I obliged. The first impression of a busload full of Easter European tourists waiting outside to get in almost made me turn around. We had a reservation for dinner and the show which starts after dinner is over (around 22:30hrs) and lasts about an hour and a half. We were sat at a table right in front of the stage and had a perfect view, but some areas of the restaurant have partially obstructed views because of columns. Dinner was fairly good though not cheap and the dinner service was attentive and courteous. But let's face it, the star here is the show. Been of Spanish descent and having been to Spain many times I have seen some good ones. The Moreria troop puts on one of the best.

I can wholeheartedly agree with the places rating, it is great! The first thing being the staff - both the guys who served us were very warm and welcoming as well as attentive and efficient- all of which I found lacking in many places I've eaten at in Madrid. They could both speak english and helped us with ordering- there is english on the menu too which helps! The interior is quite funky, eclectic and relaxed. Nothing pretentious or cheesy which is nice.  We ordered some raciones including grilled squid with salad, shredded flank steak and boletus risotto with crispy bacon. Everything was delicious, particularly the last two which were interesting and unusual dishes for us. We were too full for dessert but the guys insisted we tried a complementary shot of a local liquor- very welcome and also delicious! If it wasn't lunch time and we hadn't places to go we could have easily spent longer here. The prices were very reasonable and I think the place offers excellent value for money. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here and regret not having time to spend longer or to return again during our holiday.

I had a goat cheese salad, salmon, and the chocolate dessert. All were satisfying but not over the top. There was a couple who came right before the show that just ordered wine, tapas, and dessert...I was a little jealous of their smarts. Also the stage is very small and if you aren't towards the front you might have to get up and stand along the wall to see the performers' feet as they stomp out their flamenco. The show was good but it was a little irritating when the waiters/waitresses would get up and serve things during the dancing.

Booking the table for show and dinner was the first step, guaranting ourselves an evening to remember. Stepping into the restaurant is like going into a bygone era, the decor is grand. The chairs and tables though look cramped for space. Drinks came in as we settled, followed by some bread. The first course was lovely and set the tone for the evening Delicious. The main course and the desserts were just yum.  But the highlight of the evening was the dance performance which simply took out breath away. The singers took the tempo high with their vocals and brought life to the evening. And the dancers just captivated our senses. It's a performance that needs to be experienced and no amount of vocabulary will do justice to that experience.

The Tromp l'oeil Parmesan risotto with truffle oil is also sensational. The tuna tataki is out of this world - we are raving about it still. The patatas bravas were excellent. The hummus is also good, The octopus tentacle was quite good it has a smoky (think hickory) flavor that may not appeal to all palates.

We had been promised a 20% discount and a seat immediately by the man who walked us over. We then waited 15 minutes for our table but eventually were sat. The servers were lovely, but obviously overrun, however they did their best to attend to our every need. Our server explained the menu very well to us and gave us pointers as to what to have, as it was a little confusing and not laid out like a conventional menu. The sangria pitcher we had was gorgeous, it had gin in it which was a nice, modern twist on a classic. The bao buns we had as a starter were exquisite, however, it went rapidly downhill with the main course paella. It was nicely cooked, or so we thought until we returned home and spent the night alternating between toilet and bed. And yes, we did clean the prawns out.

We sat outside which was lovely despite the busy road behind us. The service was very efficient and friendly and you got the sense that nothing was too much for them. For food we ordered calamari to share and then the Hake and for dessert the chocolate mousse (despite the waiter's attempt to get us to try the passionfruit soup!). All of the food was delicious, the fish was cooked particularly well and served with some really nice vegetables. We also had some cocktails (mojitos which were very nice and the house cocktail which was lovely as long as you like strong gin cocktails!). It was pricier than the other places we had eaten at in Madrid but was definitely more of a fine dining experience which is what we were looking for. The only thing that left a slightly sour taste in the mouth was that bread and oil was brought to the table but they charged for it - there was no mention of a charge and they did not ask if we would like the bread so we assumed it was complimentary as it had been everywhere else we had eaten.

The pork Presa Iberica was however dry, overcooked and inedible - David became less cheerful on this and informed us repeatedly it was their most expensive meat (which just made it worse, since he wasn't offering any replacement or price reduction).

Overall, the restaurant has good points and some a little less good sides. Reading the reviews of other people and other restaurants I impose the conclusion that obviously a lot of it depends on which part of the world you come from. Americans are more enthusiastic about Europe, while Europeans are more enthusiastic about America. We chose La Mi Venta restaurant reading other reviews on Trip Advisor. We made reservation via the Internet and there was no problem. Welcome to the restaurant was at a high level and professional and very friendly. As we had booked dinner for 20:00 the restaurant was nearly empty. We asked the waiter to recommend us what to eat and drink. On his recommendation, we took the T-bone steak, green peppers, potatoes, salad and wine and as a starter Jamon. Now ..... those doubts from the beginning of the text. The ambience of the restaurant ...... OK, but nothing special. In my country there are lots of such restaurants and not something that impressed me, and certainly not left a WOW effect. Nice, clean, neat, comfortable, but nothing special. Food ...... well it is difficult to say. In short, I ate better, but I was eating worse. Jamon was maybe a little too greasy. I say maybe. For the taste of my wife it was. T-bone, in my opinion, a bit too greasy, but OK. Potatoes good, good salad, good wine. All in all, good and average, but nothing really special. Maybe we chose the wrong, maybe We have not been lucky. But for the end I would like to complimented restaurant staff who were very friendly on arrival and on departure and dedicated us their full attention.  Would I recommend La Me Venta to others? I would  Would I come again? Yes and I will. PS.

It was not particularly busy when I arrived as it was quite early and I choose an outside table, which had a partial view of the lovely Palace. I had already looked at the menu on the internet and had picked out the Entrecote steak. Perhaps it was just an off day, but unfortunately the meat was a bit on the chewy side and although asking for rare, it was also cooked closer to medium rare - this was fine though. The accompanying potatoes with green peppers was very nice, but the main part of the meal as mentioned was just average compared to many other restaurants I have visited charging similar rates (about 20 Euros). The service was attentive and I could not fault that aspect. This may be Spanish related, but the annoying thing was that some bread and olive oil had been brought to my table when I arrived. I assumed that this was complementary, as it is still at many restaurants, but upon checking the bill I was charged for this without being asked if I wanted it. I did not query this at is was just less than 2 Euros and I had had a long day and did not want to get into an argument. If there are extras, then a restaurant should really make this clear if they are to be charged though. I would like to give it a second chance if I returned, but with so many other good restaurants to choose from, I will likely not be returning.",2014-04-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or910-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_17411,0.05,0.86,0.091,0.9304,0.1256372549019608,0.4825980392156863,0.37483,1482,159,0.1072874493927125,0,26,False,59,0.0967741935483871,0.1290322580645161,0.2580645161290322,0.0967741935483871,0.1935483870967742,0.064516129032258,0.0,0.0,0.0967741935483871,0.064516129032258,285,169,4.203508771929824,0,0,base excel review realli look forward meal la mi venta short walk hotel particularli busi arriv quit earli choos outsid tabl partial view love palac alreadi look menu internet pick entrecot steak perhap day unfortun meat bit chewi side although ask rare also cook closer medium rare fine though accompani potato green pepper nice main part meal mention averag compar mani restaur visit charg similar rate euro servic attent could fault aspect may spanish relat annoy thing bread oliv oil brought tabl arriv assum complementari still mani restaur upon check bill charg without ask want queri less euro long day want get argument extra restaur realli make clear charg though would like give second chanc return mani good restaur choos like return,average review,3

The restaurant itself is situated downstairs in a cellar and this adds to the old world charm of the place. You really do get a sense that you are somewhere different.

The food and service (including Ivan, the bartender and the waiter)were superb, as was the ambiance. Upstairs there is casual dining at the bar and a few tables; downstairs there are two dining rooms; and out front there are a few tables. The family is responsible for importing a special type of jambon from another region in Spain, which is not to be missed. Indeed, all of the courses were tremendous. This is a small restaurant near the Palace, the Senate building, and other popular sites so I would make reservations in advance, if possible. I cannot say enough good things about this place so I will end by simply recommending that if you want to have an excellent meal at an authentic Spanish restaurant that is staffed by very nice and professional people, make plans to go here.",2014-07-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or890-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_9013,0.024,0.844,0.132,0.9619,0.2111580086580086,0.5668290043290043,0.4766166666666667,1016,94,0.09251968503937,0,21,False,35,0.0769230769230769,0.1538461538461538,0.4102564102564102,0.0512820512820512,0.2307692307692307,0.0,0.0,0.0256410256410256,0.0512820512820512,0.0,181,122,4.6187845303867405,0,0,arrang small group dinner la mi venta ivan member famili own restaur could nicer cooper respons arrang dinner dinner food servic includ ivan bartend waiter superb ambianc upstair casual dine bar tabl downstair two dine room front tabl famili respons import special type jambon anoth region spain miss inde cours tremend small restaur near palac senat build popular site would make reserv advanc possibl cannot say enough good thing place end simpli recommend want excel meal authent spanish restaur staf nice profession peopl make plan go,good review,4

The waiters were super attentive and never let your glasses go empty. The food was hands down incredible, i still crave it ALL THE TIME. we got the spanish omellette which was so light and fluffy and the potatoes were cooked to perfection. we had tried a lot of omelets other places and those barely touched this one. The iberica Jamon plate, i recommend getting the largest plate because you will want more, was probably one of the best things I've put in my mouth. i became a Iberica Jamon addict in Spain and tried it at every restaurant we went to, but La Mi Venta's was hands down the best no competition. We also got the bread with tomato which you get everywhere in spain, but this place still managed to be better then everyone else for such a simple thing. the tomato's were so fresh and they gave you such a generous serving of the tomato spread unlike everywhere else where they do such an incredibly thin thin thin layer. The olive oil they give you to start off with your bread is amazing, the best quality olive oil you can find! The owner of this restaurant was one of the most amazing guy's i have ever met. This man has a real passion for food and truly cooks from his heart and cares about quality, he's not in this for the money he's in it for the love of the food and you can truly see that. after the meal you get a complimentary shot that differs in kind all the time. The prices are reasonable for the quality that you are getting, if you want a dirt cheap price then your going to get dirt cheap quality food.

Waiter Santiago and host Cristian were very attentive and helpful in explaining many inventive menu items to Spanish language challenged travellers such as us. The Cajon de Esto no es Tomato (translated ""This is not a tomato!"") turns out to be a tomato shaped vegetable tortilla, lightly fried and paired with a tasty dipping sauce that changes daily.

Ivan spoke English and helped coordinate the menu by email to accommodate our budget.

It is HOT in madrid . . . not that that is a bad thing! The wait staff was professional and approachable . . . Those two don't always go together. We enjoyed the many courses. The ham fed from the acorn eating pigs-- a must. The salad was delicious with asparagus and many different fresh lettuce varieties. The coal grilled steak was divine. The vegetable dishes perfect as well. And there was not a fried egg any where. We were getting a little sick of the fried egg plopped on French fries or salad! The dessert platters were a lovely variety of apple and cherry pie, cheesecake soufflé ice cream, lemon meringue and fabulous chocolates to top it off.

I came to Spain a couple of times before but never had the chance to attend a Flamenco Show. I read few reviews and decided to visit el Corral de la Moreria, had more expectations about the show than the food. I hardly know about flamenco, can say dancers and singers look absolutely passionate about what they were doing, I don't know if flamenco stages are always that small, or if the combination between women and men is the right one, but I'm extremely into fine dining and everything about food, and I have to say dinner was amazing. My wife had the Lamb and I had a fillet of Lubina as mains, we had the Ox carpaccio and the grilled tomato filled with Squid (chipirones) over black risotto (made with Squid's ink).

While the best place to watch Flamenco is probably in Seville and we did visit it, the timing did not work for us so we decided to do it in Madrid. This was truly the highlight of our trip to Spain. When we were researching this place, we realized that this place is booked sometimes months in advance.We decided to take our chances because we were booking in low season and pretty much got the last few seats. There are three available choices and we chose to go for the choice in the middle ( approx $ 125 per person ) which included dinner as well as the show. We were apprehensive about dinner, but that turned out to be the most enjoyable and delicious meal we had in Spain. The seating is cramped with barely any elbow room, but the service was amazing. Our server was amazing and took all our orders when we sat down and even reserved our desserts for us. If you have a sweet tooth like me, get the dessert sampler. It was amazing! The main course was veal and the starters included tiger shrimp. This included a glass of wine and if you ask they will swap the wine for Sangria, like they did for me. We had primarily gone there for the flamenco so we weren't expecting to be fed this well.  Now about the dance...there was live music and 5 flamenco dancers performing the dance. We were told in Seville that Flamenco dancing took inspiration from Indian clasical dance and sure enough the footwork of Flamenco reminded me of the classical dance form of Katthak. The dancers were extremely graceful and the performance was spell binding. It started after dinner got over at about 10 pm and continue for almost an hour and half. If you are in Madrid and would like a cultural experience, I would say this is a must do. We visited the palace and the Prado too, but this is surely the experience I will remember for ever. The staff at this place is great. Make sure you book in advance if you go during tourist season!!",2012-01-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or360-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17544,0.004,0.814,0.183,0.9976,0.3012352693602693,0.5040740740740741,0.2886761904761905,2004,191,0.0953093812375249,3,38,False,70,0.140625,0.15625,0.34375,0.078125,0.140625,0.015625,0.0,0.0625,0.03125,0.03125,374,219,4.358288770053476,0,0,trip spain would complet without trip watch flamenco best place watch flamenco probabl sevil visit time work us decid madrid truli highlight trip spain research place realiz place book sometim month advanc decid take chanc book low season pretti much got last seat three avail choic chose go choic middl approx per person includ dinner well show apprehens dinner turn enjoy delici meal spain seat cramp bare elbow room servic amaz server amaz took order sat even reserv dessert us sweet tooth like get dessert sampler amaz main cours veal starter includ tiger shrimp includ glass wine ask swap wine sangria like primarili gone flamenco expect fed well danc live music flamenco dancer perform danc told sevil flamenco danc took inspir indian clasic danc sure enough footwork flamenco remind classic danc form katthak dancer extrem grace perform spell bind start dinner got pm continu almost hour half madrid would like cultur experi would say must visit palac prado sure experi rememb ever staff place great make sure book advanc go tourist season,very good review,5

You have to reserve well in advance to have a dinner on the eve of Christmas day so why not go to most prominent place? I do not know anything about music, dancing and flamenco in particular so have no right to judge the experience, but it was amazing. I am not a big fan of gourmet cuisine either and usually prefer more plain food (and bigger portions), but in Corral de Moreria even the cheapest basic menu was tasty and sufficient. Place was tightly packed, but most of the seating places including our had a very good view at the show. It became stuffy at the end of the show.

We opted for the a la carte dinner as one of our party has food allergies. There was a minimum price of 43 euros, which matched the set menu price. The tables were a bit cramped and close together. We had a very relaxed waitress who spoke good English, and we enjoyed all the food. The service was not rushed and we were ready for the show which started promptly at 22.00. What a show! Brilliant dancers, great guitarists and singers. It was mesmerising! The colors and sounds stay in your mind for a long time.

Unfortunately, we had an extremely unpleasant (and very expensive!) experience. First of all: the table. Right at the bottom of the room, on the side of the stage, next to the kitchen. Poor and reduced view of the show, constant noise from the kitchen, the waiters going back and forth durng the show and disturbing the view. And we payed exactly the same as the people sitting in the front row! The dinner: all the glasses on the table were dirty, so we asked to replace them. The food is good, but it is extremely overpriced. Plus, the VAT isn't comprised in the prices showed on the menu, which is illegal in Spain. Being the VAT at 21%, the surprise on the bill is big. We payed more than 40€ per person for a one-course meal, more than then double of a normal restaurant in Madrid. In addition, portions are very limited. Maybe the people having a very expensive drink in the front row had a better experience, but I will surely never EVER go back to El Corral de la Moreria. Worst dinner experience in over 6 months in Madrid. Do not come here for dinner, do not come here for the flamenco, do not come here for drinks.

I also really liked the staff, and they were all very kind and friendly and they genuinely seemed to believe in the restaurant and the mission to give great service and provide excellent food in a beautiful setting.

We had an absolute blast at this restaurant! I cannot say enough about what a great time our group had! My boyfriend and I debated for several months about going here on New Year’s Eve with his goddaughter on our trip to Spain because it was rather pricy… but it was a phenomenal night and I highly recommend it! (His goddaughter even said it was “the best night of her life”. This was a graduation gift, so she was old enough to appreciate the food and entertainment. I’m not sure if it would have been as good had she been younger.) For about $300 per person: *7:30pm-1:30am *6 dinner courses *Dessert *Champagne, 2 white wines, 1 red wine, and 1 sherry (all perfectly paired with the food and refills included) *Water (worth mentioning, because we needed it with as much alcohol that was available) *“Grapes of Luck” at midnight *Bag of fun party favors, hats, etc. *Full night of entertainment – guitars, singers, and flamenco dancers STAFF – Our waiter, Sergio, was incredibly attentive and charming. He kept our waters and wines full all night and even brought us an extra dessert because he saw that we enjoyed it so much. He also found time to get us onstage so we could get a group picture. FOOD – Absolutely gourmet! The courses included: 1. ""Royal de Foie Gras” with Sliced Black Truffles 2. Winter Orchard (sort of an interesting veggie dish) 3. Free Range Egg Yolk with Pheasant Consommé and Caviar 4. Grilled Lobster with Thyme Confit Potatoes and Creamy Lobster Coral Soup 5. Roasted Sea Bass, Stewed Spring Onion and Citrus Vinaigrette with Sanlucar Manzanilla Sherry 6. Roasted Rack of Lamb on a Chestnut and Duck Gizzard Ragout with Fresh Shoots 7. Caramelized French Toast in Fresh Milk and Vanilla Bourbon with Guanaja Cocoa Ice Cream Everything was delicious and full of interesting flavors. Each course was distinct and I couldn’t believe how complex the sauces were. Exceptional! ENTERTAINMENT – We felt like we were at a party with all friends. The setting at this restaurant is incredibly intimate. All of the performers were absolutely extraordinary! We went to another flamenco show in Seville earlier in the week, but this group somehow felt much more passionate. (And they looked like they were really enjoying the evening too!) TRANSPORTATION – The restaurant contacted us before the date and arranged to have us shuttled home so we didn’t have to walk back to our hotel inebriated after a long, fun, and busy evening. Overall, I would still consider the evening fairly expensive, but the value came through the six hours of gourmet food, stellar entertainment, considerate staff, provided transportation, and open bar. We felt that an a la carte experience with the same factors could have easily been more expensive per person. So once we were committed to the cost, it was great to have a no-stress, “everything included” New Year’s Eve evening. Undeniably the best New Year’s Eve ever! Small note: The other reviews I’ve read are correct - there is a pole that sometimes hinders the view of the stage. If the stage is a diamond shape, it is in the bottom corner. The performers moved so often that it didn’t really bother us.",2017-01-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or120-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17587,0.009,0.762,0.229,0.9994,0.2614750445632798,0.4729961378490789,0.3649852941176471,3185,215,0.0675039246467817,9,87,False,104,0.1415094339622641,0.1698113207547169,0.3679245283018867,0.0754716981132075,0.1792452830188679,0.0094339622641509,0.0,0.0188679245283018,0.0283018867924528,0.0094339622641509,550,344,4.792727272727273,0,0,best new year eve ever absolut blast restaur cannot say enough great time group boyfriend debat sever month go new year eve goddaught trip spain rather prici phenomen night highli recommend goddaught even said best night life graduat gift old enough appreci food entertain sure would good younger per person pm dinner cours dessert champagn white wine red wine sherri perfectli pair food refil includ water worth mention need much alcohol avail grape luck midnight bag fun parti favor hat etc full night entertain guitar singer flamenco dancer staff waiter sergio incred attent charm kept water wine full night even brought us extra dessert saw enjoy much also found time get us onstag could get group pictur food absolut gourmet cours includ royal de foie gra slice black truffl winter orchard sort interest veggi dish free rang egg yolk pheasant consomm caviar grill lobster thyme confit potato creami lobster coral soup roast sea bass stew spring onion citru vinaigrett sanlucar manzanilla sherri roast rack lamb chestnut duck gizzard ragout fresh shoot caramel french toast fresh milk vanilla bourbon guanaja cocoa ice cream everyth delici full interest flavor cours distinct believ complex sauc except entertain felt like parti friend set restaur incred intim perform absolut extraordinari went anoth flamenco show sevil earlier week group somehow felt much passion look like realli enjoy even transport restaur contact us date arrang us shuttl home walk back hotel inebri long fun busi even overal would still consid even fairli expens valu came six hour gourmet food stellar entertain consider staff provid transport open bar felt la cart experi factor could easili expens per person commit cost great stress everyth includ new year eve even undeni best new year eve ever small note review read correct pole sometim hinder view stage stage diamond shape bottom corner perform move often realli bother us,very good review,5

If you have dinner before the show at the restaurant you will get better seating, but we are not sure if its worth it. Dinner with wine cost us 130 Euros for 2 people. The show cost us around $107 (not Euros). I would stay away from the Paella. While people think its traditional Spanish fare, its actually quite touristy in its preparation. Go for a fish dish instead as they seemed to be much nicer. Dessert was the best part fo the meal, get the 5 chocolate one if you dare. Service overall was very good and they do speak many languages, including English and German. Since if you go there you are going for the show ASK TO BE SEATED AS FAR AWAY FROM THE BAR AS POSSIBLE. The staff is very noisy and it distracts from the show. There are also a couple of beams that get iin the way, but that is a minor distraction, but ask for the unobstructed view. We got there at 7:30 for the 8:00 show and we were the first ones in line. This would be fun for children over age 7 or so since there is singing and guitar playing plus the dancing, s younger children might get bored. I must note we did not see children there, however our children would have enjoyed it. After the show, walk down the street to your left to get a taxi before everyone else figures out there are no taxi's waiting outside the restaurant.",2012-06-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or330-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17600,0.062,0.829,0.109,0.9564,0.1184126984126984,0.408015873015873,0.27302,1434,126,0.0878661087866108,0,35,False,67,0.1666666666666666,0.119047619047619,0.238095238095238,0.0476190476190476,0.2619047619047619,0.0238095238095238,0.0,0.0,0.0952380952380952,0.0476190476190476,273,184,4.256410256410256,0,0,tough review sinc realli enjoy entertain star thought food disappoint star dinner show restaur get better seat sure worth dinner wine cost us euro peopl show cost us around euro would stay away paella peopl think tradit spanish fare actual quit touristi prepar go fish dish instead seem much nicer dessert best part fo meal get chocol one dare servic overal good speak mani languag includ english german sinc go go show ask seat far away bar possibl staff noisi distract show also coupl beam get iin way minor distract ask unobstruct view got show first one line would fun children age sinc sing guitar play plu danc younger children might get bore must note see children howev children would enjoy show walk street left get taxi everyon els figur taxi wait outsid restaur,average review,3

The first show was available if we also had dinner, and since we're traveling with our 9-year old daughter, the 11:30 p.m. was too late.  First, the food. My wife and I chose one of the prix fixe menus. The first course of huge prawns was all right, following by the paella that also had prawns, which was too many prawns in one meal. Perhaps I don't know what authentic Spanish paella should taste like, but this is my second bad paella experience in one week. It was too salty. The chocolate dessert was the best part of the meal. We ordered the tortilla de patatas for our daughter, which usually never disappoints. Unfortunately, this recipe oddly used onions, which is common in American recipes but not Spanish, according to my wife who lived in Madrid for a year. So our daughter, who doesn't like onions made it through a couple of small pieces. Our waiter took it away and brought back an omelette and fries––success. Why don't they have some kids options? The Corral has the best flamenco music and dance show in Madrid, so no problem there. The three guitarists and three male singers came out first. The percussion of the singers' feet and handclaps was rhythmic and powerful all night. Such a pleasure to be in an acoustic atmosphere with no amplification! The three lady dancers were fabulous, and the solo male and female featured dancers were simply out of this world.  The show has three sections separated by two solo guitar features. This is the point where I wanted to smack some people around, since everyone started talking as it were an intermission with no music. The performers will give you a better performance if they think you are actually listening, plus it's rude to those who want to hear it clearly without your chatter. Eventually most people caught on and quit talking. Remember, he's not a jukebox, he's a human being. One other issue: there is a big sign in the foyer that instructs everyone to avoid flash photography for the safety of the dancers on a three-foot stage. It's also annoying to everyone around you to be in the middle of a strobo/lightning storm. Care to guess how many flashes went off in the course of an hour and a half?  So in summary: the flamenco music and dance is great. Food is probably good, depending on what you order (avoid the paella). Many of your fellow tourists from around the globe may be unfamiliar with live performance decorum, hence the talking and the flashing during the show. If you don't have kids with you, eat dinner somewhere else and hit the 11:30 p.m. show.",2012-05-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or340-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17611,0.049,0.827,0.124,0.9914,0.1334437671172365,0.3935617103984451,0.3506275862068965,2622,218,0.0831426392067124,1,73,False,83,0.0493827160493827,0.1604938271604938,0.2345679012345679,0.0246913580246913,0.1604938271604938,0.074074074074074,0.0246913580246913,0.0617283950617283,0.1358024691358024,0.074074074074074,463,272,4.658747300215983,0,0,visit corral primarili experi flamenco sing danc first show avail also dinner sinc travel year old daughter p late first food wife chose one prix fix menu first cours huge prawn right follow paella also prawn mani prawn one meal perhap know authent spanish paella tast like second bad paella experi one week salti chocol dessert best part meal order tortilla de patata daughter usual never disappoint unfortun recip oddli use onion common american recip spanish accord wife live madrid year daughter like onion made coupl small piec waiter took away brought back omelett fri success kid option corral best flamenco music danc show madrid problem three guitarist three male singer came first percuss singer feet handclap rhythmic power night pleasur acoust atmospher amplif three ladi dancer fabul solo male femal featur dancer simpli world show three section separ two solo guitar featur point want smack peopl around sinc everyon start talk intermiss music perform give better perform think actual listen plu rude want hear clearli without chatter eventu peopl caught quit talk rememb jukebox human one issu big sign foyer instruct everyon avoid flash photographi safeti dancer three foot stage also annoy everyon around middl strobo lightn storm care guess mani flash went cours hour half summari flamenco music danc great food probabl good depend order avoid paella mani fellow tourist around globe may unfamiliar live perform decorum henc talk flash show kid eat dinner somewher els hit p show,average review,3

Firstly, the manager wanted to give me a table a bit further from the stage, but I asked for a closer one and he kindly agreed. I was dancing for over 12 years, so I can appreciate the fine dancing. I must say that this flamenco performance was amazing! The dancers were passionate, expressive and extremely charismatic! They literally took my breath away! The show was accompanied by the talented singers and musicians, which in combination created a perfect atmosphere! The service was good and in the end I got a chance to take a pic with the dancers.

Located in the Calle Santa Isabel 35 St, just north of Reina Sofia, this wonderful and crowded restaurant provides a cheerful oasis of sweet tastes and friendly staff that will keep you coming back for more. We tried a range of dishes, from kalamari to beef stakes, and were over and over stunned by the pleasantness of them; the risotto provided the prologue to what would become the best meal my family and myself had during our stay in Madrid, and as chicken, kalamari and pork followed, the closure was a selection of cakes that smelled and tasted like mum's. In fact, not only the cakes evoked that feeling; you can sense that the masters at work in the kitchen are crafting the dishes the same way they do at home. Nothing is superficial, and all is perfect. In the end, I thanked the young and charismatic owner Johnny for a wonderful evening, and told him this was the finest birthday meal I ever had, as it truly was. A couple of moments later - a plate with a lemon cake arrived at our table, with 'Happy Birthday!' written in Spanish on it. On the house, naturally. What more can I say? What a wonderful evening.

We had a wonderful meal of langostines with lobster sauce, paella, and their famous five chocolate dessert. We were fortunate to get a table right next to the stage so we could really see the dancers. There are tables there where large posts/columns partially block the view and there are tables to the right of the stage and far in back that likely have a poor view as well. This is definetly a place where you either need to reserve specific seating or arrive early to get a good table. We hadn't seen a flameco show before but we were very impressed with both the dancers and the musicians. I love Spanish guitar music and they played between each of the dances so lots of wonderful music.

We had made a reservation for the show only, not for dinner. The room was about 1/4 full at the time and they placed us at a table that had not one but two columns blocking our view of the stage. Neither my husband nor I could see anything. We requested moving to a different table and wow, it was as if we were asking for a huge favor. No, it couldn't be done, we were told. Maybe if they weren't sold out they could move us. We asked a second person and no, he said, maybe in 10 minutes, maybe. A waiter asked for our drink order and told us once we ordered that we couldn't change seats so please order now. We said no, we would order after we moved. Finally we were moved to a table at the front corner of the stage. One of us could see, the other still had an obstructed view.   In hindsight, EVERY table has a pretty bad view. Most are obstructed to some degree. Maybe I'm not a flamenco lover, but I never would know that because this was my first experience with it. The dance and music were great, but know that the dance is loud and the singing is over-modulated. This place might have great reviews but their attitude towards us was quite poor. We felt taken advantage of as tourists, which is strange considering the number of tourists in the venue.

I had arrived with my parents after wandering aimlessly around Madrid for a place to eat. We were greeted with nothing but smiles. We had not made a reservation, (highly recommend to make one) but because of this, we were sat down at the bar on front of the kitchen. To be able to sit in front of the kitchen, is considered the best seat in the house in my opinion. After being guided to our seats, we immediately felt at home as we were attended by both the bartender and server, (Fredrick and Vanessa respectively). The casual demeanor they both had, left all of us completely melt in comfort by them as they patiently and attentively aided us through the menu. Immediately describing the dishes with thorough knowledge, as well as describing the vision of the business cleverly seen through the decor. All 3 of us ordered a different cocktail and to our surprise of different flavour profiles, each one shinned in its meticulous understanding of ingredients and balance that was felt on the palate.  We started of with the croquettes; crunchy, soft, gooey with a kick of iberico ham worked perfectly.  Quickly followed by the tuna Tataki, which brightly showcased understanding of local ingredients with perfect respect of Japanese techniques.  What followed was a glass dome filled with a swirling cloud of curiosity. It was a fish dish; skin seared, topped with wakame and a side of a ratatouille as it's known in French cuisine. With nothing to hide behind, confidence of the chef could be seen intermingled with an ocean saltiness and the perfect pairing of what I could assume was Applewood smoke. The final dish that we tried was the Bao bun with iberico. What I was completely blown away by was the sauce. The perfect balance on all areas of the palate, left no room for the tongue to make sense of it all. Sweet, sour, salty, umami flavour permeated throughout the dish with the bun completing the balance with an underlying sweetness that lingered throughout the dish. This place showcases the influences the inhabitants of Madrid. It is a restaurant that you cannot leave Madrid without trying.",2018-08-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10358028-Reviews-or550-Inclan_Brutal_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_724,0.014,0.81,0.176,0.9972,0.2159814814814814,0.5276296296296297,0.3997157894736842,2213,183,0.0826931766832354,0,46,False,48,0.1594202898550724,0.1304347826086956,0.3478260869565217,0.0579710144927536,0.1594202898550724,0.0144927536231884,0.0144927536231884,0.0434782608695652,0.0579710144927536,0.0144927536231884,383,226,4.772845953002611,0,0,like start say weekend spain made entir memor due come arriv parent wander aimlessli around madrid place eat greet noth smile made reserv highli recommend make one sat bar front kitchen abl sit front kitchen consid best seat hous opinion guid seat immedi felt home attend bartend server fredrick vanessa respect casual demeanor left us complet melt comfort patient attent aid us menu immedi describ dish thorough knowledg well describ vision busi cleverli seen decor us order differ cocktail surpris differ flavour profil one shin meticul understand ingredi balanc felt palat start croquett crunchi soft gooey kick iberico ham work perfectli quickli follow tuna tataki brightli showcas understand local ingredi perfect respect japanes techniqu follow glass dome fill swirl cloud curios fish dish skin sear top wakam side ratatouil known french cuisin noth hide behind confid chef could seen intermingl ocean salti perfect pair could assum applewood smoke final dish tri bao bun iberico complet blown away sauc perfect balanc area palat left room tongu make sens sweet sour salti umami flavour permeat throughout dish bun complet balanc underli sweet linger throughout dish place showcas influenc inhabit madrid restaur cannot leav madrid without tri,very good review,5

I haven't had a bad thing here yet actually. From the mouth watering meats, to the burrata with a syringe of pesto to fill it with, and my personal favorite, the aromatic, tender and flavorful Octopus... I dream of it regularly. To be honest its a rather busy spot that isn't incredibly large. In fact the last two times I visited, it was busy and full but being solo in the city I was able to secure a spot at the small bar and at a small table the other time. So be warned, make a reservation to secure a spot or go during lunch time.

Anthony Bourdain himself (rest in peace) would agree. Small menu and impeccable attention to detail. The food was fresh, authentic and true to the Spanish pallet. My service by Frederic was the best I’ve had since I landed in Spain. He made adjustments to my menu was beyond friendly and extremely professional.

You can make a reservation on their website--just follow the link on TA's listing and select ""English"" to make the reservation. The food was good--mostly tapas but more substantial than your typical tapas joint--and the service was excellent. Our server, Angel, was wonderful. The place was really empty (we went on a Wednesday around 9:30) which I found odd..and the other parties were a group of British people and a German couple, so obviously they found this place on TA just like I did! But this place isn't a tourist place...it's definitely good food and authentic. One little complaint--they should lower the lighting and also play more unassuming music (they were playing American pop--not exactly romantic to listen to Pink!). The marinated tomatoes were delicious! So was the plate of roasted vegetables with a dipping sauce (can you tell I'm a vegetarian?). My husband eats meat and got some other dishes, but they were hit or miss--some we really loved and some were just so-so. Maybe we didn't order the right dishes. It's over by the Palacio Real, so definitely walkable.

Convenient location to a couple tourist attractions, we were seated in the brick cellar area located in the basement. The waiter spoke good English and gave a little speech on how everything on the menu was so great and the best in Madrid etc. Included in this speech was the 1/4 roasted goat which they must do 1 a night. Anyways, I started to order a few things because I wanted to try a variety and he cut me off. He said ""that is too much, you will waste it, and we don't waste food here... I will only give you 1/2 portions etc"" I was a bit shocked because I feel it's my prerogative to order whatever I wanted. After this extremely awkward interaction, I was allowed to order the foie, fried padron peppers, tomatoes (with arguably the best olive oil I've ever had) and the hake cheeks. About 1/2 way through the meal, I asked the waiter if the goat was still available, and he replied yes. I then asked him to send it to the table and he got right on it. I had to explain I was just joking, but funny how he was going to send over the most expensive item on the menu after his earlier lecture. This place has good food... just be prepared to be rebuffed it you try to order a lot of food.

The family also own the shop next door which supplies the restaurant with Olive Oil but in particular the Jamon - and from the reserved legs in the shop they also supply a lot of the other top Tapas bars in Madrid.

I wasn't entirely sure whether he was trying to up-sell at first but on reflection I think he was just passionate about the local produce. The Squid dish I ordered as a main was a little too salty for my palate and my husband's quarter goatling the same but the Canadian on the next table said his was ""to die for"" and it certainly didn't stop me eating all of mine. The rioja was divine and the olive oil like no other virgin olive oil I've tasted. Tapas (a selection of iberian meats) a little disappointing as a starter but nevertheless tasty.

It has nice decor and good location next to the palace. The house Rioja was good but not sure about the food. I wanted to have only a few tapas and the portions were ridiculously large and you paid for the big sizes so 3 dishes came to around €18. The chorizo was too salty but the Spanish omelette was good. No paras bravas. We had paella and it was ok and the kids shared a steak but came with a not very nice potato dish not fries so we had to order fries on top. I think if you really know what you want you want it's worth a visit but careful choosing and don't go off menu with tapas either take the selection offered or avoid. We visited on a Monday and it was all tourists so suggests there are better restaurants that the Spanish visit nearby so do your research.

The service has been tremendous every single time. The waiters (Alejandro, Salvador) are good at what they do and regularly check in to see if everything is okay. They go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful time. I once visited with a vegetarian friend and even though the menu del día doesn't offer a vegetarian option as a segundo normally they made her a vegetarian risotto (which she loved so much!!). Another time I went with a friend who wanted iced tea (bot not the soda-one) so they brought him a glass with ice and a cup of hot tea, all served with a smile. Besides all that the open kitchen is great, the food is always tremendous and the interior looks beautiful. A few recommendations: - Whenever they have risotto on the menu del día, go for it. It's so, so, so good. All of the different varieties. Just perfect. - Fish!!! The bacalao and tuna at InClan are the most delicious ones I've had in all of Madrid.  And I'll never get enough of the crumbled brownie with ice cream as a dessert. Their menu del día costs only €12,90 which is incredibly cheap for the value you get. The products are of high quality, the service great, the setting lovely.

I felt we were treated fairly badly by the waiting staff, especially when we witnessed how other groups were treated. Discount cards, chupitos and pledges for good reviews on TripAdvisor were dished out aplenty to neighboring tables. We were given watered-down wine (when I highlighted this to the staff, they had to go retrieve more of the wine from the cellar/store room, which confirmed to me that they had only a little left and tried to rob me off with putting some water in it. Just rude) we also had none of the pleasantries indicated above; and we're not difficult people. The food was nice but the evening was completely overshadowed by the fact we were largely ignored and then treated with disdain when we did have dealings with the staff.

The waiter, David, was enthusiastic and extremely knowledgable about the menu and his produce. He brought the steaks out for us to look at before we ordered. I had a sense however of up selling. I wasn't sure he was not trying to get us to buy more expensive dishes. Not sure. I don't think in hindsight it was the right place to take teenagers. The menu was limited for them to choose and this made for a more difficult selection for us all. We found some of the food very salty which may have been our palates but three of us thought it.  The venue in the cellar downstairs was beautiful but lacked atmosphere and had we been a couple alone I would have wanted moving upstairs simply for more company.  I do believe the ingredients were exceptional and the best they can source particularly the olive oil. Wow. And the house wine was fab.  I'm just left in two minds.  I could not fault the service.

My girlfriend stepped in to see if they had some warm broth, as I looked through the front window, I saw him nod with a sense of satisfaction. I immediately walked in with a certain desire to shake that December chill. The decor of this little cozy bar, which has a big dining room in the basement, is rustic and homey. The wooden beams give that country old school feel that makes you want to buck up to the bar and order a winter broth, then a red wine and some tasty tapas. The broth was excellent, not too salty, with a strong beefy taste with a touch of onion, garlic, and bay leaf to warm the stomach and the heart. After the broth, we ordered two house Riojas for 2.20€. Nothing special, but more that adequate.  We asked for the bill, they didn't include the broths. We asked the waiter, and he told us it was on the house. What a nice touch!

The staff from servers to management were warm, welcoming and happy to explain the menu. Alex specifically chatted us up and gave us great recommendations - he is a super host. We tried four plates and a jar of sangria. The pulpo and bao were strong dishes with great presentation and taste. The Q de Pato was the star dish, and I would return just to have this again.  The atmosphere is active and servers were rapidly dropping off plates and drinks for all tables, and hosts routinely checked to see how all were doing. There is definitely a more international feel at Inclan than typical Spanish tapas, and I would describe Inclan as a more modern spin on tapas itself, as well as customer engagement and service.

While in Madrid, we looked for the highest rated restaurant near our hotel - and found this gem just a few blocks away. La Mi Venta is very unassuming from the outside - it looks like a thousand other touristy street cafes in this area near the Palacio Real. But inside is another matter. The ground floor is a very nondescript tapas bar - but downstairs are two very intimate and lovely dining rooms. David, who presides over this area like a king, is assisted by a young man who's name we did not get, but the two compliment each other beautifully.  After being served a delicious bread and an amazing olive oil for dipping, we opted for tapas - two of the combination plates that evening. The menu includes a number of Tapas selections, plus other small plates, salads, and larger meals at the back. Our first Tapas Platter was a combination of Iberico Jamon (reputed to be the best in Madrid - and I have no argument there), and other charcuterie with Manchengo cheese. At David's recommendation, we ordered a bottle of 2010 Pago de Carraovejas Riserva Tinto. A blend of 97% Temperanillo, 2% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 1% Merlot - a truly superlative wine (Parker - 94 Points) for only 44 Euros. The wine was a perfect accompaniment to the Tapas. For our second platter, we chose a seafood base - Pike, tuna, foie gras, and Pork back with fried potatoes and mild chilies. All amazing. The Spanish foie gras (which won the French competition last year) is very light and delicious and the geese are not force-fed to produce this amazing product. We had digestives at the end of the meal, a version of limoncello and a chocolate cream liquor with wonderful confections.  The entire bill with tax was 84 Euros. This restaurant is a don't miss if you are visiting Madrid,",2015-03-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or840-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_17756,0.004,0.783,0.213,0.9979,0.2341441441441441,0.5031081081081081,0.4558,1795,138,0.0768802228412256,1,57,False,59,0.1388888888888889,0.2083333333333333,0.2222222222222222,0.0972222222222222,0.1527777777777778,0.0277777777777777,0.0138888888888888,0.0138888888888888,0.0833333333333333,0.0416666666666666,318,213,4.6415094339622645,0,0,thank tripadvisor com madrid look highest rate restaur near hotel found gem block away la mi venta unassum outsid look like thousand touristi street cafe area near palacio real insid anoth matter ground floor nondescript tapa bar downstair two intim love dine room david presid area like king assist young man name get two compliment beauti serv delici bread amaz oliv oil dip opt tapa two combin plate even menu includ number tapa select plu small plate salad larger meal back first tapa platter combin iberico jamon reput best madrid argument charcuteri manchengo chees david recommend order bottl pago de carraoveja riserva tinto blend temperanillo cabernet sauvignon merlot truli superl wine parker point euro wine perfect accompani tapa second platter chose seafood base pike tuna foie gra pork back fri potato mild chili amaz spanish foie gra french competit last year light delici gees forc fed produc amaz product digest end meal version limoncello chocol cream liquor wonder confect entir bill tax euro restaur miss visit madrid,very good review,5

But be forewarned you will be jammed into the restaurant so tightly that the servers will brush you every time they walk by you. Also, the dining room is set up in an L-shape and the performers play 95% to one direction. Be sure you are at a table in the part of the L closest to the entrance or you will be looking at the performers sides and miss their faces. In addition, we were on the wrong side of the L and there were so many people positioning themselves to see better that we could only see the performers from the waist up. Kind of missing the fact that we missed part of the show which is seeing their legs and feet. Lastly, the meal service we had was so bad they ended up giving us 50% without us asking. That's when you know you're right to be disappointed-- the management could see it. People were being served dessert and we had not even had our entrees. I had to stop a waiter and in my best Spanglish tell him that we had not even been served our dinner. Every step of the way it was stopping them and asking for the next course. My recommendation is that you seek out bars and restaurants that have flamenco as part of their regular service. When we did find it, it was much more from the heart and rich in vitality instead of from a venue that puts the same damn show on 2 times a night almost every night of the year. You will save a ton of money and have a better time.",2013-01-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or310-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17797,0.086,0.766,0.149,0.9767,0.1021325265643447,0.5058422007285643,0.3946538461538462,1504,161,0.1070478723404255,0,27,False,56,0.125,0.0833333333333333,0.1666666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.1041666666666666,0.0625,0.0625,0.125,0.0625,298,178,4.050335570469799,0,0,want dinner theater experi dont mean posit way lot money go forewarn jam restaur tightli server brush everi time walk also dine room set l shape perform play one direct sure tabl part l closest entranc look perform side miss face addit wrong side l mani peopl posit see better could see perform waist kind miss fact miss part show see leg feet lastli meal servic bad end give us without us ask know right disappoint manag could see peopl serv dessert even entre stop waiter best spanglish tell even serv dinner everi step way stop ask next cours recommend seek bar restaur flamenco part regular servic find much heart rich vital instead venu put damn show time night almost everi night year save ton money better time,very bad review,1

So i had 6 of my friends coming over from London for my big 40th birthday celebrations and wanted the weekend to have a Spanish flavour....what better way than to have Flamenco feature in the celebrations. Flamenco at the 'Corral de la Moreria' came highly recommended so i booked 7 tickets for my evening birthday celebrations for show and a drink!  The staff at the venue had saved me the best table for me and my friends which was so special. i was right in front of the stage. I have never seen Flamenco live before and all i can say is that it was awesome. I don't speak any Spanish but the emotion and interplay between the dancers, guitar players and the singers was incredible, it just draws you in. How these amazing stars of Flamenco move their feet so fast is beyond me i was absolutely captivated by their performance and totally in awe. Midway through the show one of the beautiful dancers announced that it was someones birthday........mine. what happened next was totally unexpected. All the dancers, musicians and singers all gathered at the front of the stage and sang happy birthday to me in Spanish flamenco style....truely awesome and unforgettable. it was like stopping a theatre production midway....amazing!! They really made me feel like i was the only one watching the show:-) As they finished singing they brought me out a birthday cake.:-) Then two of the dancers came to our table again and wanted me and my friend to join them on stage to dance Flamenco alongside them.....at first i was hesitant but as there were two of us i felt brave!! How amazing was that. Was i embarrassed up there.... hell no!! All you want to do after watching the show is just try out Flamenco....lolololol. We were dancing alongside these amazing well known performers. Dear 'Corral de la Moreria' all i can say thank you for an incredible evening. My friends and i have pinpointed this evening as one of the highlights of my birthday weekend. How thoughtful you all are, what lovely friendly smiles you gave me as you sang Happy Birthday and thank you for giving me an introduction to Flamenco.....i am now hooked!! If you are reading this and thinking about whether to go to the show or not (as i did before going) dont think about it, just book it!! You'll have an amazing evening:-)xx",2012-08-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or320-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17845,0.028,0.736,0.236,0.9987,0.469214466089466,0.6661243386243385,0.5764227272727273,2315,216,0.093304535637149,11,87,False,57,0.1621621621621621,0.1891891891891892,0.2702702702702703,0.1081081081081081,0.1486486486486486,0.0135135135135135,0.0135135135135135,0.027027027027027,0.0405405405405405,0.027027027027027,409,226,4.6601466992665035,0,0,friday th august friend come london big th birthday celebr want weekend spanish flavour better way flamenco featur celebr flamenco corral de la moreria came highli recommend book ticket even birthday celebr show drink staff venu save best tabl friend special right front stage never seen flamenco live say awesom speak spanish emot interplay dancer guitar player singer incred draw amaz star flamenco move feet fast beyond absolut captiv perform total awe midway show one beauti dancer announc someon birthday mine happen next total unexpect dancer musician singer gather front stage sang happi birthday spanish flamenco style trueli awesom unforgett like stop theatr product midway amaz realli made feel like one watch show finish sing brought birthday cake two dancer came tabl want friend join stage danc flamenco alongsid first hesit two us felt brave amaz embarrass hell want watch show tri flamenco lolololol danc alongsid amaz well known perform dear corral de la moreria say thank incred even friend pinpoint even one highlight birthday weekend thought love friendli smile gave sang happi birthday thank give introduct flamenco hook read think whether go show go dont think book amaz even xx,very good review,5

Food: Good but way overpriced. You have an open menu and you have set menus. The cheapest set menu starts at 40€... the most expensive... forget it! I had a mushroom cream with foie gras and spanish ham. It was quite good. The entrecote steak was cooked to my request. It was juicy and yummy. Dessert was lemon sorbet. This was part of the 40 euro menu. Service was prompt, helpful and friendly. Just perfect. The quality of the food was good and it was very well prepared but at Spanish prices this was way too expensive. But you do not really pay for the food but mostly to be seated there and watch the show. This brings me to the show: You actually purchase the show separately: 42 Euros per person. The show is flamenco dancers, male and female, singer and guitar players. All in all the show was quite good and it had a very good energy. We were sitting near the dancers at table 15, quite a good one. Not too close and not too far. As exciting as it may seem to you, please do not take there kids under 10... both the kids and the rest of the people spending over $ 100 will be thankful. There were two tables right next to me with kids that age and it was seriously unbearable. Kids at 11 PM should be in bed because they are tired, they yell, they complain, they play with their gameboy consoles at full volume (I actually had to ask the mother to shut the thing up) All in all, I think it is something I would recommend for someone visiting our country if they do not have time to head down to Andalucia.

We are staying in the Atocha area, so the walk was less than a mile and a pleasant walk at that. Was surprised and excited to see how vibrant the city was at 9 pm. My partner and I walked in and was put on a wait list, note that the space is not small it is tiny and extremely narrow. After about 20 minutes a space opened up at the bar and we decided to take full advantage. We started with a pint of the most delicious sangria that I have ever had, seriously good. We opted to order a few tapas, a full portion of the tempura salmon. At the end, we had to decided to order another portion of the garlic shrimp and some spinach quiche. The food was fresh and did not lack in flavor, we were literally speechless by what we had just experienced. The guy at the bar spoke zero English but he was so polite and we managed with my minimal butchered version of Spanish. Will definitely dine here again if given the chance. I held off on a full five rating due to the space and the wait, otherwise no complaints.

Let us count them... - When the hearing server was offered our phone translator app to communicate with us, he said he would get someone who speaks English. As if that would be more helpful? Before that, he actually read my question and then turned to the other person and began, ""So he asked this and the answer is..."" -- which we can only interpret as an indication that he thinks Deaf people are inferior customers. - The other server very stubbornly kept speaking to answer our questions until we had to explicitly gesture for his mouth to stop and his fingers to start typing. - This new server did not know the menu and had to ask the kitchen several times. Our questions were very basic - what is in the risotto? What does this particular name mean? Etc. - Although water is not automatically served in most restaurants, we were not even offered the option and thus went without it for our entire meal. - The first server brought our salads and again continued to ignore the communication needs that had been expressed, instead verbally announcing which dishes were which. - Our starters and mains were served together, which we didn't expect and weren't asked if we would prefer them served in sequence. We were used to other European restaurants so it's possible this is how they do it, but we simply weren't warned. - The shrimp main dish was a questionable creation to be priced at €5,20 because it essentially was four small shrimp served in a cast iron plate of oil. It did not taste bad, but it most certainly did not belong at a price point anywhere above €2. - When we sent the shrimp dish back and informed them we would order another main, we ended up never getting a new menu to do this. Eventually I had to get up and take one from the server station myself, and saw that two other servers were idle in another section of the restaurant. (We ended up not ordering anything else as we were too frustrated and disappointed with the portion sizes of other dishes described to us.) - When our last dishes were taken away, we weren't told we had to go to the bar to pay, and since it wasn't visible from our section, we had no visual clues until we actually got up in frustration after 15 minutes and discovered how to pay.  - The shrimp dish was still on the first bill given to us. They did remove it, but at this point: honestly? Really? Don't go here. We are sorry to the owners who probably work hard to stay afloat in the business, but they simply need to get the basic issues addressed ASAP. Staff training and a redesigned menu are the best place to start.",2016-09-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396325-Reviews-or1290-Taberna_Mas_Al_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_17872,0.067,0.887,0.046,-0.6979,-0.0051522059500782,0.3906696140738695,0.3704416666666666,2629,237,0.0901483453784709,0,73,False,77,0.1,0.05,0.2,0.05,0.15,0.0833333333333333,0.05,0.0666666666666666,0.1833333333333333,0.0666666666666666,485,277,4.420618556701031,0,0,restaur mani thing wrong let us count hear server offer phone translat app commun us said would get someon speak english would help actual read question turn person began ask answer interpret indic think deaf peopl inferior custom server stubbornli kept speak answer question explicitli gestur mouth stop finger start type new server know menu ask kitchen sever time question basic risotto particular name mean etc although water automat serv restaur even offer option thu went without entir meal first server brought salad continu ignor commun need express instead verbal announc dish starter main serv togeth expect ask would prefer serv sequenc use european restaur possibl simpli warn shrimp main dish question creation price essenti four small shrimp serv cast iron plate oil tast bad certainli belong price point anywher sent shrimp dish back inform would order anoth main end never get new menu eventu get take one server station saw two server idl anoth section restaur end order anyth els frustrat disappoint portion size dish describ us last dish taken away told go bar pay sinc visibl section visual clue actual got frustrat minut discov pay shrimp dish still first bill given us remov point honestli realli go sorri owner probabl work hard stay afloat busi simpli need get basic issu address asap staff train redesign menu best place start,very bad review,1

We definitely wanted to see a flamenco show, but we are generally not fans of the typical touristy destinations. We were also debating whether to eat there or just go for the show and drinks. For the sake of ease, we opted to eat dinner at the show. The food was quite good. Not spectacular and probably a bit over priced, but all in all, very good. The service was first rate. Our waiter happily substituted sangria instead of wine for my daughters at no charge. As for the show, we didn't have anything to compare it to, never having seen a Flamenco show, but all 4 of us thought it was terrific. The intensity and skill of the dancers was quite entertaining As other's have said, it is not an inexpensive evening, but in our view it was well worth it.

We arrived about 10:45 and lined up for what turned out to be the 11:30pm show. At the door it became obvious almost everyone else had a booking but we got lucky and were fitted in towards the back but raised up a step so the view was good. The actual venue looks tired but once seated it doesn't matter since it's dark. The crowd seems to be split between tourists and local aficionados, who were good at shssing the disrespectful. We didn't eat and only bought an extra bottle of water and one beer, the total was 102 euros. I am a neophyte at flamenco so have no idea whether the performances constituted ""good"" or even great flamenco but the singers poured out emotion, the guitar players sizzled and the feet action of the dancers was tiring to watch, I can only speculate how it must hurt to perform at that intensity and duration.

However, the 75 minutes of hiq show have simply flown away, leaving but goose bumps all over my skin and even tears every now and then.

My wife and I have promised ourselves a Flamenco evening for many a year...and our first visit to Madrid provided the perfect opportunity. After much internet research and local advice, we settled on Corral de la Moreria. We knew it was not going to be cheap, so were not shocked at the 100 Euro per head cost of the meal with a show. The meal was extremely good, and the wine that is served with each fixed menu is a perfect match. The service was outstanding...a special mention to Diego, our dedicated waiter for the evening...a true star..! As the desserts are served, so the dancing starts. There is not enough space here to list all of the superlatives that could be used to describe the show...suffice to say, it was truly breathtaking. The energy and soul of the dancers, both male and female, could be sensed in the room. Mesmerizing.

I am not entirely sure of this; the place is really small and, together with a crowded attendance, this means only a very small stage (with few performers) and packed tables. I have seen much better, from this point of view, even in Madrid itself. However, I cannot find fault at all with the quality of the show and its intensity, which were amazing. The real surprise was with the food, which was gorgeous; the chef in the kitchen knows what he's doing. You are probably going to end up asking for one of the fixed menus (this is also a way to speed up the service to times compatible with the live performance); this means not very much choice of dishes, but everything we tried was delicious. I was particularly impressed by the mushroom soup, with a unique bitter flavour, by the sea bass and by the lamb. The wine (you are entitled to half a bottle per person, or more in the gourmet menu) was also excellent. A sad note was the price, definitely inflated, even for such a great experience.

Others reviews were on mark as my wife and I had a delicious dinner her after a long and wonderful day of exploring Madrid. Our servers, William and Henry were very helpful to couple of Americans who could navigate the language with much difficulty. In spite of our challenges they both made us feel at home this evening and served us a wonderful dinner with some recommended local specialties. The shaved beef on homemade chips and the seasoned pork loin on potatoes with delicious reduction on top were excellent. Before this we tried their Cesar salad and although the dressing was not the typical Cesar dressing we get in the US, it was very good and the salad components were all fresh. All was accompanied by some delicious wine selections that Henry recommended for our meal. To top all this off, William offered us a shot of Doramas Arehucas, a tasty honey like liqueur as desert. I highly recommend this restaurant to others visiting this area of Madrid. A gem of a find.

Surprisingly, given that they accommodate about 200 plus people per show, the performers, food and service were very good. My main complaint stems from the fact that the staff is so busy serving customers and collecting payment during the show that they are constantly blocking the view of the stage. Again, the staff is delightful but the venue is such that they block the view of the flamenco show. In most instances this would be acceptable but, when you are paying more than $200 per couple, it is fair to expect more. Additionally, while we were there, many in the audience were carrying on loud conversations and telephone calls. I understand that Corral De Moreria cannot be held responsible for their patrons' lack of manners however, it seems to me that some effort should be made to ask customers who are engaged in loud conversations during the show to either hang up their phones or conduct their conversations elsewhere so as not to disrupt performers nor the audience. So, to recap, the food was very good, the quality of the performers was excellent but the venue left a lot to be desired",2013-04-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or290-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17953,0.053,0.824,0.124,0.9524,0.3793333333333333,0.5513333333333333,0.5845428571428571,1215,108,0.0888888888888888,0,23,False,21,0.1509433962264151,0.1320754716981132,0.2641509433962264,0.0566037735849056,0.3018867924528302,0.0188679245283018,0.0,0.0,0.0754716981132075,0.0,213,140,4.708920187793427,0,0,recent madrid wife lover flamenco follow ta review corral de moreria surprisingli given accommod plu peopl per show perform food servic good main complaint stem fact staff busi serv custom collect payment show constantli block view stage staff delight venu block view flamenco show instanc would accept pay per coupl fair expect addit mani audienc carri loud convers telephon call understand corral de moreria cannot held respons patron lack manner howev seem effort made ask custom engag loud convers show either hang phone conduct convers elsewher disrupt perform audienc recap food good qualiti perform excel venu left lot desir,average review,3

It is expensive but was supposed to be worth the extra euros. Unfortunately, that was not really the case. The brilliant part is the actual performance. It was very, very good and the energy was just amazing. The performers were obviously very accomplished and their virtuosity was unbelievable. It was my first Flamenco performance in Spain and I was bowled over.  Everything else in the restaurant was a bit of a let down. Firstly, it is a super cramped place. Small chairs that give you barely enough place to sit comfortably. There are just too many diners packed in like sardines. It was a packed evening and the service was bad all the way. Whether it was the time taken between the different courses or having to remind someone to bring the olive oil, there seemed to be too few servers for the packed place. And then there is the angle from which the majority of guests have to view the dance - from pillars blocking the view to craning your neck to see the performance, it was just not the right viewing angle. Some of the tables have a direct, theatre-style view. But all others have a lateral view that is anything but optimal. Lastly, there is too much of disturbance during the performance, with servers floating around, people talking to each other, sounds of cutlery etc etc.  The restaurant itself is quite quaint and old. The food is quite good. It is a pity that the excellent performance gets diluted by other factors.",2015-11-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or170-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_17968,0.051,0.785,0.164,0.9913,0.119796626984127,0.4988417658730158,0.42433,1589,152,0.0956576463184392,0,33,False,46,0.0769230769230769,0.173076923076923,0.2307692307692307,0.0769230769230769,0.1538461538461538,0.0384615384615384,0.0192307692307692,0.0576923076923076,0.0961538461538461,0.0769230769230769,286,173,4.5524475524475525,0,0,busi trip madrid went see flamenco corral de la moreria heard lot place entir experi expens suppos worth extra euro unfortun realli case brilliant part actual perform good energi amaz perform obvious accomplish virtuos unbeliev first flamenco perform spain bowl everyth els restaur bit let firstli super cramp place small chair give bare enough place sit comfort mani diner pack like sardin pack even servic bad way whether time taken differ cours remind someon bring oliv oil seem server pack place angl major guest view danc pillar block view crane neck see perform right view angl tabl direct theatr style view other later view anyth optim lastli much disturb perform server float around peopl talk sound cutleri etc etc restaur quit quaint old food quit good piti excel perform get dilut factor,bad review,2

A quick TA search revealed La Mi Venta was highly regarded and very close so off we went. Centrally situated a stones throw from the Royal Palace with dining on the pavement inside the bar area and what looks like a very nice cellar. Staff were very attentive and tried hard to accomodate our poor Spanish by bringing out an English menu. We ordered a small selection of Tapa. That was, Cecina de Leon (cured beef), toasted bread with tomatoes, oil and garlic, Pisto Manchego (vegetable stew) from the extensive menu. However, we ordered a gin and tonic and a beer prior to this without realising that this triggers the supply of a couple of ""pincho's"" which I had noticed on the bar. Pincho's being small Tapa usually served on a disc of bread, two discs per drink per person. Our original food order was meant to be a start point but as we also had more drinks we soon were sated. We had five drinks but got three double portions of pincho's.  The main dishes were excellent and in particular the cured beef from Leon was the star, a new delight for me, I have had Bresceola in Aus but like the difference one may discover between Italian and Spanish hams so it seems with the air dried beef. Served with Padron Peppers and fried potatoes it was tops. The vegetable stew was as if made in a rustic kitchen and also a good eat and tomato bread is rarely a disappointment anywhere. The Gin and Tonic's were served in a small goldfish bowl and I don't think it would be advisable to drive after just one, house red was very pleasant. Hard to see us not going back for a second go.

At the large table directly behind us there was an extremely loud drunk blonde lady who was very obnoxious because of her volume. Across from her another lady became sick prior to the show and had to go out. She almost fainted on her way and had to sit down in a chair until one of the men in her group could escort her outside. She never returned. So it was not the best start for our evening. The view of the stage from our table was partially blocked by a pillar but not bad compared to several other tables. The dinner was surprisingly good. My wife had the rack of lamb with pumpkin puree and rustic potatoes while I had sea bass. For dessert my wife had a pear in wine with coffee cream while I had Crème Brule. While the food was really very good I thought that given the relatively high prices paid for the show that the food prices were exhorbitant. But the experience shouldn't be missed.   The show was very good; more skillful, artistic, and expressive than the Flamenco show we had seen in Seville. There were two dancers, three singers, and two guitar players. It was all very exciting and we enjoyed our evening a lot. The dinner reservations had been for 7:30 pm with the early show beginning at 8:30 pm and ending about 9:40 pm. I would say this experience is a must if you are going to Spain. We were told by natives that these shows are too touristy and that we should look for small shows with fewer performers in Flamenco bars but we were very satisfied with our experience.",2015-11-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or170-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_18005,0.034,0.859,0.107,0.9832,0.1705592757936508,0.518718998015873,0.4202823529411765,1582,155,0.0979772439949431,0,27,False,51,0.1212121212121212,0.1363636363636363,0.2272727272727272,0.0909090909090909,0.1969696969696969,0.0303030303030303,0.0454545454545454,0.0151515151515151,0.0757575757575757,0.0606060606060606,296,184,4.341216216216216,0,0,place crowd sever larg tour group make hard talk larg tabl directli behind us extrem loud drunk blond ladi obnoxi volum across anoth ladi becam sick prior show go almost faint way sit chair one men group could escort outsid never return best start even view stage tabl partial block pillar bad compar sever tabl dinner surprisingli good wife rack lamb pumpkin pure rustic potato sea bass dessert wife pear wine coffe cream cr brule food realli good thought given rel high price paid show food price exhorbit experi miss show good skill artist express flamenco show seen sevil two dancer three singer two guitar player excit enjoy even lot dinner reserv pm earli show begin pm end pm would say experi must go spain told nativ show touristi look small show fewer perform flamenco bar satisfi experi,very good review,5

We went to El Corral as it was highly rated on trip advisor...although we were pre-warned that it was expensive. We could not have been more disappointed!! Our first recommendation is to NEVER go to a flamenco show that has dinner included. There is too much""noise"" occurring during the performance to enjoy it. The audience is disrespectful to the performers as they talk while the show is going on...also the waiters are running back and forth with plates and settling bills before the show is even concluded. This venue is just too large to appreciate a good show. That being said, this was not even a good flamenco. Comparing to what we saw in Seville where the artists are really into the music and do not even notice the audience and the audience gives the artists their undivided attention, these performers were more into the audience and pleasing them and looking for gratification. They were constantly looking at each other and not engrossing themselves in the music as we have seen previously. There was much less dancing than we were used to and there was much more singing...the dancers seemed to be much more interested in working their shawls than in working their feet. We know they rotate the performers and maybe we were there on a bad night...and maybe this place gets high reviews because it is the first place that someone sees flamenco, but it was well below what we have come to expect. As an aside, the food was good but very overpriced...and with one final note, this is a heavily touristed show, so it was surprising that the only long introduction given was entirely in Spanish, with no English translation. Pretty much all the people around us were non Spanish speaking and had no idea of what was said. In Seville, where English is spoken far less, even the smallest flamenco clubs would have someone who gave an English interpretation. We are going to another flamenco club tonight, which hopefully will restore our passion for this wondrous art form...",2015-11-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or170-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_18006,0.028,0.878,0.094,0.9748,0.128051948051948,0.4375054112554112,0.5691133333333334,2188,202,0.0923217550274223,2,48,False,64,0.1382978723404255,0.1063829787234042,0.2127659574468085,0.0957446808510638,0.1702127659574468,0.0425531914893617,0.0638297872340425,0.0212765957446808,0.0638297872340425,0.0851063829787234,382,216,4.730366492146596,0,0,attend flamenco show differ club sevil week excit see flamenco madrid heard best perform head larger scale went el corral highli rate trip advisor although pre warn expens could disappoint first recommend never go flamenco show dinner includ much nois occur perform enjoy audienc disrespect perform talk show go also waiter run back forth plate settl bill show even conclud venu larg appreci good show said even good flamenco compar saw sevil artist realli music even notic audienc audienc give artist undivid attent perform audienc pleas look gratif constantli look engross music seen previous much less danc use much sing dancer seem much interest work shawl work feet know rotat perform mayb bad night mayb place get high review first place someon see flamenco well come expect asid food good overpr one final note heavili tourist show surpris long introduct given entir spanish english translat pretti much peopl around us non spanish speak idea said sevil english spoken far less even smallest flamenco club would someon gave english interpret go anoth flamenco club tonight hope restor passion wondrou art form,bad review,2
