The food was fresh and packed with local flavors. For us it was a long cab ride form our hotel but it was worth it. When we arrived our host Cesar said we needed to share, which we thought meant as a couple we needed to share. No, no...for Cesar it meant we need to order 1/2 portions and taste all the selections family style. If we ordered full portion we could have feed two more couples with our two first and second courses. Our 1/2 portions arrived paced, one after we finished another. Each was fresh and filled with local flavor. We had a salad with cheese shavings, bacon and an aged balsamic vinegar on top. It was so good we neglected to put on oil and vinegar which was provided. We had a soup made from a local vegetable I could not pronounce either the English or Spanish versions. For our entries we had a special Iberia pork cut topped with caramelized onions and brie, and a simple dish of monk fish topped with olive oil, lemon juice, roasted garlic and red pepper bits. Everything was fresh. The best part was it was very affordable. Even with the cab fare it was less than other restaurants we visited of similar quality. When we arrived we were at first concerned because the front was just a bar, and we were lead to a very small restaurant area in the back where no one was seated. We spoke only English and all the staff tried their best to welcome us, which quickly overcame any concerns we had. We arrived at 8:30PM on a Saturday night and there were two tables with guests; by 9:30PM ALL the tables were full !! Alcaravea was filled with very happy local patrons, and one very happy tourist customer. We were lucky we made reservations because we would have missed the wonderful food, and most important the friendly staff and Cesar.",2013-02-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2403049-Reviews-or70-Alcaravea-Madrid.html,UID_10320,0.033,0.786,0.181,0.9961,0.2984226190476191,0.4386719576719577,0.30094,1805,160,0.0886426592797784,2,40,False,78,0.1323529411764706,0.1617647058823529,0.3235294117647059,0.0588235294117647,0.1764705882352941,0.0147058823529411,0.0294117647058823,0.0147058823529411,0.0588235294117647,0.0294117647058823,336,198,4.375,0,0,great find trip madrid food fresh pack local flavor us long cab ride form hotel worth arriv host cesar said need share thought meant coupl need share cesar meant need order portion tast select famili style order full portion could feed two coupl two first second cours portion arriv pace one finish anoth fresh fill local flavor salad chees shave bacon age balsam vinegar top good neglect put oil vinegar provid soup made local veget could pronounc either english spanish version entri special iberia pork cut top caramel onion brie simpl dish monk fish top oliv oil lemon juic roast garlic red pepper bit everyth fresh best part afford even cab fare less restaur visit similar qualiti arriv first concern front bar lead small restaur area back one seat spoke english staff tri best welcom us quickli overcam concern arriv pm saturday night two tabl guest pm tabl full alcaravea fill happi local patron one happi tourist custom lucki made reserv would miss wonder food import friendli staff cesar,good review,4

I have the menu del dia with a fabada asturiana (Spanish bean stew) as the first course. Second course a small leg of lamb roasted asturiana style with potato's followed by an excellent dessert. This all comes with wine, bottled water and bread. This to me was an excellent meal. The portions are so big that I am sure you will not be able to eat all of it. And one thing I notice is the place is full of Spanish enjoying their lunches. And also the price is inexpensively low. Of course I do not know that we received such an excellent service is because my companion is,well known to the restaurant. I did returned with my companion 2 days later and the same high standard is bestowed upon us. This time I have a rice with shellfish as a first course and a cocido madrileno and again big portions.

All of the staff speak good English and make ordering very easy. We ordered 2 starters and two 1/2 portion mains which was too much food still. We had four glasses of wine, one expresso and two after dinner shots bill was 60 euro. Great price for value of meal. A couple should consider 2 starters and one 1/2 portion main. That will be a lot of food.  We had burrata mozzarella as one of our starters exceptional. We had two units of the zucchini flowerette with some kind of reduced vinaigrette. It was splendid.  We had a half portion of beef cheek stew which was similar to braised beef rib. Flavor was terrific meat very tender. Meat was served with small shoestring potatoes and reduced veggies from stew, meal came on a plate. The other main we had was a pork steak cut into small strips which they recommended be cooked on the rare side.

In a non-descript suburb of the city and nothing to look at from the outside, but the food was great. We got there early, before they were actually officially open, but they welcomed us and gave us beers and tapas. We are not talking about the basic cheap stuff you get in bars - this was cooked in their kitchen, and the servings huge. We had to hold back from eating more as we didn't want to spoil our lunch! The highlight of the meal was the pork shoulder. Cooked to perfection, flavoursome, and a generous serving. Cesar the owner was helpful with advice on the menu, warning us not to over-order. We had a beautiful local organic red wine with the meal, and although we asked for a light wine, it was 15%! My wife liked the Russian Salad from the tapas so much she had more with her meal, and they had no problem serving that to her at no extra charge. The restaurant and service has a homely down to earth feel to it, and this allied to the great food meant that the place was packed after a very short time. We were the only tourists as far as we could see, and Cesar was interested to know how we found out about the place. When we said it was TA he said he was really embarrassed by the restaurant's very high rating, as he sees himself as a down to earth guy running a small local restaurant that is nothing that special, and the international exposure makes him a little uneasy as it might raise expectations unduly. He has nothing to worry about...the service was great and friendly, the food excellent, and the prices very reasonable. If you are ever in Madrid, it is well worth a visit.

It's in a beautiful neighborhood, ""Geronimos"", next to the Retiro, on a quiet street. We booked for 8:30 PM and we were the first people there. Eventually, the place filled up, so remember, Spaniards don't eat early. The chef comes out to explain the menus--if you're a Spanish Speaker. If you speak English, then your waiter gets the job. The chef is funny and engaging--if you understand what he's saying. The menus is all about the entrees. That's kind of weird. The chef explained the salads and appetizers--they're not on the menu. When we first sat down, we were contemplating how we were going to spend 35 Euros for both an entree sized appetizer and an equally priced entree. The chef's visit cleared up the confusion. We split a special salad with Serrano ham and fresh cheese. My wife had Iberico pork loin and I had squab for dinner. We split a gorgeous coconut panna cotta for dessert. Dinner came to 180 euros, but bear in ind that I ordered a 60 euro bottle of wine and we had two glasses of Albarino to start off the meal. So, while this wasn't cheap, it wasn't abusive either.

We expected and got Spanish cooking at its best. Highlights were the roast squab which had been substituted for the poulet de bresse that evening and the grilled shrimp with ajoblanco. Given confidence by the quality of the materials, on the second visit I chose the “presa iberica” which turned out to be a seared pinkish fillet of sucking pig. One does not eat pink pork but I risked it; it was delicious and I am still in good health!  On the third visit we were entertaining guests including one from Thailand. And then came the unexpected. Among the ‘specials’ was a ‘sashimi ceviche’ – or that’s what I think the waiter said – which was acclaimed as brilliant by my guest. Not what you expect from a small local restaurant in Spain!   The Viridiana is idiosyncratic. The starters on the menu tend to be as large portions as the mains and priced accordingly. But the real starters, as well as several mains, are specials of the day described verbally and including for example two salads and some delicious croquettes of guinea fowl and ham. Extra unordered plates appear without warning or apparent charge, most notably lentil soup served with a prawn on one occasion and a meatball on another.  Service is charming and the large and ebullient chef/patron very present to supervise at least one of his family. However on the evening with guests our conversation was never interrupted unnecessarily by the staff as it so often is elsewhere.

I'm a celiac and must say that really it's hard to find a place that would serve a gluten free pizza that taste good. I got the marguarita pizza which was thin and crispy with freshly cut mozzarella cheese (not this industrial cheese) and tasty tomato base. For appetizer we ordered the burrata with no bread just the sun-dried tomato and touch of truffle which was off the chart. My friend order fresh gluten free pasta with clasic ragu sauce and it taste great and portion was extra large which at the end we felt like we had eaten a lot.

It's the perfect place to take your significant other, whether it's a first time or whenever. You could say it's also magical from the first time you see it. We've never seen a restaurant so thematically designed for romance and a homage to film, specifically Luis Bunuel, a very famous film director.  It's location is in a very charming neighborhood where you can walk before or after dining. It's located in a neighborhood right on the edge of Retiro Park. Your first impression from the street and sidewalk already hints at the romanticism you are about to experience. One can be seated outside or inside. Inside, there are several levels, and we had a table on the street level, near the front windows. Everything from the seating, table setting, wall decor, chairs encapsulates the restaurant theme. I have to say that we've never seen anything quite like it (that's a compliment).  Once we absorbed all the ambience, we settled down and ordered off the menu. We were presently surprised that (like others) we were given a complimentary appetizer to start (stuffed mushroom). Of course, we had some champagne to start. Then, we shared a side of croquettes. This was not very appetizing, being for us either too mushy and very little taste. Not too mention, the order was just too much.  The main entrees were much better.

First of all I need to say that I can not fault the food!!!! The food was delicious, the desserts where not to my liking but that does not mean that they were not good. Just not the taste that I prefer. The service was excellent and all the waiters were very polite and professional. I wish I could do a separate review for the Chef/owner, and give a good review to everything else. We knew that the chef was going out to welcome the clients and explain the menu. We saw him going to every table and do so,and when it was our turn,he came to our table,and when we said ''Hi Chef '' instead of Hola...he took this face of contempt,moved his hand in a not very polite way and said ''English?? My colleague speaks...'' That was it. He went to every table 2-3 times, and every time he passed by ours, he avoided eye contact. Two of the waiters were speaking decent English.He could have somebody to translate 2 words as a welcome.Even just a smile would be enough for a couple that paid 145 Euros in his restaurant. Instead, we felt like we had the plague or something.... The receptionist back at the hotel said,Don't mind him, he is ''special''.Well,I believe the clients that pay him and honor him every day are special. The restaurant works for the clients,if not...any chef can stay at home and cook for himself.  Again I say though, that the food was very good.My wife had a fantastic tuna and I had the Galician cow with black truffle.

We chose the large tasting menu, and we understand that it changes from day to day. What really impressed us was, that most of the courses were Spanish classics, that we have had many times before, but it was just so much better, than we have ever had it before.  The servants are young and inexperienced, but it is not a big problem since the chef himself spends a lot if time in the restaurant overseeing everything and interacts with the costumers to inform about the food and the wines.

It is always good to have dinner at a place where the owner/chef is very active.  There are starters that are served with your mains, so from the olives and breads, all the way to the final desserts, you will enjoy every aspect of your meal.

It was our finest restaurant meal on a 21/2 month trip. The chef/ owner had an eagle eye over the 2 story, beautifully decorated restaurant. These days, it is hard to find the perfect blend of gourmet food, with extras from the kitchen, local products and preparations, friendly service and fine wines. We sat in the upper level, wonderfully decorated with tables far apart that you have the feeling of privacy. The menu has intricate preparations and we appreciated our waitress who helped us interpret the menu. You can’t go wrong - it’s just deciding that is difficult. We started with a squash soup - a gift from the kitchen - followed by herring that was incredibly tender and came with shots of vodka ( a real treat and hard to find in this region) - we then had roast suckling pig with side dishes - the portion was large and we were happy that we had decided to share it. Too full for dessert , we ordered coffee but another gift from the kitchen of sorbet came- chocolates with the coffee and another gift of after dinner liqueur. It was truly exceptional . The wine was perfect as well.

Lunch time was a little busy filled with a mix of tourists and locals. Everyone seemed to be getting a prefix meal, which seemed to be the best and highest value option. We opted to go in a different route. I was craving fatty bar food. As a result I ordered the french fries covered in fried eggs and Spanish ham. I thought it was great. The greasy hangover food was just what I needed. My wife ordered some croquets or something that was fried. She ate it all so I would assume she liked it as well.

One of my favorite dining experiences in Madrid - everything we had , from the amuse bouche to the coffee and truffles were outstanding and perfect in every way. Also, the Bellinis are the best anywhere! The chef is gracious enough to come and welcome each guest and explain the menu and the specials. A real pleasure to dine in an establishment like this which is full of the great Spanish tradition of taking food seriously. At the same time, I would like to address some of the critisim in previous reviews, especially from English -speaking visitors. Yes, the bread and oil are not free and are part of the cover charge, which is practiced in most restaurants in Spain. It is not 5 eur per person but 2.50 per person and the bread and oil are of the highest quality, one which is rare to find in the US. Also, there is a special house bread, created by the chef, which is served to all the clients and its a wonderfully delicious treat along with several amuse bouches which are not part of the menu but which are served to every customer for free. And while bottled water is expensive everywhere in the world (a bottle of Evian can easily run you $8-10 in NY), the wine is incredibly reasonable in Spain. Also, nobody adds a 20% tip charge to your bill since service is not included in Spain and is left at your own discretion. Finally, the chef and owner does not speak English but since when did that become a requirement for great chefs? When you come to Per Se in NY, does Thomas Keller come out and explain each dish to every international customer in his or her own native language? Viridiana is an expensive restaurant - that is true - but the quality of the ingredients, the product and the preparation are exceptional and merit the price. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough to anyone visiting Madrid, who would like to have a truly memorable experience and who appreciates fine cuisine prepared by a great talent like Mr. Garcia.",2011-08-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or250-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_19303,0.013,0.75,0.238,0.9985,0.3297077922077921,0.6349567099567099,0.4065,2163,188,0.0869163199260286,1,43,False,75,0.0909090909090909,0.1931818181818181,0.3636363636363636,0.0681818181818181,0.1931818181818181,0.0113636363636363,0.0113636363636363,0.0227272727272727,0.034090909090909,0.0113636363636363,390,219,4.5487179487179485,0,0,truli extraordinari restaur led marvel chef creat memor dish creativ eleg indic cusin cultur great countri like spain one favorit dine experi madrid everyth amus bouch coffe truffl outstand perfect everi way also bellini best anywher chef graciou enough come welcom guest explain menu special real pleasur dine establish like full great spanish tradit take food serious time would like address critisim previou review especi english speak visitor ye bread oil free part cover charg practic restaur spain eur per person per person bread oil highest qualiti one rare find us also special hous bread creat chef serv client wonder delici treat along sever amus bouch part menu serv everi custom free bottl water expens everywher world bottl evian easili run ny wine incred reason spain also nobodi add tip charg bill sinc servic includ spain left discret final chef owner speak english sinc becom requir great chef come per se ny thoma keller come explain dish everi intern custom nativ languag viridiana expens restaur true qualiti ingredi product prepar except merit price cannot recommend restaur enough anyon visit madrid would like truli memor experi appreci fine cuisin prepar great talent like mr garcia,bad review,2

While the staff had limited Englis,h we were made very welcome and managed to communicate effectively using our limited Spanish. The chef/patron explained the days special dishes, one of which was chosen to good effect. Other reviewers’ comments are difficult to understand. This is a top end boutique restaurant for people who like good food and can afford to pay for it. It is aimed at a local Madrilieno clientele and not at tourists. There is no reason why they should be able to speak English, when that is not their intended market. Cover charges are commonplace throughout Europe, one is not just paying for bread!

We arrived about 820, early by Madrid standards, so the restaurant was more or less empty and we were seated immediately. The waiter advised us that the kitchen didn't open until 830 so there would be no hot food before that point Some mortadella-style meat with a mustardy sauce was placed on the table but no bread/ breadsticks (although we were charged a cover charge for both) and eventually someone took our drinks and food order. Two of us ordered glasses of Moet rose - the waiter came back with a bottle of rose wine, I clarified we are after the champagne, so off he headed again to look for it. The starters arrived with still no evidence of the champagne and the waiter finally turned up to say they had none in stock and that an Italian sparkling would be just as nice - we accepted and it then took another five minutes before that turned up. The menu is very long with three categories of pasta in lots of different shapes and plenty of pizza choices. One of us had penne arrabbiata which looked and tasted as if it had come out of a supermarket jar, while my seafood linguine could best be described as industrial. At no point did any of the staff come back to refill our water glasses (the bottle was not left on the table and we did not see it again) nor ask if we wanted more drinks but given how long it took the first lot to arrive, that may have been a blessing. To add insult to injury, i had to ask for the bill FOUR times before we could beat a hasty retreat. FYI the cost was 100 euros for two bruschette, one caprese salad, one caesar salad, the two bowls of pasta, three glasses of wine and a bottle of water - so while not expensive, it was not cheap either.",2017-06-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7895442-Reviews-or140-Flavia_Restaurant_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_34873,0.062,0.851,0.087,0.9074,0.1704611330698287,0.4876284584980236,0.6795111111111112,1786,163,0.0912653975363941,0,35,False,76,0.1621621621621621,0.1081081081081081,0.1351351351351351,0.054054054054054,0.1621621621621621,0.081081081081081,0.054054054054054,0.027027027027027,0.1621621621621621,0.054054054054054,338,205,4.28698224852071,0,0,visit restaur tuesday even persuad foolish posit review ta arriv earli madrid standard restaur less empti seat immedi waiter advis us kitchen open would hot food point mortadella style meat mustardi sauc place tabl bread breadstick although charg cover charg eventu someon took drink food order two us order glass moet rose waiter came back bottl rose wine clarifi champagn head look starter arriv still evid champagn waiter final turn say none stock italian sparkl would nice accept took anoth five minut turn menu long three categori pasta lot differ shape plenti pizza choic one us penn arrabbiata look tast come supermarket jar seafood linguin could best describ industri point staff come back refil water glass bottl left tabl see ask want drink given long took first lot arriv may bless add insult injuri ask bill four time could beat hasti retreat fyi cost euro two bruschett one capres salad one caesar salad two bowl pasta three glass wine bottl water expens cheap either,bad review,2

Entrees are all in the 30 something euro range, but the apps are about the same price as the entrees, which seems high. And the portions are appetizer size in case you thought they might be large. So instead of paying 25-30 euros for each starter, I asked the waiter if he could just make me a plain green salad with tomatoes. I just wanted some greens with my main dish, since it was all meat and carbs. He said no problem, and also picked a nice red wine for us. Like other reviewers mentioned, they bring you a couple ""complimentary"" starters, which consisted of a strawberry gazpacho and a plate of antipasti. All in all I was pretty happy with the food (we ordered the bulltail and guinea fowl). When the check came, there were a few shockers. He charged us 25 euros for 1 salad (which is outrageous since it was iceberg lettuce and a few cherry tomatoes), 5 euros for a bottle of water, and 5 euros per person for bread (we each had 1 roll!). At least he didn't choose a ridiculously expensive bottle of wine. In retrospect, I should have complained, but I felt guilty after the free starters (although everyone gets that). After some time to think about the experience, I feel cheated. The restaurant still found a way to get paid for those free starters by charging exorbitant amounts for all those trivial things that you would never expect to cost much. Thus, the bad taste in my mouth. We ended up spending 140 euros for 1 salad, 2 entrees, and 1 bottle of wine.",2010-06-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or260-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_34878,0.084,0.81,0.106,0.873,-0.0230128205128205,0.4868864468864468,0.4269875,1546,132,0.0853816300129366,1,47,False,67,0.1219512195121951,0.1219512195121951,0.1951219512195122,0.073170731707317,0.1463414634146341,0.048780487804878,0.024390243902439,0.073170731707317,0.0975609756097561,0.0975609756097561,285,190,4.428070175438597,0,0,mix review place first price strang entre someth euro rang app price entre seem high portion appet size case thought might larg instead pay euro starter ask waiter could make plain green salad tomato want green main dish sinc meat carb said problem also pick nice red wine us like review mention bring coupl complimentari starter consist strawberri gazpacho plate antipasti pretti happi food order bulltail guinea fowl check came shocker charg us euro salad outrag sinc iceberg lettuc cherri tomato euro bottl water euro per person bread roll least choos ridicul expens bottl wine retrospect complain felt guilti free starter although everyon get time think experi feel cheat restaur still found way get paid free starter charg exorbit amount trivial thing would never expect cost much thu bad tast mouth end spend euro salad entre bottl wine,bad review,2

The restaurant is on a quiet back street just off the Paseo de Prado right near the Ritz Hotel. The restaurant is very small, cozy and welcoming.

The chef spent a great deal of time talking with our daughters both of whom speak Spanish fluently. We let him guide our menu choices, and we were not at all disappointed. While we each ordered separate first and second courses, we were all treated to a starter course of a curried crab soup, and a wonderful salad of various fruits and vegetables.

Here you will have a gourmet experience and live any food lovers’ dream.  I went over the long menu (120€) instead a la carte, this is highly recommendable as you get a 5 course dinner plus dessert, and you taste different types of great wines depending on the dish you get. Abraham works with you the different options either on the menu or the house specials based on the season or daily catch, he explains you the details so you can choose the very best. The Foie Gras was superb, the salad amazing, the Oaxacan quesadillas, the cold raspberry soup incredible, a special kind of fish (can’t remember the name) with couscous and potatoes, and for the “grand finale” one of the best desserts I’ve had, the dark chocolate soufflé on banana leaves. It was a shame I was full already, as I could have repeated the dessert many times! And you not only get to pamper your taste, you also get your share on the sight, as all dishes a very nicely served, it’s a shame to eat them (just kidding!)

I got a table in the corner and studied the menu. The chef happened to come out of the kitchen and he saw me sitting by myself while the other tables were full of patrons chatting with their companions. I asked for help choosing a dish and he asked me what I liked. I told him I'll eat anything. He nodded, took the menu away and what happened after was magical. He created a custom tasting menu for me of 6 courses. The foie gras as part of the first course was excellent --- high grade foie gras. Be careful of ""foie"" in Spain, sometimes it's really just cheap pate but this is excellent foie. I also loved the wild mushroom risotto with sweet breads. The rice was of perfect consistency and full of flavor with the sweet breads adding a nice richness and flavor. I also loved the sword fish cooked in some kind of herbal leaf -- warm and slightly crispy on the outside but sashimi style on the inside. And let's not forget the boar and venison with rosemary infused lentils. This was truly a delightful meal. And the chef charged me such a reasonable price. Thank you.

During our two-hour dinner, the chef frequently mingled with his Spanish guests - while pointedly ignoring our table. He did serve the risotto personally - as he did for all who ordered it - but he never spoke to us again, while he chatted amiably with all other tables. We do not expect everyone to speak English, but everyone else we've met in Spain has been willing to communicate with us using their limited English and our even more limited Spanish. On top of the lack of courtesy and respect for their guests, Viridiana also follows the practice we've encountered at nearly all restaurants in Spain: They bring bread to your table, whether you ask for it or not, then they add a hefty charge to your bill. Here, where you would expect more elegant service and not to be squeezed for every last Euro, they charge a whopping €5 *per person* for one piece of bread each! The water also is €5. The restaurant also is not smoke-free, and just one smoker is enough to fill the tiny dining room with smoke - not what you want when paying €200+ for two people without dessert. The two couses and two amuses were very good, I must say, but the insulting treatment and overcharges (and smoke) left a very bad taste in our mouths.",2010-10-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or250-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_34897,0.09,0.827,0.083,0.3515,0.053422619047619,0.3753075396825396,0.4780625,1411,119,0.0843373493975903,1,38,False,51,0.0909090909090909,0.0545454545454545,0.2,0.0545454545454545,0.1454545454545454,0.0909090909090909,0.0545454545454545,0.0545454545454545,0.1818181818181818,0.0727272727272727,256,170,4.515625,0,0,nativ spain avoid restaur chef staff clearli like peopl speak fluent spanish perhap dislik tourist two hour dinner chef frequent mingl spanish guest pointedli ignor tabl serv risotto person order never spoke us chat amiabl tabl expect everyon speak english everyon els met spain will commun us use limit english even limit spanish top lack courtesi respect guest viridiana also follow practic encount nearli restaur spain bring bread tabl whether ask add hefti charg bill would expect eleg servic squeez everi last euro charg whop per person one piec bread water also restaur also smoke free one smoker enough fill tini dine room smoke want pay two peopl without dessert two cous two amus good must say insult treatment overcharg smoke left bad tast mouth,very bad review,1

Despite turning up 20 minutes too early, the waitress made us feel very welcome and ffered us drinks until the kitchen was ready. We took the set menu, with wine (although, this seemed to come automatically, but i'm not sure), which was around 9 courses. Every course was a winner, and the only real complaint was that the portions were actually a bit large, so by the end we were struggling! There are one or two minor details that separate this restaurant from being of Michelin Star quality - for example, on a few occasions if I had finished before my partner or vice versa, they took one plate and waited until the other finished then before taking their plate - it would be far classier and less stressed if they waited until both diners had finished before taking both plates simultaneously - but this is a small gripe, especially when set in the context of a fantastic meal. 5 stars, recommended.

The meal began with two quite substantial amuses-bouches: A lovely soup, followed by a rather large salad of fruit, vegetables and iberian ham.

My husband ordered the special risotto with white truffles---Chef Garcia personally grated a pretty generous amount of truffle on the rice---enough that we were a little nervous about the price but it was only 30 euros which is very reasonable, considering the amuse-bouches.

We went here and enjoyed the people and the food. The Tapas are small, but are meant to entice your appetite for dish of more food. There is a beef sample plate and a seafood sample plate. Nether is meant for one person, ensure you have at least two to four hungry friends to help. The beef plate is delicious. We had it twice. I highly recommend the steak. It is very good. The cook puts on a sea salt that is noticeable and tasty. Also, you are in Spain, have the Sangria. Don't waste time with glasses, get the pitcher, you will want more.

A lot of careful thought has gone into La Perejila - ""Parsley"" in English - right down to the 1920s decor. It's like you're having dinner in the home of a flamboyant grandma. We had the gazpacho, meatball and squid dishes, all great and generously portioned. We won't forget the bearded guy who I assume was the owner. After dinner he brought us a digestif in the form of glasses of orange wine, free of charge, and when I expressed interest in the wine, he left the bottle with us. As we paid he poured us another glass and toasted us.  It was a spur of the moment gesture but it really elevated our last night in Madrid.

We needed food and just googled restaurants, and found Flavia. What a find! Greeted by by a very friendly and professional team, didn't book until 10.30pm..so thought we were lucky to get in. They are open till late! They give u this complementary thin sliced pork and dip, made from mayonnaise, truffles, tuna and anchovies... not that keen on any of that, apart from tuna. BUT, this sauce is aaamazing, mixed with the ham and bread your given, myself and my partner thought we could just eat that all night. Anyway the rest of the meals are amazing, we loved it so much we went back a second night, not sure if there is a better review metric that exists. Pollo Milanese the first night, and the pollo Flavia the second night...chicken, cream sauce, mushrooms, choose the pasta option... music playing was current but good, an Italian with a modern excellent feel and vibe, would recommend this Italian whole heartedly...I will be going back again. And again. Prices are also very reasonable. Awesome - from the both of us!

This restaurant was an accidental find when walking around and exploring our first day in the beautiful city of Madrid, Spain.   The service and hospitality of this Italian restaurant was outstanding! (So, good we went back a second time) We first came across this establishment late one night when myself and three other friends were looking for something to eat. We didn’t look the best especially compared to what other people in the restaurant were wearing, but the staff didn’t care about that and took us imminently to a table and explained the big menu they had to offer. This Italian restaurant will take you no matter how you dress. The servers show that they really are for what they do and constantly check in on you and see what you need.  The food here was some of the best Italian I’ve had in a long time, and I am Italian. We were hungry so we ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 4 desserts and 4 of the specialty drinks they had that night. All of the food was an experience of its own. Every bite was filled with flavor and creativity. The food made us come back for a second time and would probably be a third time if we had more time in this city.   This is a restaurant that is a MUST EAT AT destination in the corners of back streets. The management and food will wow you and your whole group for sure.

You really do need to book in advance for this place. The only improvement we might suggest is playing a little quiet music upstairs - it’s so intimate you can hear every conversation at every table.

We walked around the area where our airbnb was and found El Mollete. I asked if they were still open and the waitress said they were but we would need to order quickly as the kitchen was closing. I almost wish she'd said they were closed...  When we got to sit down (in this VERY VERY tight corner upstairs), we got the feeling she was rushing us more than necessary.   My friends don't speak Spanish so I had to translate quite a bit and i felt like that was inconvenient for them and as a result found them quite curt and short with us. We inquired if some of the food was coming and their response was unnecessarily rude.  The food we were able to have, however, was really lovely! They asked to go and pay downstairs (which is unusual) but offered us a ""chupito"" with the bill.  I doubt I'll go there again.

You need to be prepared to grab a bite at the bar very often as there are very few tables, but if you're prepared to wait for one, it's definitely worth it. The place is decorated like you might expect to find at your grandmothers or even great grandmothers and the music is also of that era. so if that's not for you, don't go.

We did it. We sat. And 10 minutes later, there was a queue and lots of people on the bar waiting for a table. Regarding the food, I loved the Cod in olive oil with paprika from La Vera. Unfortunately, there were not meatballs that day so they suggested the tail of the bull and we ordered it and it was very tender and tasty. Recommended!

When we arrived there at 20.45 on a Tuesday evening, there appeared to be a crowd of people outside the bar. I wondered if it had just opened as everyone began piling inside and we got the last available table (lucky us ) We had Surtido de Ibericos (a platter of mixed hams/sausages), the Perejilas (meatballs) and Salmorejo Cordobes (fresh Cordoben style tomato purée, served with ham, hard boiled egg and olive oil). Along with plenty of bread, this was ample between 3 of us. For postre (dessert) we had the daily special, a cheesecake, and a chocolate cake which came with chocolate mousse and has got to be one of the best desserts I have ever had! We washed it all down with some fantastic wine and beer and were given a small glass of orange flavoured fortified wine on the house, which I think you may get if you order a dessert - it was very nice.  I can't remember how much the bill came to. I think it is a little more expensive than some of the other Tapas bars in the area, but it is well worth paying that little extra. The staff are friendly and work very hard, they are really good at looking after everyone's needs. The place itself is so cute and quirky - one of those kind of places that you won't forget in a hurry and will tell other people to visit.  La Perejila was recommended to us by our Spanish apartment host, Marta. It is her favourite Tapas Bar in Madrid and I can see why.

Not only tourists but locals and the mix was perfect.  Wine and cava very cheap and generously poured with tapas appearing haphazardly as we drank at the bar. Went for one drink and stayed for three. Even had a couple of complimentary shots of an orange liqueur as we asked for the bill. Lovely touch was the owner asked what we had had to drink as hadn’t been making notes! Staff were very friendly although manically busy as any vacated table was quickly filled.  The tapas was excellent and we saw lots of food being taken to diners at their tables and that looked really good too.

By far the most expensive meal we had in Madrid and easily the worst. For a city with so many exciting, cutting edge restaurants the food here was really quite old fashioned in a early nineties 'fusion' kind of way. The dishes were incoherent and very hit and miss. Hake with romesco sauce and sweet potato just wasn't very nice. Pork with peach was better (a great piece of meat, nicely cooked), but the deep fried monfkish with apple and pickles was just really poor - basically soggy scampi with a bad tartar sauce. The dish of the night was the fresh fruit for dessert, literally some slices of mango and papaya plus passion fruit, which says it all. There are much better places to eat in Madrid that offer much much better value e.g. the fabulous Triciclo.

Accepting the suggestion of our waiter we shared our starter - herring ('arenque') with mango and avocado. Right choice: it was delicious! Right amount when shared. My partner's main - a sushi'ish dish of salmon, sword-fish and tuna - had too much sauce for our taste and didn't sit right after the raw herring. (We made a bad choice.)

This restaurant was recommended on the elite traveller website as one of the 8 best restaurants in Madrid together with a few Michelin star restaurants that I wanted to book ahead but were closed on Sundays. It's has also been featured by Conde Nast traveller online.  So I called the restaurant and they happen to have a table for us. Restaurant opens at 8.30pm and was fully packed by the time we left. They have cute ceramic plates in the shape of cowboy hats which I believe the chef likes to wear.  Service was great and they have specials - we were lucky that they received some white truffles from France that day and made an excellent risotto with white truffles. The chef Abraham Gracia will come out and slice the truffles onto your plate. I also tried the cerviche with 3 fresh fish and it was also wonderful. I would give this place a visit as it is a nice place for dinner and the location is not too far away from the Salamanca shopping area.

The menu is not for the faint hearted, and I must admit to chickens get out my having a grilled pork main. Such items as a sheeps head and lamb intestines can be found on the menu! Do not let this put you off. Firstly we had, not ordered, a gaspacho each severed in small individual pots with lids. Excellent. Again not ordered but with the chefs compliments small picked herrings in a dill sauces. Very tasty and well presented. My wife has a small appetite and therefore was only ever going to order a main, however at the recommendation of the waiter she had some of my pasta with blue cheese sauce and pears. We could not finish this between us. Steak my wife had was very good, but for us she wisely had the sauce on one side. This was chocolate based, and a step too far for us. My pork was very good served with potatoes and prunes. No deserts ordered, but nonetheless we had some speed nibbles, with the restaurants compliments. We shared a bottle of very fine champagne, ( bought as a surprise by our 3 children) and I had a single glass of red with my main. €97 the lot. ,amazing.

I must say I was left with two distinct impressions: one, the food can be unworldly or disappointing, and two, it is VERY expensive. Excellent service in an intimate setting. One dish, the butter fish, could have been the best fish dish I've ever tasted in my life. Another called knives was one of the worst. And so it went. Most dishes were enjoyable, and I can't fault the chef for putting his own spin on them. By far the majority were delicious, some sensational. But my biggest complaint of all? Asking for vino de la casa (house wine), devouring almost 2 bottles, and being charged by the glass. In an establishment with this kind of reputation, I would have expected different.

But, I was surprised by 2 things: (i) there was one pure vegetarian option on the menu - the gazpacho (ii) and, it was 25€ for a small bowl Although good - I didn't think it was that much better than what I make at home and certainly not worth 25€. Furthermore, I was disappointed that this was the cheapest dinner item on the small menu (the desserts were 15€). To the restaurant's credit, when we asked about veggie options, they did suggest they could prepare a plate of grilled veggies. However, I'm really getting sick of that as 'the only' off-the-menu option for vegetarians particularly when the menu (at least at Viridiana) is so interestingly varied otherwise. Otherwise, as mentioned, the menu looked really interesting for non-vegetarians and the ambiance is intimate and with nice decor and friendly English-Spanish speaking wait-staff.",2012-05-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or230-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_35063,0.059,0.742,0.199,0.9782,0.0945833333333333,0.6020238095238095,0.73872,901,66,0.0732519422863485,0,36,False,33,0.1,0.125,0.3,0.05,0.15,0.025,0.05,0.0,0.125,0.075,153,109,4.895424836601308,0,0,cannot fault food delici surpris thing one pure vegetarian option menu gazpacho ii small bowl although good think much better make home certainli worth furthermor disappoint cheapest dinner item small menu dessert restaur credit ask veggi option suggest could prepar plate grill veggi howev realli get sick menu option vegetarian particularli menu least viridiana interestingli vari otherwis otherwis mention menu look realli interest non vegetarian ambianc intim nice decor friendli english spanish speak wait staff,bad review,2

Upon arrival, we (me + wife) dismiss any aperitif and go straight for the menu. Meanwhile a small plate of excellent olives appears. As we are getting ready to order the chef shows up and sits down next to us (restaurant was mostly empty at 9.30pm, but he still did it with other people after it was full) and ran through a batch of off-menu dishes. He spoke with the certainty awarded by his experience and punctuated his remarks with snappy comments. We ended up choosing one of the starters he mentioned (an interesting take on ceviche, with mango, papaya and avocado) but stuck to the plan with the main courses. The wine was overpriced, as many commenters had mentioned on TripAdvisor. Went for a red Muga 2012 (40 euros), which was a reliable bet as Muga usually is. Though I could've sworn I had asked for a 2011 bottle. Anyway. A bit after ordering, another starter was brought to our table, a mixture of ham, gazpacho, vegetables and others. All placed side-by-side to combine as a dish. If that makes sense. We were not charged for this and it was probably the most memorable of dishes we had there - sadly, because it was either bad luck or we didn't make the right choices.  The ceviche - which we split - was refreshing, as I mentioned. And then came the main courses, both of them meat. Mine was a very elegant beef steak with marrow. Very, very low on salt and maybe a bit overcooked, but that's on me for ordering it 'medium'. The baked potatoes were a lot saltier than the meat. The wife had 'shoulder of lamb' (can't tell if this is the correct translation). It was massive. M-a-s-s-i-v-e. Tasty, but the poppy seeds really did most of the work.  We ended up ordering a panna cotta with passion fruit and coconut mousses, which was also decent. The waiter brought an added sample of another dessert, with chocolate truffles, also on the house.  We ended up paying 160 euros. Not unexpected, but also definitely exceeding what I thought was the value of that meal. We don't often go to top-rated/high-charging restaurants. We did this time because it was my wife's birthday and we were abroad. It was a great evening and we enjoyed our meal. But can't help feeling as if there was something missing. The taste: Good, but could've been a lot better. The atmosphere: Very classic, but dated. The waiters: It was the only time in Madrid I felt like I could've gotten a better treatment if I had been wearing a tie or something smarter than a polo shirt (fancy by my standards). The background music: unbearable, but perhaps mandatory?  TL;DR: good meal, as expected, but it could have and should have been cheaper and/or just better.",2016-06-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or100-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_35077,0.041,0.825,0.135,0.9949,0.2255196523053665,0.554911186696901,0.4096885714285714,2803,242,0.0863360684980378,0,112,False,88,0.1538461538461538,0.1442307692307692,0.2692307692307692,0.0576923076923076,0.1057692307692307,0.0288461538461538,0.0384615384615384,0.0384615384615384,0.0961538461538461,0.0673076923076923,500,304,4.6,0,0,made reserv hour ahead receiv e mail confirm phone call one hour schedul time enjoy kind attent upon arriv wife dismiss aperitif go straight menu meanwhil small plate excel oliv appear get readi order chef show sit next us restaur mostli empti pm still peopl full ran batch menu dish spoke certainti award experi punctuat remark snappi comment end choos one starter mention interest take cevich mango papaya avocado stuck plan main cours wine overpr mani comment mention tripadvisor went red muga euro reliabl bet muga usual though could sworn ask bottl anyway bit order anoth starter brought tabl mixtur ham gazpacho veget other place side side combin dish make sens charg probabl memor dish sadli either bad luck make right choic cevich split refresh mention came main cours meat mine eleg beef steak marrow low salt mayb bit overcook order medium bake potato lot saltier meat wife shoulder lamb tell correct translat massiv v e tasti poppi seed realli work end order panna cotta passion fruit coconut mouss also decent waiter brought ad sampl anoth dessert chocol truffl also hous end pay euro unexpect also definit exceed thought valu meal often go top rate high charg restaur time wife birthday abroad great even enjoy meal help feel someth miss tast good could lot better atmospher classic date waiter time madrid felt like could gotten better treatment wear tie someth smarter polo shirt fanci standard background music unbear perhap mandatori tl dr good meal expect could cheaper better,average review,3

The staff was friendly from the moment we walked in and the storied chef visited us several times to chat and make sure all was ok.  My colleague is a vegetarian and although the menu had a limited selection of vegetable only selections the kitchen went out of its way to alter some of the dishes to satisfy her.  My meals off the menu were all terrific. I particularly liked the risotto and the dessert mousse and sorbet were both fabulous.

The waiting service was awful. The rude, inattentive and complacent waiters ignored us completely to start with, and it took them quite a good 20 minutes to realise we were waiting for them to take our orders as they were too busy chatting to each other. We do not undertand why this place is so over-rated. Perhaps, the idea is to lure naive travellers to this place for 'canteen food' at outrageous prices. The two amuse-bouches offered at the beginning might have been a nice touch, but they were tasteless and completely over-cooked. The waiters initially forgot that we had requested no red meat for my partner when making our booking, and brought him a dish with cured ham, so we had to ask them to correct their mistake. My salad was drowning in vinegar which made it too sour to eat and the prawns wrapped in breadcrumb were so soggy that I wondered if they were safe to eat. What was advertised as the chef's signature dish (lamb tripe served with chick peas and egg) turned out to be just some kind of glorified farmer's food, which I must admit was far worse than that we had elsewhere outside Madrid. To make things worse, the desert we wanted was not available. As previously reported by one of the reviewers, the waiter who brought us the bill pointed it clearly to us that the service was not included. At that point, my partner replied that we declined to leave any tip as we really did not enjoy our meal. I definitely will caution people against this rather odd restaurant where the chef and two of his assistants went home in front of the guests and even before some of them had started their meal. I had not witnessed anything like this before.",2016-03-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or110-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_19941,0.107,0.833,0.06,-0.9081,-0.0692528735632184,0.5146551724137931,0.5713692307692307,1747,163,0.0933028048082427,0,34,False,53,0.0588235294117647,0.1029411764705882,0.2205882352941176,0.0441176470588235,0.1176470588235294,0.0441176470588235,0.0588235294117647,0.0735294117647058,0.1764705882352941,0.1029411764705882,315,202,4.549206349206349,0,0,disappoint dine experi day visit spain wait servic aw rude inattent complac waiter ignor us complet start took quit good minut realis wait take order busi chat undertand place rate perhap idea lure naiv travel place canteen food outrag price two amus bouch offer begin might nice touch tasteless complet cook waiter initi forgot request red meat partner make book brought dish cure ham ask correct mistak salad drown vinegar made sour eat prawn wrap breadcrumb soggi wonder safe eat advertis chef signatur dish lamb tripe serv chick pea egg turn kind glorifi farmer food must admit far wors elsewher outsid madrid make thing wors desert want avail previous report one review waiter brought us bill point clearli us servic includ point partner repli declin leav tip realli enjoy meal definit caution peopl rather odd restaur chef two assist went home front guest even start meal wit anyth like,bad review,2

Out of all my meals, Viridiana was by far my favorite.   The first thing that stood out to me was the warmth and attentiveness of the staff. As I only speak a little Spanish, sometimes it can be challenging to have an engaging experience with the staff of restaurants in Spain. That was not the case at Viridiana, and I found the service to be the best of my entire stay in Madrid. This comfort was enhanced by the playfulness of the restaurant. The food similarly impressed. The variety of the food made for a memorable experience. I had an opportunity to try baby eels and lamb tripe for the first time, and I was impressed with the preparation on both. The foie gras was the best I have ever had. The bitter notes that overwhelm others’ foie gras was not present and the texture was perfect. The food on the whole was very impressive and superior to everywhere else I ate during my time in Madrid.   Most importantly, the chef’s love of cooking and bringing joy through food shined through. The free appetizers provided were exceedingly generous. The chef was even kind enough to send me out a third free appetizer after I shared my love of the foie gras with the waiter. I could tell the food was made by someone whose heart is in cooking food that brings happiness. While my dinner at El Club Allard was extremely well-executed, it lacked the same focus on bringing joy to the diners that I felt at Viridiana. The food at Viridiana is clearly made with heart, and that makes for a very enjoyable dining experience.",2016-03-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or110-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_26603,0.012,0.721,0.267,0.9983,0.4036184210526316,0.5994736842105264,0.2325058823529412,1666,155,0.0930372148859543,0,28,False,52,0.1123595505617977,0.2696629213483146,0.348314606741573,0.0224719101123595,0.2022471910112359,0.0,0.0,0.0112359550561797,0.0224719101123595,0.0112359550561797,302,162,4.506622516556291,0,0,opportun eat number well regard restaur short stay madrid includ michelin star el club allard meal viridiana far favorit first thing stood warmth attent staff speak littl spanish sometim challeng engag experi staff restaur spain case viridiana found servic best entir stay madrid comfort enhanc play restaur food similarli impress varieti food made memor experi opportun tri babi eel lamb tripe first time impress prepar foie gra best ever bitter note overwhelm other foie gra present textur perfect food whole impress superior everywher els ate time madrid importantli chef love cook bring joy food shine free appet provid exceedingli gener chef even kind enough send third free appet share love foie gra waiter could tell food made someon whose heart cook food bring happi dinner el club allard extrem well execut lack focu bring joy diner felt viridiana food viridiana clearli made heart make enjoy dine experi,very good review,5

The one night we had ""only"" dessert, we regretted not having our entire dinner there. As we summarized it during our last dinner here: amazing food, great prices, awesome service, cool atmosphere.  The first night we had the ""menu del noche"", for 12.5 euro per person, which included all together 2 starts, 2 main dishes, wine (sangria in our case), bread, and dessert! We also got 2 shots ""on the house"" at the end of the meal. The Leche Frita (fried milk) dessert was so good, that we came back the second night after a less magnificent dinner somewhere else. This time, the dessert, sangria and a glass of CREMA DE ORUJO (an amazing liquor, a bit like Baileys) was almost 7 euros. Again, wow. The third and last night in Madrid we knew exactly where we're going to have dinner. This evening we took the seafood platter for 30 euros, which had 4 types of shripms and lobsters and came with salad and french fries. Yummmm!!!

We then found this restaurant in a top 10 Madrid book with a good write up detailing It would be perfect for an occasion, as it was our five year anniversary we thought brilliant! and our hotel booked us a table. Upon arrival we were shown to our table on the bottom floor of the restaurant, it was very nice and clean and had a lovely lighting to the room.  The menu was presented with a slightly minimalistic amount although we both ordered something we felt happy with.  I had the hake with mushrooms and my partner had the lobster risotto. Beforehand, an appetiser of asparagus and ham soup that we hadn't ordered appeared and the waiter said it was a speciality from the chef, although we ate it and it was very nice, I'm not sure how I feel about being charged for it as we didn't order it? As we had finished the appetiser, The Head Chef came out and spoke to diners within the restaurant. As well as our own table, there were two other couples, a group of men and a family with two small children also in the restaurant. The Chef made an effort to speak to each table, even when he approached a table that only knew English or Polish, he got the head waiter to translate for him I presume he only knew Spanish. The Chef said ""Hola"" to my partner and I but that was it, however every other table got a conversation. To us this was rude and dismissive of us. Not sure why he felt he didn't need to engage with us like all the others?! As my partner is a chef back home, he was confused as to why the chef wouldn't communicate with everyone, especially if he knew the waiter could translate!  My Hake with mushrooms was nice although the fish lacked in flavour, was rather bland to say the least. My partner enjoyed his dish but nothing he felt to rave home about.  We finished off with dessert, unfortunately the vanilla moose I had ordered was not available, but the waiter's did not inform me of this until at least 5+ minutes after I ordered. Instead I had pineapple sorbet and my partner had sponge pudding with chocolate sauce. Both quite plain but tasty. Some of the staff were nice, others lacking in customer service.

We'd been recommended a couple of restaurants but found they were closed for the holidays; TripAdvisor revealed a restaurant close by that was open: Viridiana. I didn't realise quite how close by till we booked by phone and made the one-minute walk.  The name appealed (I love Bunuel's film), and the decor seemed pleasingly tasteful, the mood relaxed but mercifully not loud. The food was very well cooked and presented (with some nice unexpected extras), the service attentive, helpful but not intrusive; the wine list noticeably good, mostly upmarket but still with some reasonable affordable bottles. While certainly not cheap, we felt it a sufficiently good and good-value to reserve, upon leaving, for our second night - when we had an even better dinner and an even more enjoyable experience. In particular, the Peruvian-style marinaded tuna, swordfish and sea bass was ultra delicious, and the duck cannelloni the best cannelloni I'd ever had. For tinto there is a very reasonable Sardon de Duero though it's probably worth paying a bit more for the Pesquera Crianza.

I love the food (the pulpo!), the atmosphere, the room, the friendliness of the patrons, and the staff. How they manage to keep everything straight and everyone happy and attended to never ceases to amaze me.  You get nibbles with every drink you order and could easily get by for lunch just on the olives, cheese, chorizo and the like that would come with a few drinks. They don't repeat these freebies either. Again, how they keep tabs on all this is beyond me. The servers are obviously efficient, but they are also friendly and even a bit sassy at times, in a gentle and fun way. If you are Baja Cava, do yourself a favor and stop in, lunchtime or in the evening. I'd be shocked if you didn't walk out with a smile on your face. Oh, and it is inexpensive.

The restaurant is small and nice, although we had to cope with an annoying motor-like noise during all the dinner. Waiters are very professional, perfect service. Abraham, the chef, came to read us the menu, in a funny, intellectual and professional way. We could not say ""no"" to his offer and ordered a citrics salad, veal trotters and hake. Tropical fruits for dessert. The meals were original, well presented and elaborated, but the greatest value is in the food quality. Incredibly fresh and tasty ingredients. This is called ""market cuisine"", but I do not find that high quality in the markets I visit :-). I can not give my opinion about wines, because we had to drive so we just drank water.

The setting is charming (movies and horses figure prominently) and the presentations are imaginative and elegant. The restaurant is just a few blocks from the Ritz and the Grand Hotel, near the Parquet de Madrid. The amuse bouche was a tomato bisque with (of all things) chopped herring and strawberries accompanied by a ginger blini topped with chourico and a poached quail egg. Amazing favors and the all really worked together. We had wonderful salads and breads before a main course of fish. Everything was exquisite lay prepared with attentive service and comfortable communications (English, Spanish, French). As noted by other reviewers, Viridiana is not inexpensive.

The place is charming with its movie theme and perfect for any occasion: business or romantic or family dinner or lunch. Our large table was perfectly set and the service staff was highly competent. The food is outstanding and I could see that everyone shared my view on this. After the delicious cold strawberry velvety soup as ""mise en bouche"" appetizer, I went for the sea snails and then the steak. For desert I had the figue sorbet. I really enjoyed all the dishes and their flavor. The wine selection is also great. The Chef (A. Garcia) came to see us to ensure that we were happy which is a nice touch.

I'm soooooo glad we chose here!! The decoration, music, staffs and atmosphere smack of true Madrid, and the food and drink are to die for!! We had two glasses of fantastic sangria to start with whilst waiting for a table, because the place was absolutely buzzing - but not so full you couldn't move. This was so fun, and with our drinks they served the most AMAZING home-made chorizo! The friendly and efficient (and, for the most part, also English-speaking!) staff ushered us to our table in short order, and then quickly took our food and drink orders with a smile; they all seem to take genuine pleasure in their jobs! The menu was extensive, from mouth-watering tapas to full sit-down meals; we opted for a BIG PLATE OF MEATS which we had learned of from other trip-advisees (only 18EUR!). We were SO NOT SORRY BECAUSE IT WAS AWESOME!! Our food and accompanying jug of sangria arrived lightning fast, and without realising it we devoured most of our food but couldn't finish it all because there was so much! We drank and laughed, and before we knew it we had been sitting there for hours! We moved to the bar in an attempt to finish our jug of sangria (this turned out to be an impossible task), and when we asked for the bill we laughed and laughed when it came to only 33EUR for our two sangrias, our JUG of sangria, and too much food to finish! To top it off, they gave us several free nightcaps as well...we practically floated home! Best night ever; so good we almost felt stingy for only leaving a 10EUR tip! Everything was beyond our expectations and we would NEVER leave a restaurant that happy for that little money in Australia - especially in Perth, the most expensive and over-rated place for eating on the planet.

Once for the seafood parillada and meatballs and the other for the set menu through out the day.  We first stumbled into here after walking through out the night looking for some where to have a light meal and enjoy some time alone with the wife. Our plan was to try a couple of places going for a walk around the area after a drink and small tapas at each place. When we stuck our head in the buscon we realised we had found some thing special with the ambience alone. Then we had the meatballs and a jug of Sangria. During this time we saw numerous dishes go by and one stood out above all. The seafood platter. We pealed our selves out of there in search of other areas to find out selves strangly drawn back to the buscon. Let me just say the seafood platter was a delight so much that my wife who dosent eat seafood was in love. The atmosphere was fun and the time special.  We have now come back the next day for the set menu. Some of the best food and value in Madrid.

We didn't have a reservation but were seated without a problem upstairs. Owner/ chef sat himself down with us and went through the menu.

I was first intrigued by the very sensual tile pictures, so popped in for a coffee. The coffee was the best I've had in Madrid. Other people were obviously enjoying their breakfasts so I decided to return to sample it (I'd already eaten).  I went back today & ordered an orange juice, coffee & Spanish omelette. Coffee still great, juice freshly squeezed, & a very generous slice of absolutely delicious piping hot tortilla. This handsome breakfast cost 4.10 euros. The staff are very welcoming & speak some English but go out of their way to cater for your needs. Given that my next stop was to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando five minutes walk away, I returned to Melibea for lunch on my way home. I was greeted like a long lost friend. I had the dish of the day which I deduced from the limited translation was some sort of beef dish, which I was assured was delicious. It turned out to be beef cheek braised in red wine with steamed rice. Again a generous serve & it was melt in the mouth & indeed very delicious. An entree of tuna & potato salad was included, as was a pot of beer, fresh crusty bread & a choice of three desserts: mouse au chocolate, profiteroles or flan. I chose the flan which turned out to be a very agreeable creme caramel. All of this set me back a mere 7 euros! On receipt of the bill I was given a complimentary glass of a Spanish version of Baileys on ice.  I can't recommend this taverna highly enough.",2015-10-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3822333-Reviews-or70-Bodegas_Melibea-Madrid.html,UID_34182,0.033,0.785,0.183,0.9937,0.2601806239737274,0.4121100164203613,0.4426411764705881,1501,123,0.0819453697534976,1,43,False,48,0.074074074074074,0.1851851851851851,0.3148148148148148,0.037037037037037,0.2037037037037037,0.037037037037037,0.0185185185185185,0.0,0.0925925925925925,0.037037037037037,282,184,4.319148936170213,0,0,three time stay madrid first intrigu sensual tile pictur pop coffe coffe best madrid peopl obvious enjoy breakfast decid return sampl alreadi eaten went back today order orang juic coffe spanish omelett coffe still great juic freshli squeez gener slice absolut delici pipe hot tortilla handsom breakfast cost euro staff welcom speak english go way cater need given next stop royal academi fine art san fernando five minut walk away return melibea lunch way home greet like long lost friend dish day deduc limit translat sort beef dish assur delici turn beef cheek brais red wine steam rice gener serv melt mouth inde delici entre tuna potato salad includ pot beer fresh crusti bread choic three dessert mous au chocol profiterol flan chose flan turn agreeabl creme caramel set back mere euro receipt bill given complimentari glass spanish version bailey ice recommend taverna highli enough,good review,4

There is a bar in the back of the room and a shelf with stools along one side. It was only 12:30 PM on a weekday, so there was no trouble getting a table. A young woman who spoke English brought us tapas menus in Spanish and English and told us specials for the day. She recommended 3 to 4 tapas for the four of us.  We ordered artichoke hearts with with a buttery wine sauce. Artichoke hearts are one of my favorite foods, but this blew away every other artichoke heart I had ever had. Followed by an avocado salad, which was really a smoked salmon, smoked fish, mixed green salad with some cheese. Also outstanding. Then, they brought us a mushroom risotto with tiny shrimp. I eat a lot of risotto, and this was perfectly prepared. Finally, squid with hummus crowned it all. We drank some wine and water, and crowned off the lunch with some coffee. Perfect. Besides the young woman who spoke English who helped us order, we were served by a friendly who I believe were the longtime owners. Whoever was in the kitchen was very talented. The upstairs room with 4 to 5 tables was packed by the time we left at 2:30, and bar on the first floor was full. we did not need to book at 12:30 PM, but I would do so later in the day.

Saw the reviews of this place and decided to give it a try. It was just around the corner from our apartment. Small place with downstairs bar and one table. Had to wait a bit for one of the 4-5 tables upstairs, but glad we did. The owner came up and sat down next to us to tell us the daily specials in rapid fire Madrillano Spanish. Then he repeated in rapid (heavily accented English) for the German family next to us. Place was so small, you felt like you were eating with the people next to you, but it was a fun and friendly atmosphere. Had an avocado salad, which was much more than avocados - more like a regular Spanish mixed salad with tuna, smoked salmon and a whole sliced avocado too. Calamari in GARLIC sauce was good and REALLY garlicky. Grilled rabbit and fries was really tasty, but had too many small pieces of bone. We shared with the Germans and they gave us a taste of their bacalao. Everything was delicious. Ordered a chocolate lava cake for dessert that came with a scoop of very lightly sweetened caramel ice cream. Then to top it off they gave us a couple of glasses of after dinner drinks. Wanted to come back the following night, but unfortunately they were going on vacation and going to be closed.

So after reading lots of positive reviews online and from the NY Times we decided to give it a try. We went without a reservation because we had tried to call a few times and no one had picked up. When we got there (fairly early around 9 pm) there was only one table eating and we were seated at the stool area. Thinking this was because we didn't have a reservation it was fine. A few more people came in, also without reservations and were seated at tables. We thought this was kind of rude, especially since we had spoken spanish the entire time and used absolutely no english. We asked for a wine menu but there was none so we instead asked for the cheapest wine bottle. It was a fine Rioja. We orderdc the food which was okay nothing to rave about - especially after coming from Barcelona where we were blown away by the food. The rabbit was mostly bones and the mushrooms were extremely slimy giving off a gross feeling in the mouth. The calamari and pork were very good. The duck was also so-so. The best part of the meal (hint hint) comes when a waiter from the balcony drops a wine glass that hits our plate of food and shatters everywhere. The glass goes on me, my partner in the food and bread basket. Everyone gasps and tells us to watch out as another large chunk of glass almost fell on my partners neck. It fell about 7 feet which could have seriously injured us. The waiter just looks down, cleans up the glass on the floor and doesn't bother to come over. We try to get his attention in Spanish for around 20 minutes. Finally another table gets up and talks to him, he responds ""someone else will deal with it"". Furriated at this point I debate leaving without paying not knowing what to do. Finally he comes over and clears all the food with glass in it and the glass off the counter. No apology yet. We are talking to some patrons who apologize for the owners/waiters and we express how upset we are over this. They didn't even try to bring us a new dish or comp the food. The patrons warn the owner we are upset because of the lack of caring, especially since it was fortunate that we weren't hurt. He doesn't seem to care either just asks us if we want desert or coffee. We decline and ask for the check. We get the check and are amazed to find out the cheapest bottle of wine was 16 euros. 16 euros for a bottle that cost 3 - 4 euros in the supermarket. This is our 12th day in Spain so we have been eating out quite a lot and have NEVER, not once EVER been to a place that doesn't have a bottle of wine in the 10 euro range. We don't know what to do, it seems pointless to complain. We don't pay quick enough as he comes over looking for the money then walks away angry. I leave the bill which was 56 euros and absolutely no tip with that kind of service. As we thank the nice table for helping us he scowls at us for no tip im guessing. The nerve of this restaurant. This was honestly the worst dining experience I have ever had and urge anyone to seriously consider where they want to spend their money.",2010-07-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1728085-Reviews-or120-El_Mollete-Madrid.html,UID_35161,0.081,0.827,0.091,0.7765,0.0876674209628755,0.5777831890331889,0.3989305555555555,3159,310,0.0981323203545425,0,63,False,127,0.0802919708029197,0.1094890510948905,0.1897810218978102,0.0656934306569343,0.1313868613138686,0.0802919708029197,0.0510948905109489,0.0510948905109489,0.145985401459854,0.0948905109489051,614,325,4.14657980456026,0,0,actual went el mollet tonight bad experi write got back hotel read lot posit review onlin ny time decid give tri went without reserv tri call time one pick got fairli earli around pm one tabl eat seat stool area think reserv fine peopl came also without reserv seat tabl thought kind rude especi sinc spoken spanish entir time use absolut english ask wine menu none instead ask cheapest wine bottl fine rioja orderdc food okay noth rave especi come barcelona blown away food rabbit mostli bone mushroom extrem slimi give gross feel mouth calamari pork good duck also best part meal hint hint come waiter balconi drop wine glass hit plate food shatter everywher glass goe partner food bread basket everyon gasp tell us watch anoth larg chunk glass almost fell partner neck fell feet could serious injur us waiter look clean glass floor bother come tri get attent spanish around minut final anoth tabl get talk respond someon els deal furriat point debat leav without pay know final come clear food glass glass counter apolog yet talk patron apolog owner waiter express upset even tri bring us new dish comp food patron warn owner upset lack care especi sinc fortun hurt seem care either ask us want desert coffe declin ask check get check amaz find cheapest bottl wine euro euro bottl cost euro supermarket th day spain eat quit lot never ever place bottl wine euro rang know seem pointless complain pay quick enough come look money walk away angri leav bill euro absolut tip kind servic thank nice tabl help us scowl us tip im guess nerv restaur honestli worst dine experi ever urg anyon serious consid want spend money,bad review,2

The owner, a Robert DeNiro look-a-like, was quite a character. He took us up a steep staircase into the loft dining room that had six tables squeezed into the space. At first, he seemed a bit peeved that we didn't speak Spanish. A patron at the next table took pity on us and tried to translate as the DeNiro character (and what a character he was) rambled off the menu at top-speed. Having no idea what to order, we told her to tell him we wanted lunch and liked everything but mayonnaise. Small plates were brought to us and each was extremely delicious: teeny-tiny grilled and marinated artichokes, thin pork medallions, marinated octopus salad, perfectly and simply prepared potatoes and for dessert, a magnificent and intensely-flavored molten chocolate lava cake. We returned the next evening for a nightcap and another round of lava cake and DeNiro greeted us like old friends.

We arrived prior to our 3:00pm reservation and the employee was stunned that we needed a table of two - we got seated upstairs very cozy and nice - and were told tapas on Saturday here is the choice, there was no ordering off the menu on the weekends. No problem We had a glass of white wine each and ordered two tapas. I can honestly say the service was nothing outstanding - the young lady serving was rushed off her feet. We ate, had grilled calamari and my husband had the tomato and tuna salad, drank our wine, payed the bill, there was nothing personal about the service. The bill was 32 Euros - we wouldn't rush back and certainly not walk across the city to dine again - there are many restaurants in Madrid - What a shame I was really looking forward to the experience after reading such a great travel blog but after I looked it was 18 months old.",2017-09-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1728085-Reviews-or20-El_Mollete-Madrid.html,UID_35173,0.03,0.892,0.078,0.8556,0.2866428571428571,0.540515873015873,0.34126,1165,105,0.0901287553648068,0,23,False,45,0.1428571428571428,0.1632653061224489,0.2040816326530612,0.0816326530612244,0.1224489795918367,0.0204081632653061,0.0204081632653061,0.1020408163265306,0.1020408163265306,0.0408163265306122,222,139,4.252252252252252,0,0,husband made reserv week advanc lunch saturday commun excel restaur happi walk across citi spend time el mollet recent read travel blog consist two page rave place sure husband would enjoy arriv prior pm reserv employe stun need tabl two got seat upstair cozi nice told tapa saturday choic order menu weekend problem glass white wine order two tapa honestli say servic noth outstand young ladi serv rush feet ate grill calamari husband tomato tuna salad drank wine pay bill noth person servic bill euro rush back certainli walk across citi dine mani restaur madrid shame realli look forward experi read great travel blog look month old,bad review,2

The service was great - enough attention when we needed anything without waiter constantly hovering. The staff coped with our very poor grasp of Spanish and managed to make recommendations whic turned out to be excellent. The highlights were 2 main course shared plates for 2 (though they would have fed at least 3). The first was a range of meats which ranged from chorize and black pudding to steak and chicken. Even better was a large plate containing king prawns, langoustines,crayfish and another shellfish that I can't remember (and I do mean multiples of each). We were pleasantly surprised at the low cost of the food, but even more pleasantly surprised at the even lower cost of the drinks. I would definitely go back.

It was €18 for two people, which I consider a pretty fair amount. We were offered a complimentary tapa, the bread and the chupitos. Also,the glasses of sangria and beer were really generous.

The restaurant has two floors- we ate downstairs which was a very lovely setting. The art on the walls is very interesting, and there are pictures all over from the movies of Luis Bunuel. That is the good news. After we were seated, we were very thirsty from our walk. We were chagrined that a table that came in after us was waited on first, while we were ignored. Eventually the waiter came over and we placed our order. This is where things got very confused. I ordered gazapacho for a first course and fish for my main. We were first served a curry/lentil soup which was excellent, but we had not idea why we got it. Next came a barley dish with octopus. Again, we did not order this. Third came a huge bowl of gazpacho. It was very good, but should have been served in a much smaller portion. Somewhere along the way, our waiter got busy with other tables and it seemed like the bus boy took over. He was very nice, but clearly not our waiter. My main course fish dish was very good, but my husband's pork was not.  The issue that really bothered us was that there is clearly two classes of service at this restaurant. The locals/ regulars, who are frequented at their tables by the chef, seemed to have a different menu than we got. They get lots of attention. The people across from us had small cups of gazpacho, which I would have much preferred. They seemed to have a totatlly different menu. As a tourist, I felt very second class in this restaurant.

It seems to cater to foreigners who visit Madrid for the first time and probably uses its former glory to attract them. Waiters speak English but appear totally to ignore anything about the food and wines offered by the restaurant. (I do not consider English-speaking waiters to be un unambiguous plus for a restaurant because it clearly shows restaurant's intent to razzle-dazzle its foreign clientele to the determent of having people who know something about the food.) My squid dish was just terrible. I left some 80% of it uneaten/untouched. In any ""fancy"", even ""normal"", restaurant, waiter would have reacted, offered to bring a new dish, apologized, made any comment. Nothing here, just picked up the plate. Silence. My friends’ choices were better although not excellent. The wine recommended by the waiter was the most pedestrian you can imagine. The wine card was badly organized with lots of typos and stains. The service was slow. Halfway through dinner they ran of (nice) olive-oil bread.

I always wonder about other's reviews as I know everyone has different tastes. I am a lover of good...truly good food. It does not have to be expensive (often times the low cost meals are much better than the expensive...It just has to be excellent for what it is).  Anyhow...we were recommended Viridiana by the concierge at the hotel, looked it up online and saw that the prices were up there...but really only as a result of the crappy exchange rate with the dollar.  We ultimately made a reservation and let me say that i'm very glad we did.  It's annoying having to read a lot to find out whether a restaurant is good or not. So... In short: Awesome awesome food. One of the best tasting meals I've had in a long time. The flavors and were amazing and the presentation was fantastic . The servers were really nice in their own reserved way. Very laid back ambiance that needed some prodding to get going (I'll explain below). Cost: 217 Euros including (2 vodka martinis, 1 delicious Swedish herring special appetizer that we shared, 1 great bottle of Spanish red wine, 1 perfectly cooked and flavored grilled steak main course, 1 amazing ox-tail tamale wrapped in banana leaf, 2 spectacular desserts (mango panna cota and a chocolate custard, and 2 cups of coffee). I would recommend to any good friend.  Here's the long version.  Leaving our hotel at 10:30 pm, we hoofed it up a slight hill and found Viridiana. As we walked in to the intimate space with about 10 small 10 tables, we were hit with a furnace blast of hot air (though no one seemed to notice as most of the men were eating with their jackets on). Thinking that maybe it was us (having just walked uphill in the cold) and not them, we tried to push away the impending freak out and waited for our body temperatures to normalize.  They took our coats and sat us near the window at a really cute bench style table and poured us water immediately.  We ordered two dry vodka martinis (one dirty) and they made them perfectly. After a few minutes, we realized that it was not us and that temperature was out of control. However, crisis was easily solved after we asked the server (with broken Spanish and hand signals) if there was any way he could lower the temperature. Rather immediately, it cooled to a normal temperature.  We scanned the menu and realized that appetizers were the same price as entrees at around 30 euros, so we decided to split one and make it up on the desserts. We ordered wine and our main courses. It had begun.  We were glad we only ordered 1 appetizer and they soon brought out two small copper pots of the most delicious soup I have tasted in recent history: cream of asparagus with pancetta. They also brought us these great cheddar popover bread balls. This was in addition to the offering of rustic bread rolls with olive oil.  I was served the Swedish herring appetizer special that was beautifully presented on a bed of shaved beets, some really flavorful coulis and some frisee. It was also served with a traditional shot of iced hard alcohol. We asked for another plate so we could share,  This was about the time that I realized that it was oddly quiet in the restaurant..with the odd din of muted conversation. We asked the server if there was music and with an ""Oh yes,"" quickly tunred to the kitchen, flipped the music switch and the ambiance immediately went from sterile to perfect with some traditional spanish guitar music.  The main courses came next. The steak was presented quite nicely. My oxtail tamale (which was not called this, but it what it was) came to the table wrapped and tied in a banana leaf that the server ostentatiously cut and unwrapped for me. It was served with a spectacular side of mole. Delicious.  We ordered to desserts from a list of 10. Both had fantastic flavor combinations of fresh fruit and berries, chocolates in various forms, vanilla and fruit coulis.  Coffee was great (hot, bold and server poured steamed milk at the table).  The service was great in every way. The timing was perfect...neither rushed nor too slow. We always had full glasses of wine, yet never realized the server filling up our glasses.  In summary, the food was amazing. If you can successfully communicate your wishes to the very friendly staff, they are more than willing to accommodate. Price (217 Euros plus 20 euro tip) was well worth the experience.",2011-11-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or240-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_35207,0.026,0.836,0.138,0.9981,0.2965013227513228,0.6181613756613756,0.4359999999999999,4489,355,0.0790822009356204,0,132,False,153,0.16,0.1542857142857142,0.28,0.0514285714285714,0.1257142857142857,0.0457142857142857,0.0057142857142857,0.0285714285714285,0.1028571428571428,0.0457142857142857,800,446,4.5925,0,0,never written review site yet check often travel lot alway wonder review know everyon differ tast lover good truli good food expens often time low cost meal much better expens excel anyhow recommend viridiana concierg hotel look onlin saw price realli result crappi exchang rate dollar ultim made reserv let say glad annoy read lot find whether restaur good short awesom awesom food one best tast meal long time flavor amaz present fantast server realli nice reserv way laid back ambianc need prod get go explain cost euro includ vodka martini delici swedish her special appet share great bottl spanish red wine perfectli cook flavor grill steak main cours amaz ox tail tamal wrap banana leaf spectacular dessert mango panna cota chocol custard cup coffe would recommend good friend long version leav hotel pm hoof slight hill found viridiana walk intim space small tabl hit furnac blast hot air though one seem notic men eat jacket think mayb us walk uphil cold tri push away impend freak wait bodi temperatur normal took coat sat us near window realli cute bench style tabl pour us water immedi order two dri vodka martini one dirti made perfectli minut realiz us temperatur control howev crisi easili solv ask server broken spanish hand signal way could lower temperatur rather immedi cool normal temperatur scan menu realiz appet price entre around euro decid split one make dessert order wine main cours begun glad order appet soon brought two small copper pot delici soup tast recent histori cream asparagu pancetta also brought us great cheddar popov bread ball addit offer rustic bread roll oliv oil serv swedish her appet special beauti present bed shave beet realli flavor couli frise also serv tradit shot ice hard alcohol ask anoth plate could share time realiz oddli quiet restaur odd din mute convers ask server music oh ye quickli tunr kitchen flip music switch ambianc immedi went steril perfect tradit spanish guitar music main cours came next steak present quit nice oxtail tamal call came tabl wrap tie banana leaf server ostentati cut unwrap serv spectacular side mole delici order dessert list fantast flavor combin fresh fruit berri chocol variou form vanilla fruit couli coffe great hot bold server pour steam milk tabl servic great everi way time perfect neither rush slow alway full glass wine yet never realiz server fill glass summari food amaz success commun wish friendli staff will accommod price euro plu euro tip well worth experi,good review,4

We were referred to this place by the reception desk at the hotel we were staying in. We had asked them for an authentic small scale Spanish restaurant, away from any of the touristy joints. We were really glad that we were referred to this place. When we went there for lunch the only people we could see were locals including professionals. The duck and lamb dishes we had were some of the best we ever had and the Garnacha dominated wine was a perfect complement to the food. The owner of this place was very pleasant in spite of the fact that he spoke limited English. The walls of the restaurant had various pictures of people frequenting the restaurant at various times.

The portions are bigger than your typical Spanish tapas which I think is value for money for a lovely night out.

Intimate with tables for 12 people upstairs and a 4- top table plus bar with mostly standing room downstairs. It was relaxing dining with nice lighting unlike some tapas places. Large portions; two tapas was plenty for the two of us to split. We enjoyed the tomatoes with thin pieces of grilled tuna--a ton of tomatoes! The grilled blue fin tuna with soy sauce over fresh spinach, topped with crispy onions included 3 big hunks of tuna. All very tasty. We also ordered a salad with lettuce,tomato, tuna, and slivered onion that wasn't particularly good; lettuce was bitter and tasted like bag lettuce. The Rioja wine by the glass was good.

This owner-run establishment is near the Royal Palace, has been open since 1883, and run by the current owner for 43 years. Some reviewers have called the owner rude, but I would say brusque. He warmed up a great deal when we asked him about the restaurant, how long he had owned it, the picture with his friend, Francis Ford Coppola, and expressed interest in his recommendations for the day. His English is limited and our Spanish is poor, but we felt like old friends by the time we left. The lunch menu was all tapas, but we were interested in the menu of the day, which was prix fixe with three choices for appetizer/salad, 3 for the main, 3 for dessert and includes a beverage and cafe. We had read some recommendations to stay away from the daily menu as general advice, but we have had quite the opposite experience: it is what the typical Spaniard has for lunch and it is a very nice meal. This was definitely true at El Mollete. We started with a very nice glass of white wine, crisp, slightly sweet, and the best we had in Spain. The pour was over my shoulder, so I did not see the label, but as we were leaving I could see the Reds on offer were all premium reservas of the Rioja appellation, so I assume the white was also a premium offering. With the owner's encouragement, my wife had the salad Nicoise and I had the zucchini soup. The salad was incredibly fresh, including the tuna that was not typical canned product. The soup was fabulous. I am not quite sure what the base was, but there seemed to be a strong foundation of potato-leek with unpeeled zucchini, pepper and other spices topped off with a generous amount of truffle oil. A full bowl, and delicious to the end. The course was accompanied by a large baguette of bread, which was six large pieces of bread for the two of us. For our mains, my wife had a very nice fillet of Hake, which was broiled with butter and lemon, and I had medallions of pork loin, medium and also with a bit of Greek spices and a hint of lemon. Both were excellent and accompanied with a side of fried potato chunks that were not quite French friends, but also not quite bravas. Very good and did not make us long for catsup to add taste, which I am quite sure was not available and would have damaged our image with the owner. There is an expectation of mutual respect earned with the dining experience and a few too many clueless tourists have darkened the threshold before you. We were clueless, but self-awareness served us well. We shared a ""brownie"" for dessert with our espresso, which turned out to be a dense flourless chocolate cake, semi-sweet, with a side of vanilla creme sauce. Totally unexpected. Not a blue plate special, and only 11 euros apiece all inclusive. In our home city, the glass of wine would be 11 dollars. Wonderful food served with pride, a terrific deal, and a unique experience. The staff do not speak English, but they will try their best to communicate and really appreciate if you can meet them halfway. A good translation program on the phone helps, read the daily menu posted on the door on your way in, because it is not posted anywhere inside, and ask the owner about the pictures of his many friends posted on the walls. From watching the lunch service, much of the clientele are friends and regulars. We would be if we lived in Madrid.",2015-05-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1728085-Reviews-or60-El_Mollete-Madrid.html,UID_2541,0.036,0.772,0.192,0.9991,0.2270786092214663,0.4953577727387251,0.3209310344827586,3426,320,0.0934033858727378,0,84,False,112,0.1333333333333333,0.15,0.3083333333333333,0.0583333333333333,0.1916666666666666,0.0083333333333333,0.025,0.0166666666666666,0.0666666666666666,0.0416666666666666,631,345,4.431061806656102,0,0,small restaur seat everi seat fill would gridlock owner run establish near royal palac open sinc run current owner year review call owner rude would say brusqu warm great deal ask restaur long own pictur friend franci ford coppola express interest recommend day english limit spanish poor felt like old friend time left lunch menu tapa interest menu day prix fix three choic appet salad main dessert includ beverag cafe read recommend stay away daili menu gener advic quit opposit experi typic spaniard lunch nice meal definit true el mollet start nice glass white wine crisp slightli sweet best spain pour shoulder see label leav could see red offer premium reserva rioja appel assum white also premium offer owner encourag wife salad nicois zucchini soup salad incred fresh includ tuna typic can product soup fabul quit sure base seem strong foundat potato leek unpeel zucchini pepper spice top gener amount truffl oil full bowl delici end cours accompani larg baguett bread six larg piec bread two us main wife nice fillet hake broil butter lemon medallion pork loin medium also bit greek spice hint lemon excel accompani side fri potato chunk quit french friend also quit brava good make us long catsup add tast quit sure avail would damag imag owner expect mutual respect earn dine experi mani clueless tourist darken threshold clueless self awar serv us well share browni dessert espresso turn dens flourless chocol cake semi sweet side vanilla creme sauc total unexpect blue plate special euro apiec inclus home citi glass wine would dollar wonder food serv pride terrif deal uniqu experi staff speak english tri best commun realli appreci meet halfway good translat program phone help read daili menu post door way post anywher insid ask owner pictur mani friend post wall watch lunch servic much clientel friend regular would live madrid,good review,4

Well we had certainly saved the best to last. Abraham Garcia's creations were fabulous with one exception the portion sizes linked with extras were too much. A gazpacho (best in the city) followed by ham and pickles with gluten free bread as muse bouche led us to our entrees. My wife had mushroom mousse with truffle and fried egg a speciality that hit the spot. I had an excellent seafood salad with a citrus sauce with a variety of green leaves. Main courses were lamb leg and calf chop with vegetables both were excellent and cooked to perfection. All accompanied with a tasty Rioja. No room for dessert.

Such a moment was my supper at Viridiana. I had been looking forward to this meal for months and made a reservation before leaving for Madrid. On a quiet residential street, just blocks from the Ritz, one comes upon Viridiana, a lovely little tribute to the Bunuel film and to Abraham Garcia, the chef del restaurante. And, Garcia is not just a name on the door or menu. He is everywhere; greeting, tasting, describing the menu, virtually dancing through the restaurant always focused on his guests. If you're a monolingual American like me, you may miss some of the snappy repartee but you will sense the spirit and fun in the room. If you're an English-only speaker, be sure to have Henry as your waiter. He's a true professional, fun to talk to and a real baseball aficionado. The menu is a dream and the off-menu offerings are prepared from the freshest and some of the most surprising combinations of ingredients. The house adds some lovely small courses to whatever you order that go far beyond the usual ""amuse bouche."" Garcia is an artist and his palette is filled with a beautiful array of flavors and textures guaranteed to delight your palate. Each course is beautifully and cleverly presented. The wine cellar provides a nice selection of wines in a wide range of prices. Service is as perfect as the food. And, Maestro Garcia is always watching. The total Viridiana dining experience is as perfect as a human experience can be. Even the presentation of the bill is unique. I can't wait to go back!",2014-03-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or200-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_35239,0.008,0.752,0.24,0.9978,0.3376302083333333,0.6157986111111112,0.3313055555555555,1627,135,0.0829748002458512,1,40,False,45,0.1333333333333333,0.1866666666666666,0.36,0.08,0.1733333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0266666666666666,0.04,285,185,4.712280701754386,0,0,rare wonder moment element restaur experi come togeth perfect harmoni moment supper viridiana look forward meal month made reserv leav madrid quiet residenti street block ritz one come upon viridiana love littl tribut bunuel film abraham garcia chef del restaurant garcia name door menu everywher greet tast describ menu virtual danc restaur alway focus guest monolingu american like may miss snappi reparte sens spirit fun room english speaker sure henri waiter true profession fun talk real basebal aficionado menu dream menu offer prepar freshest surpris combin ingredi hous add love small cours whatev order go far beyond usual amus bouch garcia artist palett fill beauti array flavor textur guarante delight palat cours beauti cleverli present wine cellar provid nice select wine wide rang price servic perfect food maestro garcia alway watch total viridiana dine experi perfect human experi even present bill uniqu wait go back,good review,4

We went (a bit early, which was good because we did not have a reservation and the place is quite small), four of us, and were seated immediately. We ended up just having them bring what they had... which was amazing. The plating wasn't fancy, but it wasn't the decor or the jazzy presentation that made me want to come back. It was the atmosphere and the FOOD. Comfort food is a very good way to describe this.   Every little morsel was positively delectable. We started with some roasted peppers with a balsamic reduction and ""Philadelphia"" (that company must be thrilled that any time someone needs to refer to cream cheese in Europe, it's with their name... ).. simple and delicious.  Next we had some amazing artichoke hearts with creme de fois. So tender that I nearly needed a spoon!  After this came the morcilla. Now, I will admit. I am a morcilla addict.. if there were meetings for this particular disorder, I would be at all of them, happily. However. These came in thick slices, surrounded by filo pastry, and drizzled with local honey. Simple, but *inasanely* delicious.  I believe the next plate was the croquetas.. shrimp and cod. Yes, please. These can differ all over the city, but Ursula's were creamy and perfect.  Then a plate of hand cut fries with the eggs. I don't know what they feed Spanish chickens so that they produce such delicious eggs? .. but please, Spain.. keep it up.  Finally (yes, the four of us managed to handle all this food, and slept like rocks afterward.. ) came a ""little chicken""- roasted and gorgeously juicy, stuffed with rice and dried fruit and what seemed like a bit of liver (awesome), over a few more fries with some lovely juicy gravy.  We had a lovely bottle of dessert wine (they have a great wine selection), and then split two desserts between us.. a chocolate lava-ey gooey insane item, and a lovely lighter vanilla-ey cheesecakey cake.  All this, including the Tinto de Verano we were all drinking before we began and throughout the meal, set us back around 20 euros each. A bargain at half the price, and I'm not embarrassed to say that we stopped in again the following night.... and have a reservation for this evening as well ;)  I haven't been for lunch, but am told by my friend that you can have a great lunch for around 10 euros.

We were booked in by our hotel after asking them for recommendations in the area, their other recommendations were great, but this place was well short of acceptable. The staff are rude and condescending and are so inattentive they may as well not be there, but their mediocreness was excelled by the disgustingly overpriced garbage they serve to customers. After two forks of my main (the lamb, you might want to avoid) I gave up, it was cold bland and had the look and texture of something reheated in a microwave. We complained, staff not interested, but as my wife hated her main too (identical dish - at least they are consistent in being bad) they offered my daughter a free desert, which you guessed it was garbage too. Bill came to 140 euro and it was only after they ignored us for so long I got up to walk out that they finally brought a the card machine over!

Everything we ordered from the menu were, in our opinion, the best sort of experience we look for - brininging together fresh ingredients in interesting and palate titillating ways. Nothing arrogant or pretentious, just great combinations that work. An example is the morcilla that came wrapped in a thin filo casing, fried and dressed in honey. Or soft, melt in your mouth artichokes covered in melting foie. There's a usual menu (helpfully translated into English on a facing page) and the daily specials, which you'd need some Spanish to understand. On our first visit, we didnt make any reservation and the waiter stood studying for a long time his table set-up trying his darnest to fit us in because we had arrived very early and waited patiently for the kitchen to open. On our 2nd visit, the two waiters, one of them the owner, recognized us and shook our hands as he walked in. For two obviously non-Spanish who have been feeling super out of place at every tapas bar we ate yet, this was a gesture that made us feel so welcomed. Place is small.

It is a former tavern which according to legend was once owned by Luis Candelas, Madrid's most famous bandit, who sold it to his close friend who is a baker by the name of Mollet. Therefore, in all bandillero tradition, Luis Candelas gave his friend a bandit's nickname ""El Mollete"" which later became the name of this place. This tiny atmospheric restaurant of only two floors is all wood beams with brick-stone walls centuries old. However the food is the main attraction as this is one of the best (if not the best) home cook tapas in Madrid at very reasonable prices. Everything on the menu is good (except only perhaps the house wine). However because it's so famous and yet so humble (this is not a restaurant with pretentious airs) most of its tables are always full. So if you fancy a sit down tapas-dinner, do call to book or show up punctually on time at 9 pm. any later than 9.30 pm means you will have to stick to the bar.  There is a brief English menu translation from the Spanish menu but if you know Spanish, then it's easier (and recommendable) to try the house's daily specials which the waiter will recite for you.",2012-03-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1728085-Reviews-or100-El_Mollete-Madrid.html,UID_373,0.009,0.921,0.069,0.8949,0.1892735042735042,0.3955982905982906,0.2767,1201,106,0.0882597835137385,0,34,False,38,0.1111111111111111,0.1388888888888889,0.3333333333333333,0.0555555555555555,0.1666666666666666,0.0,0.0555555555555555,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0277777777777777,220,153,4.459090909090909,0,0,discov tapa place chanc discoveri former tavern accord legend own lui candela madrid famou bandit sold close friend baker name mollet therefor bandillero tradit lui candela gave friend bandit nicknam el mollet later becam name place tini atmospher restaur two floor wood beam brick stone wall centuri old howev food main attract one best best home cook tapa madrid reason price everyth menu good except perhap hous wine howev famou yet humbl restaur pretenti air tabl alway full fanci sit tapa dinner call book show punctual time pm later pm mean stick bar brief english menu translat spanish menu know spanish easier recommend tri hous daili special waiter recit,good review,4

We requested a 10:00 table but were told we could do 9:00. Of course when we turned up at 9:00 we were the only people there (as we suspected). So we had a quiet hour to enjoy the personal service of the owner and sample all the yummy dishes he suggested. The place is cozy and attractive. Its a red checker tablecloth type place but the walls and floor are exposed stone and that is pretty cool. There are two levels and both are fairly small so its an intimate spot. We had about 6 different plates that the friendly owner suggested and delivered and they were each delicious with only one exception and in fact it was the one thing he had not suggested. It was the squid and it was kind of gross. Way over salted and a bit ""soft"" and cold. We had 2 bottles of the house white wine which was obviously nice or we would not have had two bottles...and the bill came to 75 euros! We were pleasantly shocked. By the time we left around 10:45 the place was rocking with what appreared to be mostly locals as the owner was greeting many of them like long lost friends.

Other than that I wouldn’t consider Wellies AT ALL a Japanese restaurant. Actually I would say it had more Italian-like dishes... The only thing that’s the same from some of the reviews is a) quite expensive b) service kind of lame c) they do nickel and dime you on EVERYTHING and d) food fairly good after getting our order right.  I’m giving them two stars because of two reasons - My daughter’s Chicken Milanese was totally RAW. Not just pink- 100% raw. She took a few bites it knowing & then we called the waitstaff over - not so much as an apology. S a matter of fact they kind of acted like it was an imposition to have to COOK her chicken. We thought maybe they’d consider giving us something for the grossness but not even a comment about it.  Then we got the bill & they had a charge of course for the raw chicken fiasco, for the bowl of olives we didn’t ask for AND a charge for the three individual pieces of bread THEY OFFERED.. Even had the audacity to list the chefs taster at the beginning with ‘ no charge’ like we should be soooooooooooooo lucky to not have to pay for something we didn’t ask for in the first place. Other reviewers mentioned the same thing - whatever, we had to pay extra for all of these items and we’ll live, but it sure leaves a terrible taste in your mouth when you feel like you’re getting screwed.

The large shrimp were tender and delicious and the sauce was so good we could have sopped it all up with our nice warm bread. But we resisted. We each had on his recommendation a spiced lamb dish and a chicken dish. Both slow cooked with vegetables, each like a stew but the flavours were still bright and clean.

The mixed paella was tasty with a fairly good amount of seafood. But it is cooked in a large batch and is served to you quickly when you order. So it is missing some of the crusty flavor of paella cooked individually in a pan. We also had the mixed grill of meats. Most were good except that the chorizo was extremely salty, and the pork belly was extremely chewy that we did not eat most of it. But chicken was soft and tasty. Ribs were good too. We also ordered some additional pork ribs. The meat itself was tasty but it is cooked quickly with sauce lathered on. It does not fall off the bone like we expect ribs to be in the U.S.  All in all, good value for a hearty meal without big budget. 4 of us eat well for less than €40.",2015-07-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d990632-Reviews-or150-Venta_El_Buscon-Madrid.html,UID_18259,0.017,0.831,0.152,0.9748,0.2351948051948051,0.5284199134199133,0.4199076923076922,860,85,0.0988372093023255,0,19,False,40,0.1111111111111111,0.1428571428571428,0.2539682539682539,0.1269841269841269,0.1904761904761904,0.0158730158730158,0.0317460317460317,0.0317460317460317,0.0634920634920634,0.0317460317460317,170,108,4.0588235294117645,0,0,good meal good price portion gener albeit food would necessarili rave mix paella tasti fairli good amount seafood cook larg batch serv quickli order miss crusti flavor paella cook individu pan also mix grill meat good except chorizo extrem salti pork belli extrem chewi eat chicken soft tasti rib good also order addit pork rib meat tasti cook quickli sauc lather fall bone like expect rib u good valu hearti meal without big budget us eat well less,good review,4

I wanted to give it a try to this restaurant after reading so much about it. So just after worked, I came straight here to the restaurant to get my dinner . I strongly suggest to book well in advanced even though the orders go fast and there's a pretty fast reshuffle of tables . The venue is great. Being in the centre of Madrid with only few steps from ""plaza Del sol "" already gives a good atmosphere of the place and puts you in a good mood.  This is indeed a Good old restaurant and it's cute the idea of those two pictures of the memorable ancient characters painted on the walls with their background faded away giving an extra touch of an old tavern letting you think of the times of the thousand meals consumed here across centuries. It almost gave me the goosebumps .  So I was then ready for my order . Three plates out of the menu and the waitress, kind and nice, went against his interest by suggesting to reducing the selections because my portions were going to be big and very generous.  Well, I tried my luck and I sticked to my choices and went anyway for salty grilled green peppers, Deep fried spicy chilly shrimps and potatoes and meat croquettes along a couple of local beers, so called ""canas"". Well, it was all delicious . Served quickly to the table . Food was tasty and indeed each single plate was very generous.  All of the above was not that expensive after all . Paying 26€ for a full tasty meal in a characteristic restaurant in the heart of Madrid wasn't bad at all.  I suggest you all to give it a try .

This restaurant alone made our decision to return to Madrid an easy one. Consistently delicious food. Always fresh. The owner, Ramiro and his two sons run the floor and his wife runs the kitchen.

We have yet to find a place with this price point, selection, and overall experience.  What I will tell you is that certain days of the week they offer a certain specialty dish. E.g., Thursday and Sunday, they offer paella valenciana. Monday is roast lamb day. Etc. Too much offered to write it all down. Know that we ate their 4 times this week and each time left in awe.

It is a simple, old stlye, unpretentious restaurant. Asides from the basic decor, I cannot find one single thing to fault. The choice of dishes on the fixed menu is as good as most a la carte restaurants. 8 or ten options in each section. Home made, traditional, simple Spanish recipes. The portions are very large, so go to the restaurant with a good appetite. We had, mushrooms and sausage for starter, spaghetti, posto with egg(my favourite) and tempura eggplant. All very tasty. For mains we had veal, steak, and seabass. The deserts, which are normally a letter down on a fixed menu, were really good. Not fancy or elaborate, but homely and wholesome, apple cake, and Santiago cake, delicious custard (natillas), stewed pear in wine... All for 15 euro a head! Incredibile.

The atmosphere was quite flat and the air temperature unbearably hot in the basement. The waiter was offhand and condescending and seemed to feel he was doing us a favour. The starters/amuse Bouche were tasty but very large affecting our appetite for the main course. One of our party ordered lamb shoulder. It was meant to be slow roasted but seemed to have been boiled and was devoid of all flavour and the texture was rubbery. The saffron couscous was grey and unappetising and tasteless. When our friends dissatisfaction was politely raised it took several attempts to persuade the waiter to speak to the chef. The waiter had to be asked about the response and he simply shrugged and said the chef said it was a matter of taste. We left feeling that our evening had been really disappointing...not just as a result of  Mediocre food but mainly the lack of gracious response from the staff. The cost was not insignificant compared to other more modest but good quality restaurants in Madrid. This restaurant is not to be recommended and needs to look closely at its service attitudes and the quality of the food they provide.,2015-10-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or120-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_35317,0.048,0.842,0.109,0.9219,-0.0164786967418546,0.4582080200501253,0.3554454545454545,1210,111,0.0917355371900826,0,16,False,35,0.0588235294117647,0.0980392156862745,0.2156862745098039,0.0392156862745098,0.1764705882352941,0.0784313725490196,0.0588235294117647,0.0196078431372549,0.1764705882352941,0.0784313725490196,210,130,4.761904761904762,0,0,book restaur basi review disappoint atmospher quit flat air temperatur unbear hot basement waiter offhand condescend seem feel us favour starter amus bouch tasti larg affect appetit main cours one parti order lamb shoulder meant slow roast seem boil devoid flavour textur rubberi saffron couscou grey unappetis tasteless friend dissatisfact polit rais took sever attempt persuad waiter speak chef waiter ask respons simpli shrug said chef said matter tast left feel even realli disappoint result mediocr food mainli lack graciou respons staff cost insignific compar modest good qualiti restaur madrid restaur recommend need look close servic attitud qualiti food provid,very bad review,1

The owner and our waiter spoke some English and did not mind my attempts at Spanish. Luckily my wife is fluent, which helped as they didn't have an English menu.

We ordered the salad and paella for starter and the steak and patatas for main but we're so full after the starters that we struggled.  The salad was huge and came with tuna and egg, the paella was tasty, albeit a bit salty.  The steak was large, well cooked (rare for me) and came with loads of roasted peppers and chips which I didn't need as I was sharing my OH's patatas bravas. The sauces with the patatas were not great - not very fresh, from a jar I suspect.  We left a lot of food which I don't like doing, the waiter could've mentioned that the amount of food we ordered was too much for two people. I didn't like wasting the money or the food.

Out front was a sign that had a ""Menu del Dia"" for 14.75 Euros (including all taxes) that had a large number of choices on the menu. We went inside where there were several tables with white linen tablecloths and were greeted by a very friendly waiter. We knew it was a restaurant that catered to locals since nobody spoke English, and none of the other diners looked like tourists like us. But the staff were very helpful and considerate. In addition to the menu items we were served a bowl of olives and a basket of bread. The menu consisted of a starter, a main course, a dessert and drink. My wife had a half bottle of very good Spanish red wine. I had the local beer, which was also very good. I opted for the Paella Valencia, which was a seafood/chicken/rice dish, which was wonderful. My wife had the Castilian (ham) soup which was also very good. Next I had the Rabbit with Garlic and my wife had the grilled lamb chops. Both were very good and came with fried potatoes. For dessert, I had the Tarta de Queso con Arandanos (blueberry cheesecake) and had a side of homemade vanilla ice cream with raspberry sauce. It was awesome. My wife had the homemade Flan with whipped cream and carmel sauce. The whipped cream was the best we ever had.

On the last day we visited and had our final tapas meal. Probably one of the best of our few days in Madrid! We did the Spanish thing and sat at the bar, went for a couple of drinks, red wine and a beer, our accompanying “tapa” consisted of some amazing oven baked chicken wings. Having looked at the menu we then ordered some “Patatas con trez bravas” Potatoes with 3 sauces –cheese alioli and spicy tomato, & some “Croquettas” which were ham and cheese, we got a basket of bread as well. More drinks and the whole lot came to not much! Around £10 I recall. Food quality was superb, perfecto in fact. Id say of the dozen or so establishments we visited, this was up there at the top. Service was great, we tried our best Spanish, the interior and décor was also superb, place really filled up after we had arrived around 2pm or so. Some of the food coming out looked amazing, they do a paella for 1 served in its own mini paella dish. My only regret is that it was our last day and we couldn’t return. Full of Spanish, a real great atmosphere and great value. If I go back to Madrid I will be sure to call in, together with visits to the other 2 tapas bars I also visited on the same street!

For those looking for gastronomic extravaganza and molecular fantasies, please do not enter ... Here waiters are joyful and it feels like being amongst friends that you know for years... Food is typical and authentic, in both taste and presentation. Decoration is magnificent and warm, and history is present... Even the menu in Art-Deco style adds up to the harmony of this nice little gem. And then there is the Spanish 'Cocina' with a nice choice of meat-and fish dishes, and tapas of course. We followed advice and had the 'Menu del dia' ( 3 course lunch, bread, one drink and some tapas for starters), added some bottles of wine (3, 4, last day may be 5?) and after ab. 3-4hrs we left.

I was surprised to see that the menu costed 17 euros per person, which I found too expensive for a food that was just ok.

I must say however that we had the best service of our trip in Spain. Staff is helpful, fun and friendly. Also...

In the end, I was disappointed - I think 3.5 out of 5 would be my more accurate rating. The menu offered a good choice that looked enticing however my choices did not really deliver. In both cases the dishes were overwhelmed by strong flavours that did not work with others on the plate. I started with duck fois gras, and the orange marmalade was the dominant flavour on the plate. I followed that with guinea fowl which was accompanied by a very rich sauce. The other point of note was that the amuses bouches were very large - and ultimately dampened our appetites. The gazpacho we were served first was a particularly large bowl! The wine list was good, and service was efficient. Our bill came to about 250 EUR for two, including a decent bottle of wine and coffee.

Their website made us really excited to go because the descriptions of dishes and the photos were great. When we arrived the table beside us were complaining about several things to the waiter and already we felt uncomfortable. The waiters were extremely rude and making faces behind their bosses back. The main course options were so minimal compared to their menu online and didnt meet our expectations. My main was shockingly bad. I got a tiny piece of sea bass, 5 TINY little potatoes - the size of grapes (i know, typical of gran canarias, but 5?) and 2 tiny slices of courgette. The whole plate was swimming in oil so the courgettes were inedible. I was left starving and the dish cost €33. The dessert was a creme brulee that was sickeningly sweet and overpriced. They forgot to bring our coffees. For 2 drinks, 2 mains, and one dessert it cost €101 and we left hungry and disappointed.

My partner and I dined there in late August the experience was mediocre and expensive. The food was good but not exceptional, and the service was risible.  In our reservation, we had noted that one of us doesn't eat fish or fowl. The first waiter we had mentioned that the staff had seen this. The second waiter brought in a complementary starter that had fish in it. We politely pointed out that one of us doesn't eat fish, and the waiter took the plate away and brought a vegetarian alternative. Fine. But the second complementary starter, brought in after we had finished the first one, also contained fish. This was set down in front of the non-fish eater by the same waiter. We reminded him that one of us doesn't eat fish. He took the plate away and made himself scarce. After waiting 10 minutes for him return with something, we called the waiter over and asked him what was happening, would the non-fish eater be getting something else? ""No"", the waiter answered ""it doesn't matter, the food you ordered will be coming in next"".  We demurred that it did matter. He went off in a huff and came back with a small bowl of lentil soup. Again, good food, but should one really have to argue with a waiter to get it?  This continued. We ordered a bottle of wine with our dinner. Only about 5 minutes after the main courses had arrived did the waiter come over to inform us that the restaurant was out of the wine we had ordered. At this point we were irritated and told him that it would have been nice if he had thought to mention this before our food had arrived. The waiter brought us two glasses of wine on the house, but he made a show of this, like he was doing us a special favor.  All in all the experience was regrettable. Especially at a price tag of €130. Also, know this: if you book a table, like we did, at 20.30, you will be seated together downstairs with a few non-Spanish tourists. Other reviews of this restaurant mention this and one should take it seriously. It is not particularly pleasant sitting in a near-empty restaurant with other tourists. It feels like a charter trip to the Canary Islands.",2014-08-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or180-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_35428,0.043,0.882,0.075,0.9252,0.05400690579262,0.4802656668728097,0.2698777777777778,2216,212,0.095667870036101,0,59,False,104,0.0862068965517241,0.1379310344827586,0.3103448275862069,0.0689655172413793,0.1551724137931034,0.0344827586206896,0.0172413793103448,0.0172413793103448,0.1206896551724138,0.0517241379310344,409,217,4.410757946210269,0,0,dine viridiana baffl mani review posit partner dine late august experi mediocr expens food good except servic risibl reserv note one us eat fish fowl first waiter mention staff seen second waiter brought complementari starter fish polit point one us eat fish waiter took plate away brought vegetarian altern fine second complementari starter brought finish first one also contain fish set front non fish eater waiter remind one us eat fish took plate away made scarc wait minut return someth call waiter ask happen would non fish eater get someth els waiter answer matter food order come next demur matter went huff came back small bowl lentil soup good food one realli argu waiter get continu order bottl wine dinner minut main cours arriv waiter come inform us restaur wine order point irrit told would nice thought mention food arriv waiter brought us two glass wine hous made show like us special favor experi regrett especi price tag also know book tabl like seat togeth downstair non spanish tourist review restaur mention one take serious particularli pleasant sit near empti restaur tourist feel like charter trip canari island,bad review,2

Foie gras + dessert wine - very good with beautiful serving(see photoes). Meat and fish dishes were of good quality and taste as well.

The restaurant is kind of outdated in many ways - the décor could some call it cozy but for my taste is dark and uninviting. Service is so-so at best - it is the type of restaurant that probably due to its past success forgot to be pleasant to customers, bordering on being arrogant. Best example of both things was a customer sitting at a table that the air conditioner hit him right in the head, making it very uncomfortable. The vent was the old ones that cannot be redirected, so after several complaints from the customer they decided to shut down the whole A/C. So when we got hot (according to the waiter own thermometer), they would turn it on again, to be followed by some more complaining and off again. That was how we spent the night, on, off, on and so on. Funny thing was that there were other tables available but they were ""reserved"" by some people that even after we left never showed up. At the end you could put up with this is the food was amazing but it wasn't. Was good, no question about that, but nothing so good to write home about it. So, good food with so-so service in an outdated place is nothing to really be excited about in a city that has so many great alternatives.",2015-07-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or140-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_31177,0.085,0.751,0.164,0.9802,0.2658380018674137,0.525233426704015,0.55985,1262,125,0.0990491283676703,0,32,False,38,0.1176470588235294,0.1764705882352941,0.2352941176470588,0.0980392156862745,0.1764705882352941,0.0784313725490196,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0784313725490196,0.0196078431372549,239,154,4.2845188284518825,0,0,use better restaur seem fallen sleep restaur kind outdat mani way cor could call cozi tast dark uninvit servic best type restaur probabl due past success forgot pleasant custom border arrog best exampl thing custom sit tabl air condition hit right head make uncomfort vent old one cannot redirect sever complaint custom decid shut whole c got hot accord waiter thermomet would turn follow complain spent night funni thing tabl avail reserv peopl even left never show end could put food amaz good question noth good write home good food servic outdat place noth realli excit citi mani great altern,bad review,2

The cooking is unmistakably traditional, although at a very high standard. If you expected liquid nitrogen and flavoured soil, then look elsewhere. Ironically, the cuisine appears at odds with the décor, which contains scenes from the 1961 film Viridiana and suggests a more playful and subversive vibe from a time slightly forgotten. However, the dishes are what I can describe only as the biased childhood memories of grandma’s cooking. Please do not read this in a bad way, the meals have a lovely smoky and rustic depth of flavour that is difficult to recreate. We had the game cannelloni and the veal as mains, and regretted nothing. The wine list is extensive, and very reasonable. We chose a lovely Ribera to accompany us. What really stood out was the experience of talking to the chef, Abraham. It is rare to start discussing Sashimi and to end with Kafka – but it reveals that there is more than meets the eye here.

FIRST NIGHT - Food -  For tapas (appetizers), we ordered croquetas de jamon iberico and paella. By the way, the paella was - hands down - the best paella I had in Spain. While on this trip, we visited five different cities and I made it a point to try paella in all of them but not one compared to Venta el Buscon's. As our main course, we ordered a seafood special for two (see picture). It included lobster tails and all kind of shrimp - DELICIOUS.  - Service -  The service was amazing. Manuel was our server for the night. We greeted us, treated us like regulars from the start and even gave us free drinks at the end of the night!  - Ambiance -  Venta El Buscon definitely has a bar/pub feel to it. Both nights it was crowded but the service felt far from rushed. We were able to enjoy our meal and conversation just fine.  SECOND NIGHT - Food -  For tapas, we ordered ham croquettes, paella (again, because delicious!) and chorizo. For our main course we ordered another special for two but this time all types of meat. Again, the good did not disappoint. - Service -  Here is when we got very annoyed. Manuel was so busy that night that he was another serve wait our table - Rodrigo. I was unsure whether Rodrigo was new on the job or just to the restaurant but he was quite rude. Listen, it is not every day you are in Spain (all the way from the States) so we ordered 3 tapas and 1 big main course. When we were about to order our main course, Rodrigo made a face and made the following off hand comment, ""you're going to keep ordering? I think you've ordered enough for the night."" This comment was rude on levels that I cannot even begin to explain. Simply put, it's our body, it's our MONEY so bring us all the food we order because we are going to PAY for it.

Eventually the magre de pato turned up and they realised they had forgotten the bread, so then they brought that. The pato was good, which made things a little better. However, the service was rather poor, and at 10 euro each the tapas were expensive. It's a tiny place, with the servicios to be found upstairs by squeezing past a table of customers.

The menu is based around many traditional Spanish dishes and the quality of the food and cooking is at the highest of standards - it may not be to some peoples' taste but it certainly does not merit some of the negative comments on here, which should be generally ignored since thankfully the positive outweigh the negative ones. As a couple we paid 209 euros for aperitif (glass of Cava) starters, main, cheese course, 1/2 bottle of wine & a traditional Spanish digestive (Aquardiente) - which we believe is not bad value for what we ate.

I didn't know the layout of the restaurant and didn't know that the restaurant has a small room on the ground floor and a larger basement with no windows. My Spanish friends said they dined at this restaurant many years ago when they had just a ground floor and when Viridiana was a top one in Madrid. We were advised to follow the waitress down to the basement and when I queried whether we could stay on the ground floor, the answer was short and straightforward that I didn't book the table on the ground floor. One would expect the manager to tell you about that when you book a table, and if you don't ask you have no choice but to follow the instructions.  We were the first to sit at our table as soon as the restaurant opens for dinner at 8:30pm and I was wondering whether the basement fills in. And it did! But I noticed they were similar parties like ours - foreigners with their Spanish friends or just English speaking tourists. I made a conclusion that if you don't speak Spanish and you don't know where you want to sit, you have no option. One of the guidelines of a good restaurant is a state of their toilets and these were appalling. Toilets in McDonalds on Gran Via are in better conditions than these dating back probably to 1980s. Service was invasive and patronising as if we were in a paramount of an eating place. Chef in his traditional outfit marched up and down the basement about five times in two hours. I actually wondered who was cooking for us as he has time to spend so much time in the hall. Except bread the food was mediocre, a disgrace for famous Spanish chefs.

No, it's not the kind of food that you would find in midwest America, but that's the point! It's unique; it's creative; but incredibly delicious and satisfying. The Gazpacho is utterly amazing and since tomatoes are a fruit, it's not such a stretch to add another fruit to it. So as not to fill up before my main arrived, I had to push back from the delicious bread with its crispy crust and soft center!

Before receiving our salad, we had the complimentary strawberry/seafood gazpacho. Contrary to another reviewer, we loved the soup, (however a small bowl is just enough). We also had the complementary Iberian ham and melon. The salad we shared and was plated for two people was a nopal (cactus) salad with tomato, anchovies, and zested orange. We loved it. My husband had the guinea fowl with a plum sauce and I had pork meat balls in a curry sauce with roasted peach slices. Both entrees were delicious. We topped it off with a great bottle of wine and mango and passion fruit for dessert. The chef came out and spoke to many of the patrons, however, I do not think he spoke English and therefore, he just motioned a ""hello"" to us and asked if everything was good.

Then we had the egg with mushroom sauce and truffles this was a great dish. I can't complain about it. I ordered the leg of lamb with couscous. The lamb was great, tender with a crunchy skin, the couscous was a dry afterthought. My husband had the steak that he enjoyed, huge and well cooked.

Abraham Garcia, the chef, has written at least three books. His kitchen has seen the likes of David Munoz (currently 3 star michelin holder in Madrid) and Ramon Freixa (2 star michelin) apprentice there and he continues to be inventive while retaining the flavors of his native Galicia. I will admit that if you don't speak Spanish you will miss out on his ""explanation"" of the day's specials and that is really something (even this native Spanish speaker had a hard time keeping up). But forget about all that and just enjoy the dishes. Other reviewers claim that the ""amuse buche"" and appetizers eclipsed the main course and I must sadly agree but there were two amuse buche and two appetizers so I guess four out of five is not bad. Highlights include the eggs with truffles, the deer and the sweetbreads. You have to search the wine menu for value because I did find the wine list expensive. I ended up with a Jumilla for $45E which is the most I paid for a bottle of wine in Spain. All told, for 4 people, after two amuse buche a piece, two appetizers for the table, four entrees, two glasses of cava to start, a bottle of wine and dessert (plus petit fours) the bill came to $307E, not cheap but less than half of what one would pay for a similar restaurant in the States.

More so than places we normally go, though we do indulge once in awhile. I think people will fall into two camps on Viridiana. Some will think that the menu is brilliantly creative, while others will find it a bit fussy. We tend to fall towards the latter. That said, the cooking itself is unquestionably top notch. Further, the service was absolutely flawless with a couple of exceptions early on when the head waiter, one of the finest waiters we have encountered in many a year, got pulled away to do seatings while in the middle of taking an order. The rest of the service staff was equally as professional, though not necessarily as genial as the head. Customers receive two dishes on the house: a parsnip soup with potatoes and ham, which was perfect in texture and taste, as well as a white pork with various side ingredients. The pork was an interesting concept, and the pickled cucumber was heavenly, but it seemed like a lot of effort for a fairly insignificant side dish. The 6 mushroom risotto was out of this world. One of the top 2 or 3 we have ever had. Plain and simple. A chick pea tortilla filled with Ropa Vieja was a very interesting concept, but very large portion coming on the heels of the house dishes and risotto. The tortilla itself was very light, and the Ropa Vieja avoided a lot of the extreme spicing or over-preparation one often finds in the dish. An accompanying baked apple was a nice though some what incongruous complement, but the cactus seemed a bit extraneous. A chocolate panacotta with berries was a perfect way to round out a very satisfying, though at times slightly precious, meal. Still, the best meal we had on our trip to Spain and very highly recommended if you have ""extra cash"" and can negotiate some of the culinary whims of the otherwise top chef kitchen.",2015-01-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or160-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_35493,0.02,0.832,0.148,0.9929,0.3058725868725869,0.5671196911196912,0.4316888888888889,1926,162,0.0841121495327102,0,41,False,63,0.1494252873563218,0.1264367816091954,0.3218390804597701,0.0344827586206896,0.1954022988505747,0.0459770114942528,0.0114942528735632,0.0229885057471264,0.057471264367816,0.0344827586206896,344,210,4.601744186046512,0,0,friend madrid suggest restaur carri around extra cash ye quit expens place normal go though indulg awhil think peopl fall two camp viridiana think menu brilliantli creativ other find bit fussi tend fall toward latter said cook unquestion top notch servic absolut flawless coupl except earli head waiter one finest waiter encount mani year got pull away seat middl take order rest servic staff equal profession though necessarili genial head custom receiv two dish hous parsnip soup potato ham perfect textur tast well white pork variou side ingredi pork interest concept pickl cucumb heavenli seem like lot effort fairli insignific side dish mushroom risotto world one top ever plain simpl chick pea tortilla fill ropa vieja interest concept larg portion come heel hous dish risotto tortilla light ropa vieja avoid lot extrem spice prepar one often find dish accompani bake appl nice though incongru complement cactu seem bit extran chocol panacotta berri perfect way round satisfi though time slightli preciou meal still best meal trip spain highli recommend extra cash negoti culinari whim otherwis top chef kitchen,good review,4

It is small and cozy and they are not fluent in English but it was not a problem. We were made to feel so welcome with complimentary Gazpacho with red herring Unbelievable flavour. Each course for the three of us kept getting better, we ate far more that usual but were not sorry. The house wine was more than acceptable.

There were 5 of us in the group and for the most part we enjoyed our meals. Expect a more classic cuisine that is unpretentious. It evokes elevated homecooking, which is not a bad thing. Don't expect liquid nitrogen, foams, and molecular gastronomy. This is not the restaurant's mission. They give you an amuse bouche and an appetizer for starters--to our surprise. The servings were quite generous so they filled me up. By the time my shrimp fideo appetizer arrived, I was on the verge of fullness. I did not get to finish it because the serving was also quite generous. The fideo was disappointing, quite on the salty side, and unexciting (I had better). Next came my squid dish in black ink with green jasmine rice and vegetable concasse on the side. The dish was simple, but it delivered.  My colleagues loved their food - guinea fowl with the most delicious mole (I had a taste); a beef dish with vegetables (simple but rich in flavor). We didn't order dessert as we were beyond full. However, you will be rewarded with coconut macaroon balls and melt-in-your-mouth dark chocolate truffles for petit fours.",2014-09-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or170-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_24687,0.009,0.83,0.161,0.9874,0.2511363636363635,0.5491341991341993,0.41804,1228,98,0.0798045602605863,0,42,False,31,0.0980392156862745,0.196078431372549,0.2745098039215686,0.0392156862745098,0.1372549019607843,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0588235294117647,0.0784313725490196,0.0784313725490196,211,152,4.819905213270142,0,0,small intim beauti restaur chef roam around greet guest introduc special day us group part enjoy meal expect classic cuisin unpretenti evok elev homecook bad thing expect liquid nitrogen foam molecular gastronomi restaur mission give amus bouch appet starter surpris serv quit gener fill time shrimp fideo appet arriv verg full get finish serv also quit gener fideo disappoint quit salti side unexcit better next came squid dish black ink green jasmin rice veget concass side dish simpl deliv colleagu love food guinea fowl delici mole tast beef dish veget simpl rich flavor order dessert beyond full howev reward coconut macaroon ball melt mouth dark chocol truffl petit four,good review,4

Because I thought after reading the reviews that maybe it was people in the midwest that weren't used to cutting edge food and didn't appreciate it. I was so wrong. This is the type of restaurant that your grandparents would love, thinking that they were really cool for finding it. Because you know, things served on chargers and plate covers taken of with a flourish in front of you make up for the food. The food is average at best and for a price tag of about 200 Euros for a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees, I expected better and I'm fine with paying that if I get something quality and interesting. We had a far superior meal at La Vega Del Arte for only 60 Euros and couldn't believe the flavors there. We enjoyed the amuse bouches at Viridiana much more than the actual apps and entrees that we ordered. The gazpacho with the fish and fruit was actually interesting and tasty (but this was an amuse not a menu item). This place is about presentation, the interior was well decorated, the food was plated attractively and the service was attentive. The flavors and price tag? not worth it.",2014-09-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d797208-Reviews-or170-Viridiana-Madrid.html,UID_35497,0.034,0.831,0.135,0.9653,0.2412698412698412,0.5880952380952381,0.4596727272727273,1170,111,0.0948717948717948,0,24,False,43,0.0476190476190476,0.1666666666666666,0.4047619047619047,0.0,0.1428571428571428,0.0238095238095238,0.0714285714285714,0.0238095238095238,0.0952380952380952,0.0238095238095238,217,141,4.3963133640553,0,0,wast one dinner madrid place thought read review mayb peopl midwest use cut edg food appreci wrong type restaur grandpar would love think realli cool find know thing serv charger plate cover taken flourish front make food food averag best price tag euro bottl wine appet entre expect better fine pay get someth qualiti interest far superior meal la vega del art euro believ flavor enjoy amus bouch viridiana much actual app entre order gazpacho fish fruit actual interest tasti amus menu item place present interior well decor food plate attract servic attent flavor price tag worth,average review,3
