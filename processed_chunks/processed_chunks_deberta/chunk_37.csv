You can phone and your take-out will be waiting when you pick it up within minutes. We have walked up to the street window and not had a long wait until the pizza was ready. Medium to smallish-sized pizzas cost 6 to 9 euros (truly a reasonable value). If you're watching you're figure you can probably share one or at least order just one, but most of us hogs require more than something to share. We have visited mid-week, sat at the counter, and had a great time watching the bustling staff prepare the pizzas and other food. Soon we found ourselves chatting with our pleasant and welcoming Brazilian waitress who was way cool. My spouse and I shared a mixed salad, a tasty pizza, a better than expected lasagna, and mostly we just inhaled our bottle of good chianti.

Having been worried we would not get a table we arrived early and were the first to be seated (aside from what I presume to be the owner and an associate). The restaurant was very cute and pretty cool and our table overlooked the pizza prep area and ovens. There was one waiter and one cook and our order was taken promptly.  We ordered a cocktail each which took as long to make as the pizza. The pizza, although full of promise from the reviews and the unusual range on the menu was disappointing, a bit sloppy and not much flavour.  We passed a couple of other pizza places very close by and wish we had chosen to eat at one of those. Lovely little restaurant but doesn’t deliver.

Then I read the reviews here and decided to give it a try and, boy, was I sorry not to have tried it earlier! It feels pretty intimate, when you stay at the bar and you see the staff behind it kneading dough and preparing your pizza. They're pretty friendly and greet you with a smile, they don't seem eager to throw you out because there is a crowd inside. The pizza was absolutely delicious both times I've tried it - not too puffy, not to slim and dry, well covered in topping. The pasta was also good, a real home-made feel to it.

At spanish dining time it's really packed up, and it's not easy find a place to sit (or stand). You can also have a takeaway food, so you wouldn't mess inside. Really quick and easy fix, if you don't want to hassle with spanish language menus and just want to have something internationally named, this is a perfect place.

What a great choice. The restaurant is small, intimate and feels as though you are seated in the owner's dining room (albeit one that appeared to accommodate about 12 or so tables). After explaining why we had chosen to eat here, the staff laid out a splendid spread of Spanish delicacies all savory, perfectly prepared and delicious. We sampled one fish and one lamb entree, numerous side dishes and at one bottle of house-recommended Rioja, which was tasty and went well with all of the food. As is the custom here, after we politely declined dessert lacking the capacity, the staff brought out with our coffee a large sample of candies, cookies and shots of Lemoncello. We spent less than $100 euro and could not top the experience over the next six days. Definitely worth trying, especially if authentic cuisine is the experience you desire.",2012-01-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1496002-Reviews-or490-El_Rincon_de_Esteban-Madrid.html,UID_31457,0.014,0.825,0.161,0.9834,0.2348809523809523,0.4747619047619048,0.5099571428571429,1069,83,0.0776426566884939,0,25,False,39,0.1025641025641025,0.2051282051282051,0.4102564102564102,0.0256410256410256,0.1794871794871795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0769230769230769,0.0,182,135,4.87912087912088,0,0,read earlier review elsewher doubl check inclin help concierg trek el rincon de esteban first seriou meal recent holiday madrid great choic restaur small intim feel though seat owner dine room albeit one appear accommod tabl explain chosen eat staff laid splendid spread spanish delicaci savori perfectli prepar delici sampl one fish one lamb entre numer side dish one bottl hous recommend rioja tasti went well food custom polit declin dessert lack capac staff brought coffe larg sampl candi cooki shot lemoncello spent less euro could top experi next six day definit worth tri especi authent cuisin experi desir,good review,4

The nice hotel nearby recommended it when their restaurant was also closed. As we were walking in the waiter had stopped a couple who were at the door as the boss wanted to give the lady a flower before leaving. it set the tone for the whole evening. A lovely older gentleman seated us in a little table in the corner. He was so warm it was like being served by family, he recommended the house red and used some english with us while we tried to use our spanish. He checked if we wanted the marinated anchovies laid out as a starter but we declined so they were removed and olives and the tastiest mini chorizos brought instead. He gave us a candle as he said we were young romantics and needed it more than the older group beside us. He also topped us both up, if ones glass ran lower than the other he still topped you both, adding a splash to the second. you wanted for nothing, yet not intrusive either. We had the chefs pate to start, very nice. Duck with Pomegranate jam and orange. Mains we had the steak with veg and fries. The meat was very good, mine was a little fatty but my husbands was not, it didnt matter though as i couldnt manage it all anyway. For pudding we had the creme catalan, a richer version of creme brule, fantastic, dont think of the calories just enjoy. Aftwards we had a small shot of a digestive liquor, it looks like lemoncelo but be warned its not it far stronger and our waiter thought it funny to top us up again.  Lastly he gave us a pen each as a gift, so lovely, the warmest service, really he saw us out to the door and wished us all the best. I would most definately return here on any trip to Madrid. It makes for a lovely quiet and relaxing romantic evening.",2012-01-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1496002-Reviews-or490-El_Rincon_de_Esteban-Madrid.html,UID_31458,0.024,0.776,0.2,0.9972,0.227156862745098,0.4638725490196079,0.5129888888888889,1770,166,0.0937853107344632,0,33,False,61,0.1538461538461538,0.1153846153846153,0.1666666666666666,0.141025641025641,0.1153846153846153,0.0384615384615384,0.0256410256410256,0.0384615384615384,0.0769230769230769,0.1282051282051282,339,208,4.221238938053097,0,0,visit restaur sunday night casani close nice hotel nearbi recommend restaur also close walk waiter stop coupl door boss want give ladi flower leav set tone whole even love older gentleman seat us littl tabl corner warm like serv famili recommend hous red use english us tri use spanish check want marin anchovi laid starter declin remov oliv tastiest mini chorizo brought instead gave us candl said young romant need older group besid us also top us one glass ran lower still top ad splash second want noth yet intrus either chef pate start nice duck pomegran jam orang main steak veg fri meat good mine littl fatti husband didnt matter though couldnt manag anyway pud creme catalan richer version creme brule fantast dont think calori enjoy aftward small shot digest liquor look like lemoncelo warn far stronger waiter thought funni top us lastli gave us pen gift love warmest servic realli saw us door wish us best would defin return trip madrid make love quiet relax romant even,good review,4

(Oddly, when we returned to Madrid a week later, it was also recommended by our travel agent.) We were welcomed by the maitre'd and the wait staff made us feel right at home.

When you are looking for a place to wind down and enjoy a solid leisurely meal this is it. We would return without hesitation. The only caveat I would add for all Spanish restaurants and not just this one, is beware what is brought to you at your table that you may think is complimentary. Odds are, it isn't. Olives, bread, potatos bravatas, and an after dinner drink can all add to your bill. Other than that this is a stop well worth making.

We were surrounded by locals, one a rather large group and the others smaller tables for two. While we did have several things delivered to our table that we did not order, we were only charged for a plate of large tasty olives and pickles. There was an amuse-bouche brought to the table before our meal and we had a glass of liquor poured after our meal that were not charged to us. This restaurant's recommendations came from several sources, our young hotel desk clerk told us she and their staff held its annual holiday party there. A couple of friends who are long-term Madrid residents recommended it as well. My dining companion and I both had fish dishes that were extraordinary in freshness and preparation. The hake was perfectly cooked. The large flakes of moist fish were mellow and delicately flavored. My friend had a sole prepared to her liking as well.

It was so nice to duck into this Taberna for a bite to eat. I read previous reviews on TripAdvisor and decided to stop by one early evening before the major dinner rush around 7pm. The establishment appears small yet it is very deep. I was able to find a high-top table near the the door and others were either escorted to the bar or back room. Although small, many groups dined here and everyone appeared to have a great time.  Hungry, I ordered 3 tapas in Spanish then waited for about 10 minutes before my first plate arrived. Worth. The. Wait! After the first three I ordered two more. Here's what I ate: - croquetas de jamón - Palitos de verdura (veggie sticks) - pollo crujiente (crispy chicken) - solomillo teriyaqui (teriyaki beef) - ceviche de langostinos y mango (prawn and mango ceviche) - two refresco limons I really stuffed myself and in hindsight I could've ordered less because the food was very hearty. The chef really focused on each individual tapa, pulling out the natural flavor of each of the ingredients all for a highly reasonable price. I felt like a queen feasting on a table full of delights. The vegetable sticks were a pleasant surprise. Upon arrival, I noticed they were lightly fried in batter and almost all of the dishes had some sort of ""base"", whether rice (beef teriyaki), potato chips (croquetas), a sweet or savory sauce, or salad. This was of no concern because everything blended well together.  If I ever have the opportunity to visit Madrid again you'd better believe I'm stopping here for a bite to eat!",2018-01-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3476797-Reviews-or50-Taberna_del_Chato-Madrid.html,UID_31482,0.026,0.844,0.13,0.9866,0.1829545454545454,0.4753535353535353,0.2936117647058823,1628,121,0.0743243243243243,3,53,False,60,0.1219512195121951,0.1219512195121951,0.3170731707317073,0.073170731707317,0.0975609756097561,0.048780487804878,0.0,0.073170731707317,0.1463414634146341,0.0,288,202,4.649305555555555,0,0,word describ place incred delici nice duck taberna bite eat read previou review tripadvisor decid stop one earli even major dinner rush around pm establish appear small yet deep abl find high top tabl near door other either escort bar back room although small mani group dine everyon appear great time hungri order tapa spanish wait minut first plate arriv worth wait first three order two ate croqueta de jam n palito de verdura veggi stick pollo crujient crispi chicken solomillo teriyaqui teriyaki beef cevich de langostino mango prawn mango cevich two refresco limon realli stuf hindsight could order less food hearti chef realli focus individu tapa pull natur flavor ingredi highli reason price felt like queen feast tabl full delight veget stick pleasant surpris upon arriv notic lightli fri batter almost dish sort base whether rice beef teriyaki potato chip croqueta sweet savori sauc salad concern everyth blend well togeth ever opportun visit madrid better believ stop bite eat,good review,4

For some people this could be a tad too much (he came to our table 3 times), but all in all it was fine by us. Food was very good although my suckling pig was not up there to what I expected, but everybody else loved their food so I go with majority. The menu is traditional Spanish, and by that I mean from Spain proper. Location is excellent by The Palace, Urban and Villa Real hotels and by the Congress so you are in the center of Madrid.

And lots of people will be waiting behind your back to have your seat. The place is so small and crowded that it is almost impossible to take the attention of the staff. And unfortunately they do not speak English.  Despite being such a small place, pizza menu/list is simple but rich at the same time. Pizza is freshly made and you see how it is done. You can choose what to include and what not to include. Prices are affordable/low (around 6 euros if I am not wrong). I would recommend you to have additional cheese and basil (with additional prices) on your pizza to make it even more delicious. We have tried 3 different pizzas, 1 spagetti and salad which unexpectedly turned out to be pasta salad! I can suggest you not to try spagetti and pasta salad but I guess you will not regret any of the pizzas you will try.

We were near Sorolla Museum in a very quiet street. We were tempted to go in for a quick pick, but decided it might take a while to find a cab to take us to Lakasa. We waited a while and got lucky as the cab took us to the area near the restaurant. I noticed in Spain, the cabbies sometimes drop you off in the area that is close to your destination. We were the only non Spanish diners. There was one very nice staff member that spoke English and took care of us. I guess they don’t get that many tourists, because at the end he came over and thanked us for dining there. How refreshing is that? One big advantage about this restaurant was the fact that you could order many of their dishes in half portion. That way you can try a few things. Even the half portions were generous. we had: Coca de trigueros y setas con jugo de leche Green asparagus and mushroom tart with sheep’s milk juice We started with this very delicious and spring-y dish. The grassy asparagus was the perfect partner for the earthy delicious morel mushrooms. The egg added richness to this wonderful dish. When was the last time you were served morel mushrooms in a restaurant that didn’t cost an arm and a leg? Spanish are lucky. Garbanzos con carabinero Chickpea Stew with Red Shrimp As soon as I saw my beloved red shrimp listed on this dish, I was sold. I love chickpeas and this was such a comfort dish. The shrimp was cooked beautifully. Bacalao con crema de ajonegro con verduritas a la vainilla Cod confit with black garlic sauce and vegetables scented with vanilla This was an interesting dish. The cod was cooked medium rare and the vanilla and black garlic added sweetness to this dish. The veggies provided a little textural contrast to the dish. Presa de cerdo ibérico puro de bellota con verduras encurtidas y Comté Grilled Iberian pork, pickled veggies and Comté cheese The best was saved for last. The only problem with that was we were kind of full, but that didn’t stop us from enjoying this wonderful dish. The Iberian pork and Comté was umami marriage made in heaven. Fruta con yogurt After all that food we needed something light and healthy. The juicy, sweet fruit and the tart yogurt was a perfect ending.

There are, of course, daily specials which are printed out. The wine list includes an excellent selection of Spanish and foreign wines, at very reasonable prices. Service is attentive and professional and, as noted in another review, the chef himself is the one who answers questions about the menu items, and takes orders.

Given the really cheap prices, this place is always packed (and I mean literally always). Whether there’s rain or shine and whether it’s lunchtime or dinnertime by Spanish or international standards, finding a seat here is usually pretty hard (and I say seat because this place mostly functions as a bar and only has high stools for sitting down with no actual tables available). Additionally, they’re always taking orders for takeaway pizzas, which only complicates things more and makes the waiting time a bit long. Nevertheless, the pizzas are usually worth it, especially when you’re feeling particularly cold, hungry, or both, and are in serious need of some comfort food. Don’t expect anything grand, however, as the pizzas happen to be fairly small and also use really cheap ingredients, for not only is the cheese really average quality, but they use canned mushrooms instead of fresh ones. While I can understand their choice to use cheaper cheese, the canned mushrooms definitely seem to be a bit excessive to me since white mushrooms are usually readily available all-year round and don’t cost much at all.

Both times the food was great but the last visit for dinner on Saturday 28th May was special - they had no printed English menu (just a selection on an ipad) so the chef came out & talked us through the menu making a number of recommendations which we accepted. He then recommended a bottle of wine (usually dangerous as you get ripped off) which amazingly was only €20!.

The restaurant has the option to serve most of its dishes as half portions to have a more tapas like experience. This is what my wife and I elected to do. We started with the Idiazabal Cheese Fritters. These soft gooey balls exploded with warm cheesy goodness and were insanely addictive. Next we had the Deep Fried Shrimps with Lime Mayonese. These shrimps were lightly crisp and airy and paired nicely with the creamy lime mayonese. Next up was the Cured Cow Meat from Astorga with a Touch of Pepper. This rich and flavorful cured meat had a pleasant salty and smokiness. Next we had the Grilled Duck Foie with Sweet Truffle. The Foie was creamy and lightly toasted and topped with savory mushroom shavings. The Marinated Loin of Bonito with Tomato Sauce & Cherry Tomato was also amazing. The melt in your mouth fish was paired nicely with juicy tomatoes. The Roast Pork with Homemade Mole Sauce was next. The tender pork had a nicely crisp outside and topped with a flavorful and spicy mole sauce and crisp tortilla chips. Next we had a cheese selection featuring four cheeses and jams from different areas of Europe. The cheeses had a variety of enjoyable flavors and textures. Finally, we couldn’t decide what to order for dessert, so we ordered three. The first dessert was the Lemon Pie with Meringue & Crumble which was lemony tart, creamy and filled with crunchy graham pieces. The second was the Crème Caramel made with Sheep’s Milk, which was a creamy sweet flan. Finally we had the Double Choco (Black & White). This dessert was chocolate bliss: creamy and rich with a nice sweetness and bitterness. Every dish we had was perfect! Overall, the food was exceptional and flavorful and Lakasa is a must visit when in Madrid.",2018-10-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2715774-Reviews-or20-Restaurante_lakasa-Madrid.html,UID_8317,0.008,0.838,0.155,0.994,0.2329365079365079,0.5146825396825397,0.4398347826086957,1779,132,0.0741989881956155,1,35,False,43,0.1041666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.25,0.0833333333333333,0.2291666666666666,0.0208333333333333,0.0208333333333333,0.0,0.1041666666666666,0.0208333333333333,310,185,4.741935483870968,0,0,dine lakasa phenomen experi restaur option serv dish half portion tapa like experi wife elect start idiazab chees fritter soft gooey ball explod warm cheesi good insan addict next deep fri shrimp lime mayones shrimp lightli crisp airi pair nice creami lime mayones next cure cow meat astorga touch pepper rich flavor cure meat pleasant salti smoki next grill duck foie sweet truffl foie creami lightli toast top savori mushroom shave marin loin bonito tomato sauc cherri tomato also amaz melt mouth fish pair nice juici tomato roast pork homemad mole sauc next tender pork nice crisp outsid top flavor spici mole sauc crisp tortilla chip next chees select featur four chees jam differ area europ chees varieti enjoy flavor textur final decid order dessert order three first dessert lemon pie meringu crumbl lemoni tart creami fill crunchi graham piec second cr caramel made sheep milk creami sweet flan final doubl choco black white dessert chocol bliss creami rich nice sweet bitter everi dish perfect overal food except flavor lakasa must visit madrid,very good review,5

It was a great recommendation ! We were impressed sufficiently after having lunch there when arriving in Spain, to returning for dinner at the end of our trip when leaving Spain. The meals are substantial and this is an authentic Spanish dining experience so its a good idea to have a healthy appetite before arriving. We tried various Spanish dishes including suckling pig and were not disappointed. There were a number of small complimentary items provided to us which were not part of the cost of the meal and this added to our enjoyment (and waistline). The menu is designed to have shared plates which was an added bonus and the cost is not excessive for the quality and quantity of what is provided to diners.

We had no reservation, and we were, well, casually dressed, but we were welcomed in and our damp raincoats whisked away. My wife's Spanish is a bit rusty, but we didn't actually need it. We started with a terrific bottle of white wine (we asked for a recommendation) that was on the lower end of the price range at 24 euros (the range was 13-98). We shared three tapa plates,including the best octopus I have ever had, anywhere on the globe - and I mean ANYWHERE. It was so good I can't even remember the third one (but I do remember terrific croquetas).  Service was attentive and unintrusive, and we were surprised when we realized how late it was and saw we were the last guests left.

We were the only 'touristy' family with our 2 children and casual clothes, while the rest of the crowd were all business/office types in their fierce suits; my teenage son was understandably a bit worried about eating here. But the genial elderly gentleman who welcomed us (whom we thought was the Maitre d' but we found out later he was the owner!) made us comfortable with his warmth and camaraderie. The starters (grilled prawns, fried calamari) were excellent and we were pleasantly surprised to get tiny shots of complimentary lemon sorbets to clean our palate after every course. The waiter was also very friendly and chatty and explained the various bull-fight trophys and photographs adorning the walls. Their staff was very accommodating and an off-the-menu request for a pasta for my daughter was readily prepared for her! We didn't have any space for deserts but were again plesantly surprised with complimentary sweets at the end!

The service was rushed and the food was overpriced for what it was (I guess you're paying for the name). What was the worst was we asked the waiter for recommendation between 2 different cuts of beef on the menu (I think it was a tenderloin versus a ribeye, both around 25 euros), he says oh I'll bring you something special and before we could ask anything else he was gone. The beef he brought us was this massive cut that was over-salted and overcooked and it was 65 euros. Which I think it's bad form for a restaurant to do.

St first glance the street that this place is located on seems a bit sidey so we had a bit of a debate on whether or not to go there, especially with a child. When we finally did decide to go in we had a great time. The restaurant is a bit snug as most of the eating places here, but since we went early we had no problems finding space for the baby stroller as well, though I expect it might be difficult if the place is a bit more crowded. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, our waiter Antonio gave us some excellent recommendations and was extremely attentive. We had the menu which was good value for money as we got 2 tapas, 1 side dish for 2 people and a stake main plate for two people, a house wine for two is also included but they let us change it for sangria.

After having eaten at the superb but very austere Sacha the night before the pureness of flavours and quality of the food were in sharp focus. We were amazed to find the same quality in a modern and hip cafe. We were served by Antonio and Ivan who were both superb. Antonio recommended several tapas which arrived beautifully presented in the glasses from which the Taberna takes its name (chata). The Patridge Pate, Tuna Tartare served on seaweed, super fresh guacamole, shrimp skewers and chargrilled octopus on a magnificent pimento infused mashed potato - AWESOME. But there was more to come - a super refreshing ""frozen Piña Colada"" for a quick and light dessert. The best jug of Tinto de Verano all for less than 20€ a head. When you go, be guided by Antonio or Ivan, as the menu changes according to what's fresh and what the wonderful chef is making on the day. But their suggestions were PERFECT and service flawless.

When we booked two months in advance there were only bar tables available.  The four of us shared the cheese croquettes, the duck terrine, the mackerel salad and the peas with beef tendon for starters. All were innovative and enjoyable but the peas were the best. Do not miss them.  For mains we had half portions of the chicken, skate, tuna tartare and the pork loin. All were delicious, although the skate was underwhelming. At the end we shared a crime brûlée and lemon pie.  Other reviewers noted a lack of English menus and some trouble communicating with staff. We found all staff members fluent in English and English menus were provided so it appears those issues have been remedied.

My best mate and I came in, wrestled a spot at the bar to order our first round of Gin cocktails and found a spot on the wall to lean against. The quality and size of the drinks were above my expectations (I'm a serious Gin drinker - Hendricks, Bombay and Tanqueray as the staple) and the selection of in-house distilled and infused styles were more than impressive.  Come the next Friday when our mate from London visited for the weekend we wanted to come back and share our new find. After some head scratching and detective work (saw the name of the restaurant across the road in my selfie from the Sunday) we re-found my new favourite bar. This time we widened the parameters and dabbled into some of the other liquors they distilled and I can freely confess their Rum's and Whiskey's are above par too and very drinkable. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a top shelf experience, ask the bar staff for their suggestions as I did and enjoyed the ones recommended. This one gets a 10/10 from me",2016-03-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396562-Reviews-or50-Macera_TallerBar-Madrid.html,UID_31686,0.005,0.866,0.128,0.9824,0.2173520923520923,0.3801948051948051,0.3591,1226,110,0.0897226753670473,0,26,False,39,0.12,0.12,0.36,0.04,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,226,146,4.424778761061947,0,0,bar randomli stumbl across sunday even pack look girl worth check favourit bar madrid probabl best visit month best mate came wrestl spot bar order first round gin cocktail found spot wall lean qualiti size drink expect seriou gin drinker hendrick bombay tanqueray stapl select hous distil infus style impress come next friday mate london visit weekend want come back share new find head scratch detect work saw name restaur across road selfi sunday found new favourit bar time widen paramet dabbl liquor distil freeli confess rum whiskey par drinkabl would recommend place anyon enjoy top shelf experi ask bar staff suggest enjoy one recommend one get,very good review,5

However, having recently chosen a restaurant in Montmartre based solely on reviews and being bitterly disappointed I was a little nervous. The previous restaurant, despite its good reviews, was almost empty. We arrived at this restaurant at 8pm and they were only just opening the doors so a bums on seats assessment seemed unfair. With some trepidation we stayed and we're we glad that we did. We ordered five tapas each and each one seemed better than the one before.

Nearby are other well-known and heavily booked restaurants, including some excellent seafood restaurants. But, this gem is worth the visit. The Sopa Castellana is an excellent typical delight, with just the right amount of garlic and soaking in bread, bacon and eggs.. The Rabo de Buey Estofado is perfectly simmered and as tender an ox-stew as you will ever find. The wine pairings were perfect. The creme caramel, mouth watering. There are two different menus. Ask for the one in Spanish. I think English menu is for the less adventurous. The Spanish menus are fixed price with a wide range of fish, foul, game and meats. Go early if you want a seat and don't have reservations. Better yet, secure reservations. Service is attentive and friendly.

We were so glad we went in. As you would, we took photo of pretty much each dishes. The owner saw that and offered to take us a photo as we were trying to do a selfie hehe. He speaks ljttle english but very welcoming, most of the guests came after us greeted warmly by him, and it appears to me that they were regulars. I recalled when we order our second round, as we wanted to order more, he actually stopped us and said that should be enough for the two of us. To me this is a small restaurant that cares about your dining experience and more importantly honesty!  In the end he offered us two spainsh wine (shot?) to finish up as we couldnt fit in any dessert. He said in his slightly broken english that you have to at least try the spainsh wine ( and he didnt charge us for it).

The ambience is very lively and old school. Many photos on the walls of famous and not so famous guests. Esteban is a wonderful host who makes everyone feel at home. The other staff follow his lead and make the evening a pleasure. They are able and willing to give advice and assistance about everything. The food has been terrific though this time, some things seemed not to be up to the normal standard. I do not know why. The salad seemed to have stayed a day longer in the kitchen than it should before being served. Still I enjoyed the meal very much. Esteban and the staff want to make sure you are happy and that everything is perfecto. It seems to have become much more popular among Americans though there are many Spanish people there as well.

Given the nice interior and smiley owner, one would expect the food is also good. WRONG!!! I ordered grilled sea bass. The piece of fish that came was a head cut with head bone included and not much actual fish meat. I asked to change that piece with proper middle cut fillet. They took the plate and about 15 minutes later returned exactly the same plate and same piece of fish with just bone and skin removed. After more conversation, they got it back. Another 15 minutes later the same plate was returned with half of a small fish on it. I pointed out that it is not a sea bass. They argue that it is, but got it back only to return exactly the same dish with fish turned skin up. After that I said forget it, don't bother, I don't want any fish anymore. At that point owner persuade me really hard to have their ""very best"" sole fish cooked. I gave up and agreed. The ""perfect sole"" came dry and oily, impossible to eat. This time I didn't complain just sat plate aside. However, the story was not over. This time guy with a good english came and asked what the problem. I explained everything from the beginning, and asked for a check. He insisted again they can cook fish for me, and I foolishly agreed another time. That was a mistake! Another 20 minutes, and piece of fish came on SAME plate (with same piece of already cold potato) overcooked on one side and completely raw on another. When I pointed out that fish is raw, the owner said they can cook that piece more... That was it, I insisted on having a check, and another blow - they included the charge for grilled sea bass in a bill !!! So, we have to ask to get it off the bill. And they seem to believe they are doing us a favor by removing it. Overall, they never assume any responsibility, nor apologize for ruining our dinner.",2017-11-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1496002-Reviews-or140-El_Rincon_de_Esteban-Madrid.html,UID_31767,0.068,0.836,0.096,0.9456,0.0104210639462163,0.3814165103189493,0.2936346153846154,1878,165,0.0878594249201278,7,59,False,74,0.1044776119402985,0.0597014925373134,0.2835820895522388,0.044776119402985,0.1492537313432835,0.044776119402985,0.0298507462686567,0.044776119402985,0.1492537313432835,0.0895522388059701,355,198,4.292957746478873,0,0,last day madrid realli terribl experi restaur given nice interior smiley owner one would expect food also good wrong order grill sea bass piec fish came head cut head bone includ much actual fish meat ask chang piec proper middl cut fillet took plate minut later return exactli plate piec fish bone skin remov convers got back anoth minut later plate return half small fish point sea bass argu got back return exactli dish fish turn skin said forget bother want fish anymor point owner persuad realli hard best sole fish cook gave agre perfect sole came dri oili imposs eat time complain sat plate asid howev stori time guy good english came ask problem explain everyth begin ask check insist cook fish foolishli agre anoth time mistak anoth minut piec fish came plate piec alreadi cold potato overcook one side complet raw anoth point fish raw owner said cook piec insist check anoth blow includ charg grill sea bass bill ask get bill seem believ us favor remov overal never assum respons apolog ruin dinner,bad review,2

Having booked a table (about an hour prior to arriving), we went off to the place. When we arrived, it seemed that they did not quite have their bookings in order, as we weren't in the book. We did manage to get a table anyway, and got seated. We were presented with some olives and a lovely little muscle starter, while looking at the menu. We went with one of the two available menus, which included a starter, a main, a dessert, wine, coffee and a chupito. The food was very nice - everything cooked to perfection, although the fish main could have used some sauce or the similar on the side to add some flavor. The wine was very nice, and although we did not get quite as much as was stated on the menu (1/2 bottle per menu, we only got a bottle to share amongst the three of us), we did get a glass of Cava with the dessert in stead. The dessert was excellent too. We never did receive the chupito that was mentioned. The only negative thing to add for this place is, that the service seemed very rushed. We had barely taken the last bite of the starter, before the plate was taken away. We were brought a small lemon sorbet to cleanse the pallet (as we were having dishes with fish), which two of us didn't even get to start before the main dish came to the table. When pouring it seemed that the waiter did not want to spend more time than absolutely necessary at the table, which made us feel like they just wanted us out as fast as possible.

At every other restaurant in the world I have eaten at they don't charge for the bread and butter on the table, but here there was a $6 charge on the bill for ""pan, mantequilla y aperit"" which translates as ""bread, butter, and snacks and drinks."" Although a review on this site had alerted me to avoid certain items even though they were on the table since they were not complimentary, I still was not able to avoid the charge for the bread, butter and small after dinner drink they served which was not ordered. It would be a better dining experience if not having to be on guard watching for the restaurant slipping in extra charges for items not ordered but served, or already on the table until explicitly refused and removed. I should have said something to the waiter at the end when getting the bill but it would be a smoother experience if not having to be so vigilant. The restaurant is smaller and older. The type of place where the owner may give a woman a kiss on the hand. They have a book in which they seem to record which hotel referred each dining guest. On a different note, regarding breakfast, in the same area, perhaps a couple blocks away, VIPS has a very good breakfast at a very reasonable price. Served quickly, good food, good price. Not the same type of dining as El Rincon de Esteban but worth noting if staying in that area.",2013-11-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1496002-Reviews-or430-El_Rincon_de_Esteban-Madrid.html,UID_31776,0.041,0.837,0.122,0.9789,0.2209523809523809,0.4531709956709955,0.46973,1586,162,0.1021437578814628,0,33,False,61,0.1186440677966101,0.135593220338983,0.3050847457627119,0.1016949152542373,0.1694915254237288,0.0,0.0,0.0677966101694915,0.0677966101694915,0.0338983050847457,295,167,4.379661016949153,0,0,food good servic also good one practic detract top notch experi note review also charg item order everi restaur world eaten charg bread butter tabl charg bill pan mantequilla aperit translat bread butter snack drink although review site alert avoid certain item even though tabl sinc complimentari still abl avoid charg bread butter small dinner drink serv order would better dine experi guard watch restaur slip extra charg item order serv alreadi tabl explicitli refus remov said someth waiter end get bill would smoother experi vigil restaur smaller older type place owner may give woman kiss hand book seem record hotel refer dine guest differ note regard breakfast area perhap coupl block away vip good breakfast reason price serv quickli good food good price type dine el rincon de esteban worth note stay area,good review,4

Nothing was too much trouble.  Between course sorbet, was a nice touch.  The anchovy dish as a starter set the standard for the rest of the courses.  The oxtail was in a rich sauce with homemade chips. The salmon and hake dish was delicate and tasty. Both were excellent.  Dessert was homemade and heavenly.  Excellent coffee with complimentary biscuits and chocolate.  Then the owner brought us complimentary liquers, (which he topped up frequently). A perfect evening.  If you only eat out once in Madrid make this place your choice.

However, the Westin had 30% discount and we wanted to take a walk in the park nearby. The food was decent. Nothing to write home about. What managed to upset me was a small beer for 11 Euros.

I ordered the fried shrimp rolls with avocado and I couldn't get enough! They were delicious, I can't wait to explore more sushi. The restaurant however was way too pretentious for me. Upon entering the completely empty restaurant the host asked us if we had a reservation to which we replied ""no"" and then she fussed around on her ipad for a few minutes and kept saying there was nothing available. Eventually another waiter came out and they told us we could sit and eat at the bar but as soon as we sat down they told us we could have a table-We got a table I'm not complaining-Our waiter though seemed almost annoyed that he had to help us. My friends are no strangers to sushi but having never tried it I was asking them and the waiter questions about the menu and he basically rolled his eyes and answered me in a very mono-tone voice. He never came back to the table to check on us and never spoke a word when giving us our check and cashing us out. When we left about an hour later the restaurant wasn't even half full so all that stuff about not having any space available was strange in hindsight. The food was great though!

Kabuki Wellington is probably the best place for sushi in Madrid, it has to do with a mix of ambiance, food, service & location. This makes it in my opinion the best place in Madrid for sushi and related items. Only 1 dish did not have my liking, which was sashimi made out of sole (linguado).

We had a wonderful meal and were looked after very well by the charming hostess. The restaurant was starting to get busier when we were leaving about 9:30.

The menu is not extensive, but what it lacks in choice is very much made up for in great quality food, well chosen choices to offer, and a lovely ambience. The young owner, Maria Brufau was our host, and I understand her husband is the Chef, who incidentally, is also a magician with food. What makes it even more attractive is that their Starters can be served in half portions or as Main Courses. I had Prawn Risotto to start and it was magnificent. This was followed by one of the most succulent steaks I've had for some time. So good, just add pepper - no sauces needed! And a fabulous dessert to close.

We couldn't have made a better choice. Overall we ate six different dishes sharing them to sample the menu better and it was an excellent idea. It was probably a bit too much for one evening, but we couldn't stop - everything was tasty - and interesting, as we learned something new with every new dish that landed on our table. I especially recommend ""croquetas de jamón"" and ""Pimientos de Piquillo rellenos de Rabo de Toro gratinado"" (which is a dish made of meat from a bull's tail) as well as ""Salmorejo de Almendras y Chipotle"". Even our 5 yr old found something that she liked - a hamburger made without spices especially for her. We ended up with home made tarts (the toffee-caramel tart is heavenly!), coffee and a glass of pacharan, a special digestive liqueur brought by our wonderful host. Then we had to take our overfilled bodies back to the hotel freeing the table for others already waiting for a place. As I write this three days later I can also tell that everything was fresh and of good quality as we didn't have any bad side effects of our overindulgence.  Apart from great food we did get excellent service - Jose Miguel, who I think is the owner, assisted us from the start speaking both Spanish and English - he really knows what he serves, he is able to explain all the dishes, how they are made and advise what to take.

It was fully booked but they squeezed us in and we were so glad they did. This is rated as one of the best restaurants in Madrid, and I can now see why.

We booked it purely by accident due to its good reviews on El Tenedor without regard to its non-central location. What good luck! It was by far one of the best meals I've had in Spain, and certainly the best of our most recent trip to Madrid. My sister and I were mostly bowled over by the excellent and personal service. One waitress was on duty (it is a small place) and though we didn't get her name, her attentiveness and her enthusiastic recommendations truly made our night. The white wine she recommended (an Albariño by Bicos) was amazing (and ridiculous value at €2.30 a glass). She was super friendly and made great effort to communicate with us in her basic English and our broken Spanish. She seemed knowledgeable and passionate about the dishes and the wines. I'm not exaggerating when I say her service truly made our night. A huge departure from the surly/cold manner of some restaurant staff we'd encountered elsewhere! The food was excellent - in particular the Iberico pork cheek main. I was nervous about trying the waitress' recommendation for dessert - rice pudding with cinnamon ice cream - but it was really special. Highly recommended if you are shopping at El Corté Ingles. Even if not, it is well worth travelling to since it is only a few metro stops from the centre of Madrid. Our bill came to around €40 for 2 courses for 2 people including a glass of wine each. Absolutely fantastic value.",2015-06-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7933973-Reviews-or10-La_MaMa_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_31870,0.037,0.767,0.196,0.9918,0.2803696741854636,0.5359523809523811,0.276725,1548,119,0.0768733850129198,2,38,False,67,0.1333333333333333,0.16,0.24,0.0933333333333333,0.16,0.0266666666666666,0.0133333333333333,0.04,0.0933333333333333,0.04,273,183,4.673992673992674,0,0,le mam small neighbourhood restaur tourist track though nearbi huge el cort ingl nuevo ministero book pure accid due good review el tenedor without regard non central locat good luck far one best meal spain certainli best recent trip madrid sister mostli bowl excel person servic one waitress duti small place though get name attent enthusiast recommend truli made night white wine recommend albari bico amaz ridicul valu glass super friendli made great effort commun us basic english broken spanish seem knowledg passion dish wine exagger say servic truli made night huge departur surli cold manner restaur staff encount elsewher food excel particular iberico pork cheek main nervou tri waitress recommend dessert rice pud cinnamon ice cream realli special highli recommend shop el cort ingl even well worth travel sinc metro stop centr madrid bill came around cours peopl includ glass wine absolut fantast valu,good review,4

Sunday brunch was phenomenal. The quality and presentation of tapas alone in the Rotonda's buffets puts many specialist tapas bars to shame. The Rotonda's waiters are consummate professionals who with genial courtesy maintain the highest standard of service - materialising fresh cutlery, refilling coffee, or other services as necessary, quickly and unobtrusively. We like the Rotonda so much that on our return to Madrid, when we chose to stay in an apartment, we walked back there every morning for breakfast. We looked at the buffet in the Ritz across the Paseo del Prado from the Westin Palace as a breakfast option - and immediately went back to the Westin's Rotonda.

In addition to more ""traditional"" items the menu has California rolls, Syrian salad, Humus, tempura dishes... Japanese dumplings...  I tried the Empanadillas Japonesas (roasted Japanese dumplings), Quesadilla con Huitlacoche, Hamburguesa 4x4 (4 small hamburgers, two different sauces - my favorite was the wassabi sauce). All really good and tasty. We chose the house Rioja wine - and it was very good. The atmosphere is very comfortable, laid-back and at the same time hip. The walls have fun frames with ""modern-art""-like pieces in them. It felt very comfy for lunch, and looks like a very cozy for dinner or drinks. The decor on the way to the restrooms, and the restrooms themselves are very funky as well :) While they didn't really speak English, the people working there were helpful and we communicated just fine :)  Music was playing all the time, not too loudly, so overall it was just fine.

The Rotonda, with its spectacular stained glass dome, is an island of peace and beauty right in the artistic heart of Madrid. Its own contribution to the arts scene is the weekly Opera Brunch on Sundays. It starts at 13.30 and consists of an hour and a quarter of opera, combined with delicious food and drink. Each month the musical theme changes: July is French romantic opera with soprano and tenor, and August features opera set in Spain.... From the buffet you can create your own 6-7 course gourmet meal with small (or large!) portions of interesting creative food: stuffed artichokes, ‘bombon de foie’, bresaola with goat’s cheese, cheese with pine nuts.....everything is tempting and the only limit is the size of your stomach! My wife was particularly impressed by the desserts and the chocolate fountain. The service is natural (as in not '5 star condescending’), friendly and efficient. The all-inclusive price of 77 euro per person covers everything: setting, opera, food, cava, wine, coffee, VAT..... and is good value for what you get, and I’m someone who equally writes about 9.50 euro set lunches.",2013-07-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1966480-Reviews-or200-La_Rotonda-Madrid.html,UID_2508,0.0,0.791,0.209,0.9944,0.3291383219954648,0.6268707482993198,0.28725,1299,90,0.069284064665127,2,50,False,30,0.1372549019607843,0.1764705882352941,0.2352941176470588,0.0784313725490196,0.1568627450980392,0.0588235294117647,0.0098039215686274,0.0392156862745098,0.0392156862745098,0.0686274509803921,219,158,4.936073059360731,0,0,came palac opera brunch celebr round wed anniversari love rest meal three hour feet dal exhibit reina sofia rotonda spectacular stain glass dome island peac beauti right artist heart madrid contribut art scene weekli opera brunch sunday start consist hour quarter opera combin delici food drink month music theme chang juli french romant opera soprano tenor august featur opera set spain buffet creat cours gourmet meal small larg portion interest creativ food stuf artichok bombon de foie bresaola goat chees chees pine nut everyth tempt limit size stomach wife particularli impress dessert chocol fountain servic natur star condescend friendli effici inclus price euro per person cover everyth set opera food cava wine coffe vat good valu get someon equal write euro set lunch,good review,4

Our servers were impeccable and tended to all of our needs - clearing plates, topping off wine/water, offering an assortment of breads, etc. We were given a mussel in cream sauce amuse bouche to start, compliments of the hotel, which was delicious. We then both ordered a soup - I had the broccoli soup, which was good but needed a bit more salt for my taste. My bf had the potato soup which was served from a large bowl that had enough servings for two. He said it was delicious but very filling. I had the lamb with mushrooms and it was so good. The lamb was tender and perfectly cooked and the mushrooms in this creamy sauce added such a great balance. My bf had the grilled octopus (which I should say comes as one big tentacle and not small pieces) and a salad. To top it off, I had the hazelnut tiramsu and my bf had the creme brulee, both of which were great. (I should also say I've had the raspberry sherbet and it is OUTSTANDING.) We also ate here for breakfast - once a la cart and once for the buffet. I would not recommend a la cart in the morning because the chefs were so busy making food for the buffet that our order did not come for over half an hour. Our waiter was great though, very apologetic and he went in and had them make our order right away. The buffet offers a really great assortment of not only a Western breakfast, but offers traditional breakfasts for other cultures which I thought was fantastic.

It's in a nice square (with 3 or 4 other restaurants) a little off the beaten track but, in reality, only 5 minutes from the Plaza Mayor. The food is excellent and a bit more varied than a lot of the other restaurants. They do something they refer to as a 'Wok' which is essentially a stir fry served with either noodles or rice and with a choice of sauces (spicy, oyster or something else). All of the different tapas we tried were excellent, even the deconstructed margarita pizza!  And they do great puddings! Try the 'Lemon Pie' - a version of lemon meringue pie! Beware though, the portions of desserts can be quite large so think about sharing if you're already quite full. At lunchtime they do an incredibly good value set lunch but the food is reasonably priced in the evening too.  The staff are generally very friendly but it does get quite busy so you need to adopt a bit of a Spanish mentality and chill! To accommodate foreigners who don't want to eat too late in the evening, they serve 'merienda' from 5.30pm till 8pm. This is a sort of enhanced range of tapas - and perfectly adequate as a meal.  We'd definitely come back if we were in Madrid again.",2012-10-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1089337-Reviews-or280-La_Musa-Madrid.html,UID_31962,0.011,0.81,0.179,0.994,0.2612554112554112,0.5437229437229437,0.3987916666666666,1256,113,0.089968152866242,4,37,False,59,0.0967741935483871,0.1935483870967742,0.2903225806451613,0.032258064516129,0.2258064516129032,0.0,0.032258064516129,0.0,0.0967741935483871,0.032258064516129,233,162,4.381974248927039,0,0,ate coupl time madrid lunchtim even nice squar restaur littl beaten track realiti minut plaza mayor food excel bit vari lot restaur someth refer wok essenti stir fri serv either noodl rice choic sauc spici oyster someth els differ tapa tri excel even deconstruct margarita pizza great pud tri lemon pie version lemon meringu pie bewar though portion dessert quit larg think share alreadi quit full lunchtim incred good valu set lunch food reason price even staff gener friendli get quit busi need adopt bit spanish mental chill accommod foreign want eat late even serv merienda pm till pm sort enhanc rang tapa perfectli adequ meal definit come back madrid,good review,4

A very generous gesture from their part. This time it was more the kind of experience I had always had at La Musa: friendly service and absolutley stunning food. Even bearing in mind that the staff were obviously going out of their way to make sure everything was perfect on this occasion - which it was. If you have read through the rest of reviews you will have seen many enthusiastic comments. Believe the hype. I have not found a better place in this area of Madrid. Just be mindful of busy times, like Friday/Saturday night, when it's likely to be packed and you may have to wait some time for a table and then be served by a somewhat frazzled waiter. The food alone will be worth waiting (not too long though!) - try the 'tomates verdes fritos' and the 'jabalí con ali-oli de miel y sobrasada' (the star of the menu), and practically everything from the 'Tapas BBQ' section. Just writing about it is mouth watering. There is really not much I can add without repeating what others have already said here. If you find yourself in Madrid and fancy trying some of the best tapas in town in one of its trendies spots, pop in La Musa. *my original review: http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1089337-r121363876-La_Musa-Madrid.html#REVIEWS",2012-07-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1089337-Reviews-or280-La_Musa-Madrid.html,UID_31966,0.036,0.853,0.111,0.9693,0.2554999999999999,0.5615555555555556,0.3442538461538461,1541,131,0.0850097339390006,1,57,True,57,0.180327868852459,0.180327868852459,0.2786885245901639,0.0491803278688524,0.1475409836065573,0.0327868852459016,0.0163934426229508,0.0163934426229508,0.081967213114754,0.0163934426229508,266,183,4.796992481203008,1,0,mainli follow review wrote month ago disastr previou visit link glad say final conctact la musa manag discuss complaint invit come dinner next visit madrid gener gestur part time kind experi alway la musa friendli servic absolutley stun food even bear mind staff obvious go way make sure everyth perfect occas read rest review seen mani enthusiast comment believ hype found better place area madrid mind busi time like friday saturday night like pack may wait time tabl serv somewhat frazzl waiter food alon worth wait long though tri tomat verd frito jabal con ali oli de miel sobrasada star menu practic everyth tapa bbq section write mouth water realli much add without repeat other alreadi said find madrid fanci tri best tapa town one trendi spot pop la musa origin review http www tripadvisor co uk showuserreview g r la musa madrid html review,good review,4

We had dinner here on Easter Sunday, figuring that most places would be closed that evening. Then, a few days later, we had breakfast at their buffet.

Got there at 8.30pm I think, Said would be a half hour wait, that wasn't a problem for us. We had a drink at the bar and then seated when ready. We went with the tasting menu as recommended by other reviewers. It didn't disappoint.

The other main was a stuffed partridge which was dry and inedible with an over-reduced sweet/salty sauce.  The front of house staff were ok, but the chef came into the restaurant on a number of occasions; smelling strongly of cigarettes and raising his voice to the staff, so that the atmosphere was quite unpleasant.

In particular the Chef was rude and a male-chauvinist, paying attention only to the men in the table. He also tricked us a couple of times with the order: he tried to include one Starter too many, then included a full portion instead of the half we had ordered, and particularly irritating, he included the much more expensive version of one dish (with white truffle) without clarifying there were two versions - even when we had pointed to the cheaper one. I AM NOT GOING BACK.

We began with cocktails and were treated to wonderful salmon with lemon and assorted fresh baked breads. We then did a custom combination platter of Special de Claire and Napoleon oysters that really impressed. These were simply prepared, fresh and delicious. We then opted for the Evaristo sole for two as our entree, with a lightly dressed green salad and onions for a perfect side dish. The sole was perfectly prepared and simply splendid. Our meal was paired with a dry and crisp Verdejo that  was a delightful accompaniment. For a sweet ending, we shared a silky flan and individual presses of chamomile tea; a perfect ending to a divine dining experience.
