Staff were attentive and very friendly, menus are offered in either Spanish or English. I ordered a glass of house white, beautiful. Bread and chorizo and cheese was brought to the table once we had ordered. We shared potatas bravas for starters - one of the best if not THE best we’ve ever had! The sauce they put on top with the tomato sauce was amazing, still no idea what it was but gorgeous! Partner had the prawn risotto for main, so buttery and tasty and good size, struggled to finish it. I ordered the tuna on pickles with potatoes, tuna was rare and seared on the outside but fell apart, one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Place filled up fast and can see why you need to book.

Overall the food was good but not great. My favourite dish is the pressed duck. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. However the service desperately needs improvement. Some of the waiters were very inexperienced. One of them tried to slice the duck in front us but almost dropped the duck on the floor! A senior waiter had to take over and asked the young guy to press the bones. But again the poor guy spilled the juice!  My parents didn't feel like drinking so I ordered totally 4 glasses of different wine. The amount the waiters poured in each glass was so little that I thought it was just for tasting. I think generally they didn't pour more than 80cc per glass. I'm sure they can easily pour more than 10 glasses from each bottle.

I should say that the menu (not tasting menu) hasn’t many dishes but I consider they are enough.

Attentive service but a little bit disordered, posh atmosphere (maybe for the neighbourhood where the restaurant is).

My thoughts on the food: Bloody mary and anchovy - Hit. Nice refreshing cocktail and very fresh anchovy. Shrimp fritters - Miss. This is a very easy street snack that’s available in so many Asian countries which requires practically zero effort.  Ham, eggs, potato - Hit. Nice but effortless Shaomai - This was a major turn off. Tastes nth like shaomai, it’s like a tomato broth thing and chickpeas is nothing to do with Asian food so I can’t relate this to shaomai Peppers - Miss. Nothing special honestly, night as well have a plate of padron peppers Rooster wattle - Requested to change and I don’t want to eat weird stuff. Got a fried cod which was a hit - it tastes good, sweet n sourish. Brioche stuffed with tail curry and green shiso - Miss. It’s like a mixture of Indian, trying to add Japanese. Too confusing  Mushroom ramen - Miss. I don’t know what is this dish trying to achieve, it’s neither asian nor western. It’s very very poorly done and bland. Red Prawns - Hit. One of the best dish by far, but it’s just effortless grilled prawns Wild turbot - Miss. Mine was undercooked and my partner one looks burnt Pork - Miss. Covered by unappetising black stuff and the pork is just bland. Like the piece of pork I throw into the Asiansoup for flavouring. It’s really horrible Desserts - Hit. Thank goodness for yummy desserts to makeup for a terrible meal. More misses than hits. However, I have to admit that the bar concept idea is amazing where everyone eats the same time so it’s consistent. Staffs are definitely 5 stars and they go out of the way to make you feel so comfortable dining here. The wine pairing is also amazing despite lousy food.  The team is really amazing but the food really needs to change - it can’t be Asian influences as none of it would pass any Asian tongue. I’m okay as i’m very adventurous but not towards half-half kind of food which is neither here nor there, and most importantly if it does not taste good.  It’s funny to observe the people opposite us who stuffed themselves with bread and gave funny faces. Couple on the left kept complaining. Couple on the right was annoyed too and kept asking us how was the food. Clearly most people in the room did not enjoy their food (the way they complained and their body language too).  Nevertheless, the team should receive a compliment for being amazing people.

On service ---The team tried hard to please and be attentive.  On food-- we ordered the tasting menu. They asked if we were allergic to any food or anything we did not eat and would adjust the menu accordingly. The cold shrimp soup was extremely salty and to a point where it was bitter. We brought this to the staff's attention, and they replaced it with a cold tomato soup. It was still a bit on the salty side, but better than the cold shrimp soup.  The tuna was not special. For a fine dining restaurant, the dish was not that spectacular. It felt like someone seared a tuna steak. And the presentation of the dish was very simple. Then came the pork.

A sherry bar on the left as you come in, the bar restaurant on the right and the restaurant at the back. The bar restaurant serves a 7 course lunch only, the centre of the bar being the 'kitchen'. Extremely friendly cooking staff. A most unhelpful sommelier. What can I say about the food? A great deal of Tupperware is involved in the assembly of dishes. The food is earthy but bland. The dessert was pleasant. Coffee awful. To book online for the bar restaurant, there is a 50 Euro charge per person. In our case, this was not subtracted from the bill. Maybe the restaurant excited the Michelin inspectors. Avoid. For a wonderful imaginative meal, head for La Cabra.

Just look for the big sign by the road with the restaurant name. From the outside the restaurant looks like a normal house.  Inside there is an amazing restaurant. We visited for lunch. Next time we come for a dinner.  Sitting at the bar around the kitchen watching the chefs working was fantastic.  All our 8 courses at lunch was fantastic. Delicious and very tasty.  Go also for the wine tasting menu.  The food is served and explained by the chefs. And you can have a dialog with the chefs. We loved it.  If I could give 6 stars I would.

Each dinner was exceptional in its own way, elegant, beautifully presented and delicious, creative food. Each small bite or dish was exquisite, each meal was substantial and I loved the creativity of each of these chefs. The service at each location was superb, the staff were extremely educated on the dishes and eager to share their knowledge, and extremely attentive to your needs and desires. You left each location feeling pampered. Each location was a special, elegant restaurant where you did not feel out of place in jeans and a nice shirt. Each was artfully decorated, and beautiful in its own right. Note: These dinners allow the chefs to be creative in their art, this is not the place you come to for standard fare. Enjoying this meal includes opening you mind and palate to the possibilities and creativity of each of these artists.  Dinner at each of these restaurants is a decadent treat and I was privileged to be able to do three of these on consecutive nights. Specific to A'barra. Food: The food was excellent. It was on the modern side, but I loved the flashbacks to traditional flavors. The meal was hearty and on the richer side. I loved the variety of flavors and the presentation was beautiful.  This is not a restaurant fir vegetarians. My wife was disappointed with her dinner and expected more from a chef of this caliber.  Ambiance: This was the most elaborately decorated of the three restaurants. It had a more formal atmosphere and feel to the restaurant. The tables, chairs and fixtures were exquisite. The atmosphere ensured that you were going to be spoilt. Service: Once again fabulous service, attentive and caring.  We loved dinner here, except for my wife, and would recommend this restaurant.

The first you notice coming in is that there was a very strong effort in preserving the original traditional look but adding very cool ""twists"" to it. The same applies to the food and that's one of the reasons why this place is my favourite restaurant in Madrid. My favourite dishes are the ""croquetas de jamón"" - absolutely delicious (and I've tried my share of them in other places), the seafood fake risotto, the octopus (pulpo), the stuffed squids (chipirones), the pork sirloin (secreto de cerdo), and last but not least the wonderful ""milhojas"", a mille-feuille - a dessert made with stacked layers of puff pastry filled with dulce de leche: a creamy mix of condensed milk, sugar, and vanilla.

We thought we would look out his other bar/restaurant. Like he had said, this is more Spanish and definitely one for the locals but one that us tourist folk will love.

Perfect time for tapas and a refreshment ;) Again the staff here are great, explained all the tapas options while we ordered drinks and there choices did not disappoint. Unfortunately I cannot remember the ages but the pics show how good it was. Like the restaurant from previous nights. The flavours where fab, all so fresh and a perfect size, enough to keep you satisfied without spooling appetite for that nights meal. A chef came out to chat and checked all was okay and told us a bit about the bar and that nights menu.  It's a place to stop for an espresso, a beer or a full sit down food adventure.

Amazing wine list, great sommelier. The strange thing about this place is that while it tries to portray a progressive, modern, relaxed decor, the service is very old-school formal, bordering on stuffy. The uniforms, for example, look like something out of a Nantucket beach resort, khakis, sperry top siders, bow ties, but they move and act as if wearing tails. Oddly, our waiter's pants had two holes on his behind apparently caused by the wallet. This alone makes it bizarre. Very high end, all attention to details, but they don't give the waiter a new pair of pants so he parades around with holes on his rear end. Now the food. After all, while decor goes a long way, what good is it without great food. I had the vegetable appetizer, it was bland and way overcooked, honestly tasted like it came from the frozen section of the supermarket. The seabass, bland, very bland, and while it was a generous portion, the center was so undercooked it was spongy and chewy, therefore unedible. The chef can't figure out how to cook seabass? My friend ordered the beef and that was way better, I should have followed suit. Bottom line? I will not return. Shame, for the space is truly beautiful and the service just needs a new pair of pants, but the food is disappointing.",2017-03-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10296026-Reviews-or40-A_Barra-Madrid.html,UID_29162,0.054,0.748,0.198,0.9903,0.2633567937438905,0.585841642228739,0.3611066666666666,1388,113,0.0814121037463977,0,50,False,39,0.0925925925925925,0.2037037037037037,0.2777777777777778,0.074074074074074,0.2037037037037037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296296296296296,0.0185185185185185,246,165,4.646341463414634,0,0,first good space truli beauti servic wonder well orchestr bit top amaz wine list great sommeli strang thing place tri portray progress modern relax decor servic old school formal border stuffi uniform exampl look like someth nantucket beach resort khaki sperri top sider bow tie move act wear tail oddli waiter pant two hole behind appar caus wallet alon make bizarr high end attent detail give waiter new pair pant parad around hole rear end food decor goe long way good without great food veget appet bland way overcook honestli tast like came frozen section supermarket seabass bland bland gener portion center undercook spongi chewi therefor uned chef figur cook seabass friend order beef way better follow suit bottom line return shame space truli beauti servic need new pair pant food disappoint,bad review,2

This is a one-star Michelin restaurant and definitely deserves the star, food-wise, service-wise, and price-wise.

Among the nine of us, we shared many small plates of outstandingly presented and delicious food--very high-end imaginative dishes and excellent service. The folks who work there are true professionals. What was really cool was that each time a new plate was presented (each person had a portion placed at his seating), all of the plates were covered with a dome, and each person had a server, and they all lifted the domes at one time--extraordinary!  After we dined, we were given a tour of the restaurant, which was very impressive.

I booked a table a week in advance (phone only in Spanish) for 15:30 but have your hotel do it for you if you don't speak Castellano. (Weekdays best to do it at least 48hrs before) My wife had grilled ""pulpo"" (octopus) while I had their award-winning ""cachopo"" (thin cut sirloin steak with sliced jamón serrano and cheese in a delicate batter, deep fried. Typical regional dish from the northern province of Asturias. Wonderful. Not the dish for a diet, nor for one person. Two could easily have this as a main course and at only 17 euros a true bargain. Last year El Cogollo won first prize for the best ""cachopo"" in Madrid. I had two bottles of Asturian cider, my wife two or three glasses of a decent Albariño white wine from Galicia. Four coffees, one dessert. I think we paid 52 euros. Miguel, the owner who is from Asturias but has lived in Madrid for over thirty years gave me a couple of free ""chupitos"" of ""orujo con miel"" (Asturian Marc/brandy with honey). I have been drinking this for years. It is delicious and hard to find outside of Asturias. This place is always full of ""madrileños (Madrid natives) so please book a table if you don't want to be turned away. For price/quality you will be hard pressed to find a more authentic local restaurant in the centre of Madrid. Don't worry if you don't speak Spanish.

There were no tables outside, it looked isolated from the rest.  When we entered, we noticed everything was full and the server asked us if we wanted to wait. We decided to do so.

First, the location is near the Plaza Mayor, but is tucked out of the way. The restaurant is small, about 8 tables. Dinner begins at 8:30 and if you are timely, seating should be ok. By 9:30, it is full. The food is terrific and plentiful. It is Comida Asturiana fare from northern Spain. My wife and I shared a very tasty salad of lettuce, tuna and tomato sauce. I assure you, the dish tasted way better than I am making it sound. I wish we could find something like this in the U.S. Then we had Cachopo, a dish of veal fillets stuffed with ham and cheese. Again, this description does not do the dish justice. We had been advised in our recommendation that we should share the dish and our waitress affirmed that. A total understatement. My wife and I shared half of the portion presented and we took the other half home for tomorrow. And it was terrific. While fairly full, we simply had to try and share a dessert. We ordered a torte de Lupe. OMG!! Awesome. And fairly light. Finally, the house wines were very good, and so was the bread. The atmosphere was really nice, dark blue table cloths with a white top cloth, if that helps set the scene. Service was perfect and friendly. This all earns El Cogollo the 5 stars. But know that the ""cuenta"" came to 42 Euros, before tip. Incredible. We have been in Spain now 28 days. We have eaten at different restaurants for all but 3 days.

When we decided to visit Madrid, I started looking for places where Cachopo was offered in the menu. There are at least 4 places, but this one seems to be the best from a quality-price point of view.

The perfect combination of almost crisp exterior, and the tender flesh (reminded me of lobster texture) and garlic oil was delicious. I'm still thinking about it a day later and hoping for the next day to return and eat this again. We also had the cachopo, which is thin/flattened steak stuffed with ham and cheese, breaded and fried - a bit like a cross between a chicken cordon bleu and an American chicken-fried steak. This was also good, and the portion was huge, but to me it wasn't as special as the octopus. If you had to choose between the two, I'd definitely recommend the octopus. Value was great - €18 for the pulpo and €16 for the cachopo, considering the portion size. Ambience was decent, as a local restaurant, and round the corner from the Mercado de San Miguel and near Plaza Mayor. Wait staff I think don't speak much English, but they are friendly enough.

We got the standard Margherita pizza with fresh tomatoes and basil, but it was the homemade dough and the oregano infused sauce that really made it great.

On our arrival at just after 9pm, much to our surprise, the restaurant was literally empty and the waiter seemed surprised to see us or anyone for that matter. He said they had no reservations on the system. After some back and forth in broken Spanish (no one spoke English there but we and they were patient in our exchange). They found the reservation and we were seated. After this unsettling start, I can say that we were treated warmly and had a lovely meal feeling moe comfortable though a bit lonely :-). They have a menu of the day that is very affordable and with a nice selection of appetizers and main dishes as well as ala carte with all the items leaning on classic Spanish dishes which was a major reason we chose this spot. Our meals were quite good. Wine selection was also very good. We learned that the restaurant is usually packed for lunch and often very quiet for dinner. Only 3 other couples were dining on our departure at 11 and enjoying the food as well.

We ended up spending about 20 euro and left so full, drunk and happy! Going back to Madrid this will be our very first stop!

You could easily walk by and miss it - but don't! It is worth the experience. We arrived on the early side for Spain (about 8:00 p.m.) and enjoyed a delicious appetizer of fresh, thinly sliced jamon iberico (right off the leg - a technique that is interesting to watch). My husband and I enjoyed two exquisite meals. The fish was simply prepared and served with a choice of sauces - I chose a tomato, and my husband chose something more like a lemon butter. Both were delicious as was the dessert. This is a small, cozy restaurant - good for a romantic evening. A worthwhile treat!

Im just a regular joe, not a snooty food connoisseur, so take what I say with a grain of salt, I guess. We found this place, kinda by accident. We were vacationing here from the states, on our way to the ATM to get some euros and passed by this place, which looked cool but a little intimidating. It was a packed bar area with what seemed like a lot of locals, and we dont really (not really at all) speak spanish so we were a bit weary. But, as soon as you walk in, the guys at the bar are shouting asking you what you want to drink, even though we are 2-3 people back from the bar, just inside the door. Hmmm, not sure but let’s go with some beer. They pour it right up and we pick it up at the bar. So far so good. Then they send out a tapa. Um, we didnt order this but they insisted that it was for us. Ok, sure. Some sort of fried eggplant. Im not an eggplant person, but it was good. Then they bring us a menu, in spanish, until they realize we dont speak spanish, so they bring us an English menu, very nice service. Prices seem super reasonable, 2.50 euro beer, 2 euro red wine, assorted tapas from like 2-12 euros. We are not really sure what to get food wise, so we order 2 red wines. Taste fine, but another tapa comes out. Again, excuse, we didnt order, still for us. Ok, thanks.  That was pretty much how the night went. We would order drinks, they would send out tapas. We would order more drinks, they would bring out more tapas. Cant remember all the tapas we had but the fried calamari was unreal, like melt in your mouth. The knives clams were good. Everything was really tasty. The guys next to us got this steak, looked delicious.  So, end of the night, we ask for the bill and we are alittle worried since we werent really specifying which wine or beer when we ordered, and we had gotten a bunch of tapas that we had not ordered. BUT, when we got the bill, we had to do a few double takes. There were just some charges for some beers and wines (2.5 euros for beer, 2 euros for wine) and no charges for food. Had to confirm with the servers and they said everything was right.  So it was such a great night, with great drinks, great food, great service and great atmosphere, we had to go back the next night. We ordered more items off the menu (had to try the steak!) and it was amazing again! Only problem is we had to leave the next day for Cordoba and Seville!

The menu offers different typically Italian dishes, where pasta is the main product. It also has a selection of fine Italian wines. Lovely decoration and tones are neutral but intimate. Dishes on the menu: I liked the salad with bogavante/lobster (although a small portion) was very good. The Vitello tonné was excellent but my spinach and ricotta ravioli with Lemmon sauce and red pepper weren’t up to the concept: raviolis were too cooked and the Lemmon sauce didn’t taste very much. My friends took the pasta with Tartuffo which is pasta fresca with peeled truffle, and an egg yolk to mix as soon as it arrives on the table. The said that they liked it. Didn’t try. And at last but not least the Pannacotta with mango sauce and seeds, which was excellent. Not still a four star but it is slowly arriving. Wine for me was a very good Nero d’Avola.

This is a perfect option if you crave Italian food while in Madrid. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff is very friendly. The food was wonderful. For starters we had a perfect Vitello Tonnato (thin slices of veal, with a cream of tuna, anchovies and capers), and a beautiful Insalata di Asparagi e Gamberi Rossi (a salad with asparagus, shrimp, quail eggs and aioli with squid ink). Our main courses were two typical Italian dishes: La Nostra Carbonara (spaghetti with guanciale, Pecorino cheese and slow cooked egg), and Tagliatelle alla Bolognese. Both are very simple dishes that you can find anywhere, but these were really spectacular in their simplicity. At Gioia they really elevated the flavors of these two classics, we loved our food!!!

Villoldo was recommended. I was able to email the restaurant beforehand to check that they could both feed a vegetarian and they could fit us in. They confirmed both. On the evening it was a delight to enter the lovely (slightly out of town) restaurant as they had created a secluded private dining area for my party, which meant we could relax without disturbing other diners. Perfect so far. Then came the menu - great for the meat eaters but not so great for the vegetarian, as once we were there the restaurant waiters seemed to struggle with the concept (despite their prior knowledge and acceptance of the booking) BUT they did rise to the occasion and provided a vegetarian starter and main course. We did struggle a bit with communication (we didn't have much Spanish \ they didn't have much English and there seemed to be only one menu with an English translation but again, that added to the enjoyment of the evening as both sides tried their best. The meat dishes (especially the pork and the lamb) went down very well - a couple of diners even said they were exceptional.

It was convenient to our hotel, the food was better than average, the atmosphere very nice and the prices were reasonable. The grilled lemon chicken was excellent and worth particular mention. The wine list is reasonable (for Madrid), as well. One nice touch was that we got several ""freebies"" that added to the experience, both nights. We got the usual ""pre-appetizer"", but at the end of the meal, we got a dessert and an unidentified liqueur ""on the house"". They were unusual and nice.  As you know, in Madrid they eat dinner quite late by our standards, so when we showed up at 8PM, it was just about all foreigners and tourists. I'm quite sure the Spanish flock there later. Be aware that they charge a surcharge (10%) to eat at the sidewalk tables. We got the same effect (and better) by asking for a window table, inside, where we got both some air conditioning AND the street view, which was nice. (Preciados is a pedestrian-only street.)  While I would definitely recommend the restaurant, I thought the service was half-hearted. There was an English menu, so no real problem for a non-Spanish speaker, but the wait staff had virtually no English and I felt service was half-hearted and we were treated as a bit of a ""necessary evil"". I didn't experience this anywhere else in Spain and am very comfortable cross-culturally, even when not speaking the language so I don't think it was us. It may have just been a lack of staff supervision those two nights. So, bottom line, it's definitely worth a visit, particularly if you're in the mood for a really good piece of grilled chicken or steak. Just be prepared for a possible annoyance and go with the flow.",2010-08-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991438-Reviews-or270-Parrilla_El_Gaucho-Madrid.html,UID_29354,0.053,0.795,0.152,0.9833,0.1495098039215686,0.5553104575163399,0.6865588235294118,1736,152,0.0875576036866359,0,68,False,72,0.0754716981132075,0.0566037735849056,0.2830188679245283,0.0188679245283018,0.1320754716981132,0.0566037735849056,0.0566037735849056,0.0754716981132075,0.1698113207547169,0.0754716981132075,304,197,4.707236842105263,0,0,ate parilla argentin style grill meat twice madrid conveni hotel food better averag atmospher nice price reason grill lemon chicken excel worth particular mention wine list reason madrid well one nice touch got sever freebi ad experi night got usual pre appet end meal got dessert unidentifi liqueur hous unusu nice know madrid eat dinner quit late standard show pm foreign tourist quit sure spanish flock later awar charg surcharg eat sidewalk tabl got effect better ask window tabl insid got air condit street view nice preciado pedestrian street would definit recommend restaur thought servic half heart english menu real problem non spanish speaker wait staff virtual english felt servic half heart treat bit necessari evil experi anywher els spain comfort cross cultur even speak languag think us may lack staff supervis two night bottom line definit worth visit particularli mood realli good piec grill chicken steak prepar possibl annoy go flow,average review,3

Everything, starting with the bred which we could smell entering is home made (or at least tastes as such). Very basic terroir food (I had an old style heavy beans soup) mixed with quite elaborated ones (my wife had squid on mesh potatoes mixed with oil and garlic). However, in general is mostly the older generations' menu. Which means tasty and full. Piglets in the oven and tenderloin ""on the stone"" were more then we should have eat. An interesting ""green"" wine (vino verde) from Castillia Vieja (the house wine) was quite appropriate with its fresh and dynamic aroma. Beware of deserts.

Well, this one actually does!!  This place is very unassuming and unpretentious with awesome food and service. They start you off with some bread and chimichurri sauce + some spicy olives. All this on the house!! We ordered the meat platter and a salad. Meat came exactly how we asked for - medium well. They were all falvorful and succulent. Salad was very fresh with a slightly sweet sauce which went perfectly with all that meat (see pictures of the platter and the salad).  We also ordered desert, a piece of cake with layers of goodness, forgot the name!! But they also bring you a glass of what taste like lemon sorbet which was good, again on the house (see pictures of the cake and the complimentary desert).  Staff burly spoke English. So what happened was that we could not finish our platter and told our waitress to box it up for take away. However, although she said ok ok, she tossed our food away. What gives them a 5 star for the service though is that, once they realized this mistake, they remade a small box of food for us to take a away - when they could have very well said, sorry there is nothing we can do about it!! Go to this place. Do not feel guilty about not eating 'Spanish food' only on your trip. There is so much Jambon and tapas one can take before steak and fresh salad becomes necessary ;) Bon appetite ",2018-07-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991438-Reviews-or40-Parrilla_El_Gaucho-Madrid.html,UID_29386,0.023,0.844,0.133,0.9837,0.2221195652173913,0.5630434782608695,0.3698823529411765,1470,133,0.0904761904761904,8,41,False,70,0.1,0.15,0.2,0.0666666666666666,0.15,0.05,0.05,0.0333333333333333,0.1333333333333333,0.0666666666666666,274,172,4.354014598540146,0,0,know time order food look anyth like pictur advertis order well one actual place unassum unpretenti awesom food servic start bread chimichurri sauc spici oliv hous order meat platter salad meat came exactli ask medium well falvor succul salad fresh slightli sweet sauc went perfectli meat see pictur platter salad also order desert piec cake layer good forgot name also bring glass tast like lemon sorbet good hous see pictur cake complimentari desert staff burli spoke english happen could finish platter told waitress box take away howev although said ok ok toss food away give star servic though realiz mistak remad small box food us take away could well said sorri noth go place feel guilti eat spanish food trip much jambon tapa one take steak fresh salad becom necessari bon appetit,good review,4

Conservatively decorated with an attentive 'old school' service this is a safe bet if you want to have a nice, basque style meal but will not break new grounds, neither in the presentation nor in the kitchen.  Sometimes this is a good thing and nowadays I'd rather have a place like this, where nothing disappoints, over another 'cool', trendy and completely interchangeable restaurant. I had a tasty gazpacho and a very nice fish (neither are on the standard menu). In both cases the food was one notch or two above a normal restaurant but staid just short of the gourmet level. The glass of white wine (had to drive) was also fine. Overall a nice solid performance. It should be underlined that the ground level restaurant is smoke-free which is a big plus for me.

The atmosphere was very low key and friendly, the place was full, and the table was ours for the evening to sit and chat. We started with the tomato-based gazpacho, which was excellent. We were given a choice of chopped vegetables to include in the finely puréed soup. Our decision to include all of the offered choices turned out well. Our entree choice was a sliced filet of beef with a mustard sauce. It was cooked to our requirements and served with potato slices and sauteed green vegetables. Portions were generous. The entree was more like very good home cooking than the more fussy version likely to be served at a high-end restaurant. For dessert one of us chose from among their interesting flavors of ice cream and the other a large dish of fresh fruit.

The restaurant was highly recommended by Hipólito at the Marriott Princesa hotel. The service was excellent. Danilo and Jaime were our very attentive servers. Danilo went over much of the menu in both Spanish and English. We ordered the sweet roasted green peppers with crunchy salt sprinkled on top. It was a huge plate and I figured we’d never finish them...but we did because they were so good. For our entree, we shared the corvino, which was very good once I sprinkled some lemon juice over it. We also had flan with raspberry sauce, which was very good. The people next to us had the oxtail that smelled absolutely delicious, which they said it definitely was. That’s what I’d get if we come back again on another trip.

Order as sandwiches or just as meat. You'll be glad you did. We got the Duo - basically a sampler of all their meats, with slices of several different cuts of steak and a couple of different sausages. All very flavorful. Also served with bread and tomato/mozarella skewers. Plenty of smaller options if you just want a taste or small typical tapas-sized portion. And if you want to do more of a tapas crawl, it happens to be very close to several other nice places, all just steps away from Puerta del Sol. We actually had planned on hitting several different places, but ended up just staying at Bayres. The sangria pitcher was great and a good deal. The service was top-notch friendly.

Our waitress was friendly despite lacking a good knowledge of English. An English menu is available upon request. My boyfriend and I wanted to try the suggestion menu for 39€ each, which consisted out of 7 dishes. Service was very swift and correct. Looking back, I believe this menu was one of the best price-quality we ever had so far! First dish consisted out of duck liver with fine slices of mango. A strange combination at first sight, but so delicious! Next were the jamon with tomato, a succulent fried gamba and piece of tuna, all three of them very delicious. First main course was a very tasty piece of merluza (the spanish cod) with vegetables followed by a meat course with deer and duck liver (a strange dish to be served in Spring, but oh so yummy!). Prices for drinks were ridiculously cheap: 2,5€ for a glass of very tasty brut Cava. We finished around 100€ for the 2 menu's, bread and oil service, 4 glasses of cava, 2 glasses of wine, 2 bottles of sparkling water and 1 cappucino / cola.

We booked online via Tripadvisor the day before, the restaurant had the booking and everything was really easy (even with my rubbish Spanish!). The food was good and the service was fine.

Because it was just fine.

We went on a Sunday afternoon...family day in Madrid. We totally lucked out getting a table without a reservation. Many large groups of families were there...it was fun to watch them. You can tell they frequent this place and the wait staff knew them. Great atmosphere, lovely place, very friendly wait staff, great house wine. For appetizers, we ordered two 1/2 rations: the cod croquettas and the anchovies to share. They were both incredible. I'd go back just for those. For our mains, I got the 1/2 ration of cod and my husband got the 1/2 ration of the ox tail stew. His was fantastic and mine was very good. The sauces are so tasty. Looking around at what other people ordered...it all looked great. The portions were very generous and everything (including bread) will fill you up. We wanted dessert, but didn't have room. We ordered cafe con leche which came with a large, curved almond cracker (which was like a dessert). The head waiter/owner came out and spoke with us and brought us the traditional after dinner drink. Don't be in a hurry...family lunch lasts about 3 hours....and costs about 30 euro/pp. What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

But it IS classical in the sense that all the boxes get ticked: well selected produce is prepared and presented with care, with attentive and helpful front-of-house staff ready to speed everything to your table. Basque cuisine is based on fresh meats, fish and seasonal vegetables. Here too, the menu reflects that background. My wife and I have dined here four times and we still have yet to cover the full range on the menu. The wine lists are detailed and wide-ranging, with some rather ordinary wines nestled in among the better ones. And being Basque there is some cider too. One tip: if you would like to try the Dantxari's renowned rendering of apple tart, order it at the beginning of your meal: it takes a while to prepare... and is worth the wait. Another tip: even in these economically depressed times it is best to book a table in advance.

It is a haunt for many Madrileños, and those, like my wife and I who live further south in the country, return on culture trips. Basque people eat well, and the menu at Dantxari reflects this. Hearty meat and fish dishes that reflect the lifestyle of those who live on Spain's north coast, are what are highlighted here. Service is swift, sure, friendly and yet unobtrusive. The advice of the maitre d', the sommeliere and probably all of the waiting staff, is excellent. What to ask for? Well, tastes differ from person to person, but we like their traditional sausages, their codfish dishes and their steak tartare. In winter their stews are highly recommended. The wine list is exhaustive, with good value wines as well as some that are harder to find (and thus more expensive) elsewhere. A final tip: at the very outset, tell your table server that you would like Dantxari's famed apple tart. This takes time to prepare, so if you forget, it might be too late to order later on. This delight is wafer thin and extremely habit forming.

No complaints at all about the service which was very friendly. Went for the Fillet steak which i would say was of average quality although at 17 euros was a fair price. All you got with the steak was bread and a bit of dip which was tasty. We ordered side dishes of baked potato with cheese and the Argentinian pasties which were both ok. Wine at 11 Euros a bottle was good value but meat came out on paper plates which i didn't really understand. Out table was o/s in the narrow alleyway which is a vibrant place.

I'll try to be as complete as possible and say right from the start: You'll love this place! So lets start at the beginning. Bayres Steak is a small Argentinian steak house, small meaning that the inside of the restaurant consists of a nice sized grill and three small tables for two. Now please don't let that sway you unless you're looking for a dining experience with candlelight and romance. Bayres has many nice sidewalk tables for four. You come here in the evening to enjoy the air, a bottle of wine and some great steak. Bring your sweetheart, sit down, and let Miguel your waiter, cater to you and offer some great suggestions to try. We tried the large sliced steak shown in the photo which was accompanied by two skewers of cherry tomato and mozzarella. We also ordered Chorizo sausage and a bottle of the Rioja. The Chiorzo was quite good and the steak was nicely grilled and very flavorful. We finished the steak and because it was so good, we ordered another one, but a smaller size. Afterwards we were offered a complimentary homemade cordial which was amazing. Lastly we had some chocolate cake and coffee... Total cost, about 45 euros. We stayed several hours dining here on the sidewalk, We enjoyed the food and Miguel's hospitality. We came back again another day and swapped the Chorizo for some Empanada which also was really tasty. Please don't let the idea that you have to eat outside and with paper plates turn you away.... You'll be missing a great experience if you do. We will come back again !",2016-05-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3674049-Reviews-or70-Bayres_Beef_Argentina_en_tapas-Madrid.html,UID_9784,0.013,0.831,0.156,0.9921,0.2405555555555556,0.4834240362811792,0.495464705882353,1598,131,0.0819774718397997,2,42,False,70,0.16,0.16,0.28,0.06,0.14,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.1,0.06,284,178,4.630281690140845,0,0,sever review bayr beef vagu incomplet tri complet possibl say right start love place let start begin bayr steak small argentinian steak hous small mean insid restaur consist nice size grill three small tabl two pleas let sway unless look dine experi candlelight romanc bayr mani nice sidewalk tabl four come even enjoy air bottl wine great steak bring sweetheart sit let miguel waiter cater offer great suggest tri tri larg slice steak shown photo accompani two skewer cherri tomato mozzarella also order chorizo sausag bottl rioja chiorzo quit good steak nice grill flavor finish steak good order anoth one smaller size afterward offer complimentari homemad cordial amaz lastli chocol cake coffe total cost euro stay sever hour dine sidewalk enjoy food miguel hospit came back anoth day swap chorizo empanada also realli tasti pleas let idea eat outsid paper plate turn away miss great experi come back,good review,4

The Parilla de Maria did look pretty good from outside, so we have choosed to give it a shot. We have ordered pasta stuffed with salmon and gamba-sauce (~17€) and wine(~17€). According to the prices, we expeceted a high quality dish but we were highly disappointed.  The portions we received were ridiculously small, so our plates weren't even half full. There were only like 8 tortelloni and 3 half(!!! yes, i said half) gambas on it. The sauce was ok but to call it a gamba-sauce is totally rip-off. The salmon-stuffing also tasted quite dry which made this visit a perfect waste of money. After we finished our dish we went on finishing our bottle of wine. The Service obviously wanted us to clear the table and constantly looked very mean at us when passing by and checked every 10 minutes nerved our bottle of wine if it's finished. As a customer that makes you feel very uncomfortable.  We are three persons, all students at the age of 25, so maybe they have taken us as a cheap knoff off customer which makes the restaurant even less recommendable.  There are so many restaurants in Madrid which are way more better in quality and price. So my advice to you: Spent your money and your hunger in a different restaurant.

By 7:30 pm we were very hungry and tired there being a six hour time difference from the US. We walked about a half block from the hotel and found El Gaucho...not very busy as you might expect! We sat at the bar and could see the everything including the grill. Between our host and the couple seated next to us we ordered what turned out to be a great meal. The servering sizes were very large and we could have shared one entre and a salad. Beef was cooked perfectly and side items as well. We ultimately ate once more at the bar and twice in the restaurant where Nancy and Juana gave us exceptional service. The bar is great fun and the restaurant is more quiet.

Dessert was tiramisu and the chocolate cake with the mint sauce. Oh my goodness.... Great sangria and wine, too. It was definitely pricey but we were on vacation and like to eat well.

The restaurant is very small, so you need to book in advance. I knew that it would be a great meal after we were served delicious bread and a small basket of deep-fried anchovies and calamari. My wife and I opted for the a la carte menu after being assured that the portions were large enough, and all three courses were inventive, beautifully plated, and even tastier than they were pretty. And the portions definitely were large enough. I started with the boletus con huevos trufados, which is a mushroom dish topped with a perfectly poached egg. This was followed by tuna, which was served appropriately rare but also has a nice char on one face. While my wife and I were both full, we had to get dessert, and the bunuelos de chocolate (chocolate donuts) melt in your mouth. It was a memorable meal, and we will be back if we return to Madrid A few tips for diners: We ordered from the a la carte menu since my wife is pregnant and could not eat the raw tuna that I ordered, but a few tables around us had opted for the tasting menu, which was served family style and both looked and smelled delicious. The portions also seemed large, so you definitely won't go hungry. Also, while it might not be on the menu, the restaurant has very affordable and tasty glasses of house wine if you are not with enough people to order a bottle.",2017-04-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d794471-Reviews-or30-La_monteria-Madrid.html,UID_29538,0.0,0.891,0.109,0.9819,0.2780781046910078,0.6166855724920242,0.43072,1477,143,0.0968178740690589,0,33,False,68,0.1219512195121951,0.1951219512195122,0.3414634146341463,0.073170731707317,0.1463414634146341,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439,0.0975609756097561,0.0,273,169,4.413919413919414,0,0,look fine dine experi near parqu de el retiro la monteria provid delici meal warm cozi atmospher restaur small need book advanc knew would great meal serv delici bread small basket deep fri anchovi calamari wife opt la cart menu assur portion larg enough three cours invent beauti plate even tastier pretti portion definit larg enough start boletu con huevo trufado mushroom dish top perfectli poach egg follow tuna serv appropri rare also nice char one face wife full get dessert bunuelo de chocol chocol donut melt mouth memor meal back return madrid tip diner order la cart menu sinc wife pregnant could eat raw tuna order tabl around us opt tast menu serv famili style look smell delici portion also seem larg definit go hungri also might menu restaur afford tasti glass hous wine enough peopl order bottl,good review,4

What I really loved is that as we were sharing they brought everything already split in two dishes and the portions were generous so we could try a few different things.

My dessert was very unusual, a half pineapple with custard inside it which I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed.

We were in for a surprise as it was a great night. It´s easy to feel you have come to the wrong place from the outside and the bar area but the restaurant at the back is a class act. It was lovely to be given a glass of cava rose each and then came the little toasts and the cheese dip along with shot glasses with pumpkin soup and some quality fresh warm bread and breadsticks all on the house. We ordered the parillada for three and as my wife doesn´t like blood on her meat they offered to cook half of the meat medium well. We ordered a Caesar salad to start with and it was pretty perfect with a sharp dressing and quite beautifully presented. The silver dish full of meats duly arrived along with some excellent asparagus from the brasa and a big plate of chips along with a choice of sauces. There was enough meat for at least one more person possibly two and if we return we will order for two rather than the three of us. The meats were cooked exactly as they were supposed to be and were good quality. The asparagus was worth writing a letter home about. We were far too full for deserts however the waitress insisted that she bring us some more offerings on the house including a delicious kiwi yoghurt and a Cava sorbet along with a bottle of something alcoholic to clear the palate. The bill came to a touch less than €100 and was extremely good value for money. I understand people giving this restaurant five star reviews and I agree that it really is a great experience but five stars for me has to be something absolutely extraordinary. ,2017-02-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991438-Reviews-or90-Parrilla_El_Gaucho-Madrid.html,UID_29593,0.014,0.767,0.219,0.9979,0.2978009259259259,0.6138888888888889,0.4258666666666666,1657,155,0.0935425467712733,0,13,False,69,0.15,0.1666666666666666,0.3166666666666666,0.1,0.1333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,315,188,4.26031746031746,0,0,want go vila brasil felt far chose el gaucho somewhat reluctantli surpris great night easi feel come wrong place outsid bar area restaur back class act love given glass cava rose came littl toast chees dip along shot glass pumpkin soup qualiti fresh warm bread breadstick hous order parillada three wife like blood meat offer cook half meat medium well order caesar salad start pretti perfect sharp dress quit beauti present silver dish full meat duli arriv along excel asparagu brasa big plate chip along choic sauc enough meat least one person possibl two return order two rather three us meat cook exactli suppos good qualiti asparagu worth write letter home far full desert howev waitress insist bring us offer hous includ delici kiwi yoghurt cava sorbet along bottl someth alcohol clear palat bill came touch less extrem good valu money understand peopl give restaur five star review agre realli great experi five star someth absolut extraordinari,very good review,5

We had dinner twice and we sat inside. In the summer there are tables outside, by the street.  The entrance is a little kitschy, but the main dinner area is nice, in a modern style. The food and specifically the steak was very good. The first time they offered a very tasty soup, on the house. The staff was very friendly. The price came to about 40-50 euros per person. I guess it is not a place for tight budgets and it has a ""cosmopolitan"" rather than a traditional Spanish style. We obviously had a good time and we went back one more time.

It was a wonderful experience, we went back the next day for lunch and again everything was excellent. You can't go wrong with what you order. We suggest trying the sangria, any of the salads, and the solomillo de cerdo (meat) , which is delicious and like butter. Their specialty is meat and fish.

Anyway the veg is now cold when the steaks arrive. I had asked for well done, it was rare, still with blood coming out and my husband wanted rare but it was blue, sill mooing I suspect. To be fair, my husband said he would eat his and I asked to send mine back, something I would never normally do. By the time it arrived, my husband had finished and the veg I had put on my plate, was now gone and no sign of any more. The steak was very good, but I had gone out to eat with my husband, not alone. For 2 steaks, 1plate of veg, 1 vodka/coke, 1 beer and a half bottle of red wine it came to €98 euros. Personally for that money I want great money and great food. It was probably worth €50.

We were the second party to arrive that night and we got VIP service from everyone. The waitress spoke english and so did the owner. They patiently explained what each dish was and when we ordered seafood, they brought out the raw fish to show us how fresh it was.

After that, we ordered the specialty of the house - apple tart for dessert and it was served with ice cream. Then when the coffee came, they gave us the almond cookie - which was very delicate and hot from the oven. Overall, the bill came to much more than we budgeted but it was well worth it.

As the name suggests, it serves traditional Basque food, and Basque food is allegedly the best cui-sine in Spain. Being located in a quiet street away from the usual tourist areas the clientele when we went was, with the exception of my wife and I, entirely Spanish. The ambience is traditional, rustic, Basque Spanish, wooden beams, oak chairs, gingham tablecloths. We would never have found this restaurant by ourselves. It was recommended to us by Spanish colleagues. We arrived at 21.15. We immediately felt rather foolish at having arrived at such an outlandishly early time….for Madrid. Apart from us there was just one table of 10 celebrating someone’s birth-day. However, by 10.30 the place was buzzing and by 11.00 there wasn’t a table free. The menu was very impressive and featured: soups, fish, meat and stews. We know the menu offered authentic dishes when we saw lamb sweetbreads with mushrooms, braised Iberian pork cheeks and boneless pork trotters. I went for fish and shellfish soup followed by lomo de ciervo con salsa de grosellas (venison in redcurrant sauce).

It was not like in the pictures, but small, thin pieces of meat instead. Will probably not try that one again. The chorizo was very good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The solomillo, however, was spectacular. We ordered ours blue, and it was cooked to perfection, very juicy and red inside. We'll definitely come back for more. All dishes were accompanied by one cherry tomato and a small ball of mozzarella cheese. We were not sure what to do with ours, so we just eat them. They were acceptable. The wine was also nothing to kill for, but acceptable for the price. We ordered the rest of our bife and chorizo to take away, but they didn't include one of the bife pieces not the chorizo in the small tinfoil package they gave us. A bag was not provided. Other than that, service was adequate and fast. The manager, who's Argentinian, asked us how was the meal at the end, so that was a nice touch.

We hadn't booked but it was no problem - presumably because it was far too early in the evening for locals (you'd be unlikely to see locals out for dinner in Madrid before 9pm at the earliest). The restaurant is bigger than it first appears from outside & decor is attractive. Staff were friendly & we opted for our waiter's recommendation of turbot shared for two which I believe was the day's special rather than a standard menu item. It took a while to arrive but thats in no way a criticsm. If I want fast food I'll go to an appropriate place - in a restaurant I hope to get a meal cooked with a bit of loving care in whatever time it takes & that's exactly what we got here. Our fish was really good & so was the accompanying wine (house as far as I remember). Can't remember if we had dessert (rare for us) but after our meal they gave us a (free) liqueur each. All in all a very good meal served by friendly staff in pleasant surroundings & not at all expensive either. If you're staying as were, just around the corner at Sercotel Suites Viena, I'd say this place is a must but even if you're staying elsewhere it's still well located - only around 5 minutes walk from Plaza de Espana metro station.

The place itself was pretty small. We were greeted by an elderly man who offered us the choice to either sit at the bar or at a table outside. It was November (and seriously cold) so I balked a little at staying outside, but the man assured us that the terrace heaters were on full blast and so we eventually sat on the terrace. I melted completely when the man came out, a few minutes later, and offered me a blanket to keep warm. That was the sweetest thing I could imagine.  Our waitress was really friendly and cheery and she explained to us that they're an ""eco"" restaurant, namely that they use sugar cane plates with bamboo sticks for cutlery and that everything is recycled. I'm a bit ignorant as to why this is more eco-friendly than reusable ceramic plates but I appreciated their preoccupation with staying green. She further helped me choose a steak that wouldn't hurt my teeth, since neither I nor my boyfriend knew the difference between the multiple types of meat on the menu. She also suggested some stuffed baked potatoes which we only said yes to because she was so nice - but we didn't regret it cause they were delicious.  The food was stellar, the meat was really tender and delicious, although the portions were a bit on the small side, especially if you're a rabid meat eater. I was full but my boyfriend was left feeling a bit peckish.  Our cheery waitress also offered us a couple of shots on the house before we left. I don't know if we did something special to deserve them or if they do this with all their customers, but I was fair impressed.  All in all, tasty food and the kind of service that makes you want to come back for more. I fully recommend it.

I got one plate for 18.5 euro, which is the same rate as at a main course in 3-4 star restaurant in Madrid. The plate was made of paper. It was not a restaurant, it was a very run down street grill, which luckily had good meat. Another sunny side of the story is that one of the waiters was very forthcoming and attentive.

It started with a perfect amuse bouche - a plate of fried sardines, cod, and squid. Everything was fried so perfectly that we ordered an extra started (calamari fried in olive oil - very good but not as the first plate). Porcini mushrooms with eggs and truffles were good; the portion perhaps even too large for a starter. Fried fish was as good as the one we started with. For the mains, we had oxtail (perfect), the Spanish version of risotto was juicy and tasty, and the tuna was fresh and of top quality. There was room for only one dessert (La monteria serves a variety of fantastic home-made sourdough breads which were simply too good not to eat throughout the dinner) and this was the dish I liked most: a cheese-based light cream, topped with a PX (sweet sherry) sauce and crumble, finished with grated parmesan (!). Very subtle, delicious, and innovative. For four people, the bill came to 170 EUR (including one bottle of wine).

Struggled slightly with the menu but the waiter gave us an English version which helped. With his help we selected the mango and foie, the fried prawns, asparagus, mushrooms with truffles and egg, seared red tuna and finally the beef fillet with foie. They also gave us the calamari with peppers and boquerones as we sat down. Portions were great and each dish was served separately to share and savour. At the end we couldn't resist trying the chocolate fritters with vanilla ice cream. With drinks our bill was €120 and we ordered at least 1 dish too many but I can honestly say that every thing we had was fresh and tasty with great ingredients very skilfully cooked.

We turned up 20 mins early because our 2 year old was tired from running around in El Retiro. We were greeted warmly and given a table straight away in the very small but fantastic dining room behind the main bar. The set up was quite formal, but everyone was very laid back - did not even bat an eyelid at my toddler. The very friendly waiter brought us a menu with English translation when it was obvious our Spanish was not up to par! The food was among the best we had in Madrid - we tried the red tuna (amazing!), mushrooms and truffled eggs (great combo) and ox tail (melt in the mouth). They were very helpful in that they served each dish up on two plates for me and my husband, so you don't have to fight over one plate! They were also kind enough to whip something up for our child, which she polished off in no time flat. We also shared a bottle of red and a dessert. Price-wise, we spent about Eu90 and felt it was value for money because of the amazing food - quality and quantity - and above all the service.

It´s out the way, 20min walk from the financial district, but through the park, which is a lovely stroll.  As soon as we pushed open the front door to the packed entrance the man behind the bar called out ""Come on in and have a drink at the bar"", really made you feel welcome.

We visited for dinner 3 times which may not be very adventurous but why change a good thing ?. Arrived the first night without reservation but they managed to fit us in after 1/2 hour wait at the bar. After that I realised it was best to book.  This is a busy establishment but service was 'at our pace' and the staff always seemed to find the time for some fun and language lessons. Menus in English if required so ordering was not a problem in any way.We alternated between fillet (solomillo) and 1/2 chicken (pollo) with lemon. The steak was really excellent, my order of 'well done' coming out just about 'medium to rare' in UK terms which is the way I like it. A mushroom and ? whatever sauce accompanied the fillet and that was also first class.  The 1/2 chicken with lemon had probably never even sniffed a lemon but was undoubtedly the juiciest, tastiest, chicken we have ever eaten. Both pollo and the solomillo were accompanied by patatas provenzal which was very tasty. Plenty of garlic on the patatas which I do not usually like but it just seemed to fit the rest of the plate. Overall this place rates a 'Magnifico' in my book and is well worth a visit, or two.",2013-10-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991438-Reviews-or210-Parrilla_El_Gaucho-Madrid.html,UID_29720,0.016,0.817,0.167,0.9916,0.2197368421052631,0.487719298245614,0.2547583333333333,1236,112,0.0906148867313915,0,34,False,51,0.1428571428571428,0.0857142857142857,0.2857142857142857,0.0285714285714285,0.0571428571428571,0.0,0.0857142857142857,0.1428571428571428,0.1428571428571428,0.0285714285714285,229,153,4.393013100436681,0,0,eat one highlight visit madrid visit dinner time may adventur chang good thing arriv first night without reserv manag fit us hour wait bar realis best book busi establish servic pace staff alway seem find time fun languag lesson menu english requir order problem way altern fillet solomillo chicken pollo lemon steak realli excel order well done come medium rare uk term way like mushroom whatev sauc accompani fillet also first class chicken lemon probabl never even snif lemon undoubtedli juiciest tastiest chicken ever eaten pollo solomillo accompani patata provenz tasti plenti garlic patata usual like seem fit rest plate overal place rate magnifico book well worth visit two,very good review,5

Strangely, this place was pretty quiet that evening - other places had more traffic. I choose an Empanada as the appetizer and the sliced filet along with wine by the glass. The server spoke ok English but was a little off-putting in his manner, but the service was fine. I snagged a table outside. They had little heaters to take the chill off which was nice since it was the end of October. The empanada was fine although not exciting (I picked a traditional hummus based Empanada so it was probably intentionally a bit bland). The beef was quite good - an excellent cut of beef cooked to just right. Other people already commented on the plastic utensils. They worked fine though.  Don't waste time on dessert - it is just stuff they picked up somewhere and wasn't the least bit interesting. The wine wasn't bad and the price was good - 2- 3.50 Euro/glass. They had both Argentinian and Spanish wine. While I enjoyed it and would definitely go back to this area to eat, I don't know if I found this place exciting enough to repeat given the plethora of cute little tapas places downtown Madrid.

Once they knew we could at least 'get by' in Spanish, the whole tone of the evening changed for the better. With all that out of the way, I can honestly say that we had a great meal here. We enjoyed some delicious vino verde and manchego cheese for an appetizer, and I had a really fantastic seafood saffron pasta dish.

So what do you do? You walk around, see places, see where the most people are, you do not want to go to those touristic places on Plaza Mayor, you want something more of what the locals would prefer. So you find yourself walking up and down those little alleys, full of people, full of restaurants, full of buzz and you're wondering what this ""Argentina en tapas"" place might be. Do you pass by and walk away or do you sit yourself down and give it a try?? Well, if you have the time+ability to look it up on tripadvisor, you're in luck. Cause then you'll make an easy decision: Sit down and enjoy! This is a very cozy little place, best visited in summer (I would think it's too small inside), there's tables sitting people both at the front and back of the place - suggest the backside alley, it's much better and more relaxed. The food is (of course) meat, and it's superb. We had the ""Duo"", which is an assortment of all kinds of meats served there, so we tried it all. There's nothing that was less than excellent, perfectly cooked, ""medio"" at the suggestion of Marcello, our super-friendly waiter - cook - bar tender. We also got the baked potato with melted cheese plus a salad, both very good. In terms of quantity, two 45 year-olds were super-satisfied. Perhaps a couple of 205 year-olds may have wanted a tad more food. The serving comes in funny looking paper plates, I guess there's some room for improvement there, however the food is so delicious you don't care about the plates after a minute or two. The sangria was delicious as well, and at the end we could not help accepting a couple of liquor shots, a treat offered to us by Marcello. As soon as we had them, he brought out the whole bottle, for us to have as many as we wanted! But after more than a liter of sangria we were ok. All this for some 36 euros. Most definitely recommended for meat lovers, there's no way anyone would regret this.",2014-09-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3674049-Reviews-or240-Bayres_Beef_Argentina_en_tapas-Madrid.html,UID_29735,0.035,0.839,0.127,0.9864,0.3636513157894737,0.5729385964912279,0.3546578947368421,2075,185,0.0891566265060241,4,88,False,96,0.1,0.2125,0.2875,0.0625,0.175,0.025,0.0125,0.025,0.0625,0.0375,387,245,4.364341085271318,0,0,walk around madrid day fun thing come earli even kind tire kind eager find place dinner walk around see place see peopl want go tourist place plaza mayor want someth local would prefer find walk littl alley full peopl full restaur full buzz wonder argentina en tapa place might pass walk away sit give tri well time abil look tripadvisor luck caus make easi decis sit enjoy cozi littl place best visit summer would think small insid tabl sit peopl front back place suggest backsid alley much better relax food cours meat superb duo assort kind meat serv tri noth less excel perfectli cook medio suggest marcello super friendli waiter cook bar tender also got bake potato melt chees plu salad good term quantiti two year old super satisfi perhap coupl year old may want tad food serv come funni look paper plate guess room improv howev food delici care plate minut two sangria delici well end could help accept coupl liquor shot treat offer us marcello soon brought whole bottl us mani want liter sangria ok euro definit recommend meat lover way anyon would regret,good review,4

We were attracted to this restaurant by the clearly advertised sign in the window offering a steak dinner for 9.95 euros. On being seated we were all given a complimentary glass of cava, which we thought was very nice. We were given the al la carte menue which was very expensive, we asked about the offer but were told it was not available at the weekend. We would have left but felt obliged to stay as we had accepted the free drink. We ordered from the menue and realised that the prices quoted did not include potatoes or veg,so making it even more expensive. The waitress seemed intent on us ordering drinks, we were asked three times, although we were still drinking the free cava, eventually we ordered water fro the table. I think the waitress may have been on commission and didn't think we were spending enough money as she was very rude to us all night, tutting and such like, reaching across people when they were eating and generally miserable.  The bill came to 100 euros including a cover charge of 2.20 Euro each for the bread and then a 10% service chare added. We paid the bill in full then asked to speak to the manager who didn't speak English, one of the other waitreses translate (she was very pleasant). He didn't seem bothered. On the whole i think you have to be spending a lot of money in this restaurant to get a half decent service.",2013-03-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991438-Reviews-or220-Parrilla_El_Gaucho-Madrid.html,UID_29743,0.029,0.857,0.114,0.9697,0.0667361111111111,0.5457638888888888,0.5156545454545455,1483,139,0.0937289278489548,0,29,False,54,0.1176470588235294,0.1176470588235294,0.2941176470588235,0.088235294117647,0.1764705882352941,0.088235294117647,0.0294117647058823,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0294117647058823,271,167,4.472324723247232,0,0,third even madrid satisfi eat buffett restaur previou even attract restaur clearli advertis sign window offer steak dinner euro seat given complimentari glass cava thought nice given al la cart menu expens ask offer told avail weekend would left felt oblig stay accept free drink order menu realis price quot includ potato veg make even expens waitress seem intent us order drink ask three time although still drink free cava eventu order water fro tabl think waitress may commiss think spend enough money rude us night tut like reach across peopl eat gener miser bill came euro includ cover charg euro bread servic chare ad paid bill full ask speak manag speak english one waitres translat pleasant seem bother whole think spend lot money restaur get half decent servic,bad review,2

Of the hundreds of small restaurants in Madrid, we found one of the best. It is also very close to Puerta del Sol, so visitors can find it easily. Jorge, the owner imports only the best Argentine beef, His crew carefully grills this to order, resulting in succulent cuts done to perfection. They are prepared one at a time, so lose your hurry up attitude and enjoy a vaso de Malbec - it will be worth the wait. Jorge makes a bold statement of sustainability with his table: your dinner will be served on biodegradable paper plates and the cutlery will be recylable organic plastics. This in no way diminishes the quality of food, but adds a socially responsible theme to the eatery.  Jorge has selected a brief wine list that includes superb Malbecs from Argentina. Try them, you will not be disappointed. They are fruity, and toothsome and stand up well to the beef. After two months in country, I can honestly say this is the best meat I tasted in Spain. Special thanks to Jorge and his crew for making this evening memorable.",2014-11-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3674049-Reviews-or230-Bayres_Beef_Argentina_en_tapas-Madrid.html,UID_29744,0.023,0.762,0.214,0.9917,0.3386904761904762,0.5877380952380952,0.2392636363636363,1125,92,0.0817777777777777,0,26,False,33,0.1296296296296296,0.1111111111111111,0.2962962962962963,0.0555555555555555,0.1851851851851851,0.037037037037037,0.037037037037037,0.0185185185185185,0.0925925925925925,0.037037037037037,200,143,4.625,0,0,finish km camino de santiago celebr madrid bayr beef restaur hundr small restaur madrid found one best also close puerta del sol visitor find easili jorg owner import best argentin beef crew care grill order result succul cut done perfect prepar one time lose hurri attitud enjoy vaso de malbec worth wait jorg make bold statement sustain tabl dinner serv biodegrad paper plate cutleri recyl organ plastic way diminish qualiti food add social respons theme eateri jorg select brief wine list includ superb malbec argentina tri disappoint fruiti toothsom stand well beef two month countri honestli say best meat tast spain special thank jorg crew make even memor,good review,4

More than once, we come directly from the airport with our luggage ! The staff is outstanding. Most of them have been with the restaurant forever... which is always a good sign. The maitres are extremely professional, having all learnt their office from the most prestigious tables in Madrid. The local is relatively small but welcoming and cozy. They just underwent a decoration overhaul which is charming and gives more light to the place. The food is close to what you could find in the best restaurants in San Sebastian or Bilbao. Not in vain has the basque cuisine be renowned for ages. The prime material are superb and the cuisine itself is exquisite and inventive without being over the top. Among the gems: the lasagna of Xanguro ( fresh crab), the Funghi Porcini with foie gras ( in season), the tournedos 'Dantxari"", steam cooked with a dash of olive oil, the Anglerfish ( rape) cooked with green garlic. The desserts are commendable, eg a fig pudding you will not find else where. The wine list is very well selected, flawless and affordable.

Ambience like home, cosy, could be for a relaxed lunch/dinner family or friends. On the first floor it looks more casual, on the second slightly more formal, could be also for a date! The food is very good, delicious! The service is excellent! There are mostly waiters of slightly older generation, feels like they have been there for ages and truly care for the service they provide. The only reason I am putting 4 and not five is because I think it is a little expensive for the portions it offers. I had a seafood soup 1/2 portion, a crab stew 1/2 portion and venison 1/2 portion, dessert and wine and paid about 55 euros! I think for half portions they costed too much for the quantity they put on the plate. Especially the venison was tiny little two pieces! Well the full dish was 4 tiny little pieces and costed over 20euros. I don't think it would be enough to make you feel happy and not hungry.

I am a student, so I wanted to impress her with a posh meal out but I couldn't afford to spend much money. Not only did we get a taste of traditional Northern Spanish food (not the touristy tapas you get everywhere else), but the service was exceptional. We got 3 half rations to share and although the choice of dishes and the size of the servings wasn't the best, the quality was undeniably brilliant. The Bacalao was perhaps the best dish, just in terms of taste, that I have ever had. The staff were friendly and were patient with my Spanish, allowing me to practice without patronising me in any way. At the end of the meal we were given a huge fortune cookie (literally huge) and 2 shots of beautiful flavored liquors on the house.

Once you walk into the restaurant you will encounter a common area where you can chill and drink standing up, but if you want to be a little bit more comfortable they do have seats and tables in the downstairs area.

First, the atmosphere and decor were simple, but friendly and warm. Secondly the staff were very helpful and patient (especially to those who speak very little and bad Spanish). Finally, the food. Oh my god the food! Neither of us are vegans by any measure but having had a lot of tapas on this trip it was really nice to have some well-cooked vegetables, not fried in loads of oil and dripping with ham or chorizo. We tried the mushroom croquettes, the potatoes with a vega sauce and the grilled vegetables and it was all incredible. We didn't try any of the desserts but again they looked amazing.

This turned out to a great opportunity to talk with the owner/chef who recommended the menu based on what was in season and the freshest.  We thus started out with sangria (of course) and olives from Seville (wonderful!) followed with the chef's first proposed dish: simple tomatoes in oil and salt. I was surprised but really enjoyed the taste and sweetness of fresh tomatoes with just a dab of oil and salt! (Note: it's been a few years since we've seen the summer...) We then shared grilled green asparagus and broiled white asparagus. Both were delicious and both surprised us as how simple vegetables could be so enjoyable when cooked right with simply a dash of salt and oil. We then had sea bass - simply yet well prepared in that there were no special spices other than oil and salt but it was the cooking of the meat that made it just right: pan-fried fish that was juicy without any other taste than the taste of the sea bass itself. We then followed with tuna. Now, though the bass was simple and delicious, the tuna turned out to be exquisite! It was served with a bit of teriyaki sauce and cooked just right as you could still taste the tenderness of the local tuna with the seared exterior. We then finished dinner with a cheesecake and an apple tort. The cheesecake had a distinctive touch which I could not identify but it was delicious. My wife's apple tort was again very tasty. In summary, of the three restaurants we ate in Madrid, this was the most delicious we had and we recommend Garcia de Navarra.",2013-06-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2490781-Reviews-or110-Vinoteca_Garcia_de_la_Navarra-Madrid.html,UID_29813,0.016,0.778,0.206,0.9973,0.2698051948051947,0.5484126984126986,0.5941642857142856,1716,162,0.0944055944055944,3,47,False,51,0.0869565217391304,0.217391304347826,0.4347826086956521,0.0652173913043478,0.108695652173913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869565217391304,0.0,311,182,4.517684887459807,0,0,made reserv suggest thought joke soon learn everyon spain eat alon restaur turn great opportun talk owner chef recommend menu base season freshest thu start sangria cours oliv sevil wonder follow chef first propos dish simpl tomato oil salt surpris realli enjoy tast sweet fresh tomato dab oil salt note year sinc seen summer share grill green asparagu broil white asparagu delici surpris us simpl veget could enjoy cook right simpli dash salt oil sea bass simpli yet well prepar special spice oil salt cook meat made right pan fri fish juici without tast tast sea bass follow tuna though bass simpl delici tuna turn exquisit serv bit teriyaki sauc cook right could still tast tender local tuna sear exterior finish dinner cheesecak appl tort cheesecak distinct touch could identifi delici wife appl tort tasti summari three restaur ate madrid delici recommend garcia de navarra,good review,4

As a wine lover I am always fond of restaurants where you have a great wine list. I have been to many and this one truly ranks among the best. I wish I knew a place like this one in my home town of Paris. We did not order specific food but the waiter offered us some sort of tasting menu where they kept bringing us small portions of sophisticated and delicious meals (especially the almost raw tuna which was unbelievable).  The best part was obviously the wine list which offers high quality and rare wines at very very fair prices, often cheaper than what you would find at a nearby wine shop.

Of our 8 day stay in Madrid , and enjoying excellent food, we were disappointed with Garcia de la Navarra. To be fair however, without knowing what was going on, we did notice other later customers , and possibly regulars, being turned away, which indicated to us that something maybe wrong? This venue seemed to be very popular in their bar, and especially by well dressed ""suits"" clientele. The street location of the restaurant is very pleasant but where we were inside was nothing special. Upon arrival we were seated on the high stools and table, in the front bar on one of three ""reserved"" tables, and not in the back restaurant area. It was very noisy and the table was small and not linen covered. The menu for lunch in our opinion is basic but had some interesting items like their stews. The wine list is HUGE , but not clearly labelled, and the pages are tied together, so you need a road map to navigate the choices. Fortunately we were assisted by a staff member who was helpful with advice , having asked him with what we wanted. We were served an appetiser of small crotons/biscuits with a slice of cured meat and cheese, which was welcome. The bread was not special and we were not offered water? For a starter I tried the ""Russian Salad"", which I needed to ask at ordering what it was. The salad is heavily potato based with other vegetables, and covered in a sauce. I found it a little beyond me to complete - which the choice was my fault. Our mains were the Cod and potato stew. The flavour of the broth, which barely covered the ingredients, was good and the meal was well cooked. The cod was represented by three small battered cod morsels, and relative to the price was not a stand out. Unfortunately the service, despite seemingly a number of available staff, was not very good. Even for our relatively small luncheon we had to wait main courses, which arrived separately, for drinks and cutlery.  A highlight of the visit , whilst waiting , was an unexpected return to Australian music nostalgia with the playing of ""Air Supply"" songs, which did pleasantly offset the bar noise.

The hotel concierge confirmed his opinion and we made reservations for the next evening. We walked in at 8:30 and it looked like we walked into a bar. But we were escorted to the back to a very handsome dining room and were the only ones there. By 10 pm, the place was packed! Luis, the waiter, came over and in his halting English, explained their menu and his suggestions. My wife and I immediately asked about the huge tomatoes we saw at the entrance. He told us they were from Northern Spain and we ordered a plate with onions and the house vinaigrette. Delicious! The menu is varied but there were also specials. My wife ordered the grilled bass with salt and olive oil and I ordered the tuna in soy. We also ordered various vegetables as Luis told us they specialize in the freshest in the market. The dishes were brought and we each ate quietly savoring each morsel of the food; that’s how very good it was. My tuna was rare in the center and so tasty. My wife’s bass was a half side of the fish perfectly filleted. The vegetables were extraordinary, tender and delicious. We had a suggested ’07 Rioja which went perfectly with the food. We finished with a homemade cheesecake and fresh pineapple washed down with hot cappuccinos. The entire bill including tax, tip and drinks was $145. It was one of the best meals we had during our entire 2 week trip.",2013-05-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2490781-Reviews-or110-Vinoteca_Garcia_de_la_Navarra-Madrid.html,UID_29833,0.0,0.842,0.158,0.9945,0.3076245210727968,0.5931800766283525,0.3665947368421052,1494,131,0.0876840696117804,2,29,False,55,0.0769230769230769,0.1538461538461538,0.3076923076923077,0.0512820512820512,0.1794871794871795,0.0256410256410256,0.0,0.0256410256410256,0.1282051282051282,0.0512820512820512,272,168,4.4963235294117645,0,0,driver take us madrid airport hotel opposit beauti retiro park first recommend restaur us hotel concierg confirm opinion made reserv next even walk look like walk bar escort back handsom dine room one pm place pack lui waiter came halt english explain menu suggest wife immedi ask huge tomato saw entranc told us northern spain order plate onion hous vinaigrett delici menu vari also special wife order grill bass salt oliv oil order tuna soy also order variou veget lui told us special freshest market dish brought ate quietli savor morsel food good tuna rare center tasti wife bass half side fish perfectli fillet veget extraordinari tender delici suggest rioja went perfectli food finish homemad cheesecak fresh pineappl wash hot cappuccino entir bill includ tax tip drink one best meal entir week trip,very good review,5

Everything was very tasty and well presented. I ordered a stew with potatoes and monkfish, which was delicious, though a bit salty (nothing to worry about). Dessert was delicious home-made rice with milk.  They boast an extensive wine list. It’s said that they offer 700 references. We ordered a bottle of red wine San Román (Toro), which was delicious.

We booked a table and when we arrived, we were warmly greeted and shown to our table. Thereafter, the service was great even when the place became very busy later in the evening. We went with some suggestions from the head guy (sharing plates to start with) and had some really delicious food. The croquettes were possibly the best we've ever had as were the anchovies with slices of tomato. My partner had deep fried hake and I had the most wonderfully tasty, filleted sole. Puddings were also good though not on quite the same level. This is where the review becomes a little difficult. When the bill arrived, it seemed a little high but nothing jumped out at me immediately as being wrong. Because I felt bad scrutinizing it so closely at the table, we paid and left but afterwards discovered they has charged us 16 euros for bread! Also, those lovely tomatoes and anchovies cost 24 euros which was the same price as my sole! On the menu, they were listed as 3 euros but that must have been for a single anchovy and a single slice of tomato - there were eight on our sharing plate. The bread charge was obviously a mistake but I did feel a little misinformed about the starter. Nevertheless, prior to that, we did have a lovely evening and, as other reviewers have said, the food and service are very good...maybe just check your bill more thoroughly than we did!",2016-09-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2490781-Reviews-or40-Vinoteca_Garcia_de_la_Navarra-Madrid.html,UID_19875,0.061,0.824,0.115,0.9355,0.175406746031746,0.4991732804232804,0.4057538461538462,1479,138,0.0933062880324543,3,33,False,57,0.12,0.16,0.24,0.1,0.14,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.08,0.08,270,178,4.481481481481482,0,0,read great review place realli want go especi near hotel book tabl arriv warmli greet shown tabl thereaft servic great even place becam busi later even went suggest head guy share plate start realli delici food croquett possibl best ever anchovi slice tomato partner deep fri hake wonder tasti fillet sole pud also good though quit level review becom littl difficult bill arriv seem littl high noth jump immedi wrong felt bad scrutin close tabl paid left afterward discov charg us euro bread also love tomato anchovi cost euro price sole menu list euro must singl anchovi singl slice tomato eight share plate bread charg obvious mistak feel littl misinform starter nevertheless prior love even review said food servic good mayb check bill thoroughli,good review,4

This restaurant is cheaper than the international chain, and the steaks aren't quite as good. That said I frequented this restaurant several times while I was in Madrid.

There is a warm, friendly atmosphere to the place, and it is nice and relaxed, somewhere that you could spend a lot of time of an evening! The staff were all very friendly and helpful, spoke perfect English to me once they realised I don't speak much Spanish, and were very helpful in recommending dishes. They gave me an English menu as well, which I definitely appreciated! Being there on my own, they sat me at the 'singles' table, so that when other singles arrived, we could all sit together and get to know each other, which I thought was a nice touch. The food itself was delicious. I had the mushroom croquettes which were simply amazing (they haunt my dreams!) and the courgette lasagna, which is cold, but none the worse for that! I also had the chocolate mousse, which I would highly recommend to everyone! But everything that came out of the kitchen looked amazing! Wine was lovely as well, of course!  I was told it was quite expensive, but in total my meal with 2 glasses of wine came to €24 including tip, which I thought to be very reasonable and a lot cheaper than the UK! The restaurant is on Calle de la Luna, close to Gran Via so it's easy enough to find.
