It was as though we were in a time warp. Nothing had changed. The décor was the same; the lighting was the same; the waiters were the same. Of course this is a good thing, since we like this place as it is. One imagines it has always been as it is now since it opened in 1941. We enjoyed an excellent melon with jamon appetizer, a plate of clams in “marinera” sauce (not at all like Italian marinara sauce; this sauce doesn’t seem to have much tomato in it), and a plate of oxtail stew. Everything was simply delicious. The waiter was attentive, somewhat formal, though friendly, and unobtrusive. We were there for lunch on both occasions, arriving shortly after they opened at 1:30PM. On neither occasion was the place particularly crowded, just nice and relaxed.

We ordered a seafood platter suitable for 4 adults and some octopus dish. This mountain of shellfish came out and was stacked with shrimp, prawns, crab, barnacles and some other shell fish. The seafood was served with nice warm buns and slices of bread with butter to provide some carb. My family love seafood, we really enjoyed the shell fish except the barnacles which is our first time trying it and did not like them. We requested the waiter to change the barnacles to prawn instead. The shellfish was just boiled and serve cold. Overall, we had a good fresh cheap seafood lunch which cost us less than €50. The restaurant was very popular among the Spaniards and is always super crowded. If you intend to have a meal there, you either come early or make a reservation.

The red cooked giant Spanish Gambas were piled on the entire big plate. They looked so lovely. We did not expect an order that big.  Oh boy…they tasted great! We both enjoyed them. We really wish we could try the dessert, but we were completely full.  The check amount was €32. It covered a bottle of wine, paella, plus Gambas.

I´ve been taking my GF to different restaurants all over the place and this one was without any doubt the best one! First of all I´d like to recommend all tourists here to download an app called El Tenedor because if you do so you may get a 50% discount as I did! To be able to obtain this discount the only thing you must do is to book a table through this app (the discounts may change over time). I booked a table for 3 for lunch on a weekday and we ordered wine, beer and several tapas. The tapas were mollejas, croquetas de mejillón, chipirones encebollados, rabo de toro y verduras a la plancha. Everything was mouth watering! The service was attentive, friendly and helpful and what to say about their typical dessert the jabón! A white chocolate mousse with essence of violet and lemon foam! I´ll defo go back here! 10/10.

It's creamy and soft on the inside and perfectly salty. If you're at the very cool Mercado San Miguel, have some vermut and burrata inside, then step outside and come to the very unassuming Bar Cerveriz for your tortilla. (It's on the side that is facing the paella booth in the market). For the uninitiated, Spanish tortilla (or tortilla de patata) is just egg, potato, and sometimes onion. One serving of tortilla is 3.50 euros.

High quality wine, delicious tinto de verano, excellent tortilla and jamon Iberico. Very warm and helpful staff. The proprietor was very friendly, explained to us a lot of things we didn't know about Spanish cuisine, the difference between jamon Serrano and jamon Iberico, the difference between sangria and tinto de verano, he showed us the typical wine used for tinto de verano, he told us all about Galicia, which is where he is from, and when we ordered several plates while seated at the bar, he dragged over a table to place next to us to accommodate the food. Definitely a highlight of our trip and glad we didn't waste our time at the mercado across the street.  It's very non descript from the outside and very small inside.

I have been to Sylkar, El Meson de la Tortilla de Gabino, Juana la Loca, and Bodega de La Ardosa, and Cerveriz and tried their regular tortilla de patata. This was a little bit of a letdown, especially since outside the restaurant they posted a survey advertising that they have the best tortilla in town (comparing it to some of the other restaurants I have visited), and I have to say it was not the best that I tried. Don't get me wrong, its still a good tortilla, but I didn't think it was as good as they say. The overall flavor was good, but a bit too eggy for me. The potatoes were a good texture and it's a good value for your euro.

Across the street we found this restaurant, by chance, and walked in on Tuesday evening about 10:30 for dinner. A marvelous experience awaited us. The restaurant is in the location of a former soap factory, and when renovation was under way, the original city walls of the city were found underneath. Now, you can dine on a glass floor over the city walls, a truly unique experience. The service attendants were excellent and the food some of the best we found in our month long trip in Spain. The bbq ribs were cooked three days at a low temperature and the sauce with them so good, we literally scraped the dish with bread. The most unusual desert I have experience anywhere in the world was served.

They prepare the typical tapas found all over Spain but give it a gourmet touch taking them to a whole new level! A not so known wine selection, but do not let this scare you off. I assure you will be surprised by the quality of the wines the carry. Which makes the whole experience more interesting.  I went with my family and there was not 1 dish which did not fascinate us. Literally one of the best meals I have had in my life.  To top everything off the attention that you get is amazing. I would even dare to say that it is the best you will find in all of Spain. Extremely kind staff and highly attentive waiters will guide you through the menu and give you historical data from the place where the restaurant is located and show you the ancient ruins it has.  If you want a nice night out and want to have amazing food don't think twice about coming here.

The food was really interesting, full of flavours and well presented. The portion sizes were right for us as at the end of the Tapas courses we felt pretty full. Just enough room after a requested time gap to share a dessert. Plenty of good wines by the glass to try out a number of Spanish wines. What took the restaurant to 5 stars was the service - everything explained as well as possible to two non Spanish speakers, attentive but not over bearing. I particularly wanted to try some Pedro Ximenez sherry with my dessert but was initially advised that they had run out - however the waiter went out and got a bottle from another restaurant when he saw my disappointment - service above and beyond! Price for the meal represented good value given the quality and I would definitely go again next time in Madrid.",2016-10-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2655778-Reviews-or50-La_Antonita-Madrid.html,UID_38892,0.024,0.877,0.099,0.92,0.1728354978354978,0.419047619047619,0.4334666666666666,1168,91,0.0779109589041096,1,17,False,59,0.175,0.125,0.3,0.05,0.225,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.05,0.05,214,145,4.462616822429907,0,0,book raini even septemb mani day c heat rather unassum entranc part boutiqu hotel la posada del dragon menu includ coupl fix price tapa option took lot roulett tapa order process went two fix price option side mix roast veget food realli interest full flavour well present portion size right us end tapa cours felt pretti full enough room request time gap share dessert plenti good wine glass tri number spanish wine took restaur star servic everyth explain well possibl two non spanish speaker attent bear particularli want tri pedro ximenez sherri dessert initi advis run howev waiter went got bottl anoth restaur saw disappoint servic beyond price meal repres good valu given qualiti would definit go next time madrid,very good review,5

First time was stunning, sat outside in the courtyard area, had amazing food and service. I had booked online and didn't realised but got a 50% discount which was a brilliant surprise!  Came back to visit on our last night due to such great experience (so booked online again). Upon arrival we were walked through the empty courtyard and directed to a table inside. (Note this was a quiet Monday evening). We were duly told that we had to sit inside (by the head waiter) if we wanted the discount and that we had to order specific courses and items off the menu. We couldn't understand why we were not allowed to sit in an empty courtyard just because off the online booking discount. We would have been more understandable if it was very busy but it wasnt. Unfortunately this tainted our experience.  It was redeemed slightly by the lovely waitress who served us, with great recommendations.  Overall very delicious food, just tainted by an unnecessary head waiter.

We did not look closely to note the details that this offer was on food only and not applicable to Chefs Selection section of the menu. Still a good savings. We tried the two croquetas on the menu, both of which were quite tasty! I had the Hake that came with ratatouille, both more than pleased the palate. The two deserts we tried was were the cuisine really shined...particularly in the white chocolate mousse, which I woudl describe more like a white chocolate ice cream accompanied by an interesting and impressive lemon foam. We also tried the Meille with quince...yummy! The hiccups included a bit of confusion in finding our reservation which we'd made about 15-20 minutes prior. We had to call up TripAdvisor on our cellphone and re-enter the reservation prior to being seated although we arrived fairly early, (~8:30pm, which by Madrid dinner time is early...many dinner restaurants are just starting to see their dinners begining about 9pm), Another interesting note was that the litre of sangria came with so much ice that it only provided about 2 to 3 comparable sized servings of the individual glasses of sangria. At 15euro for the litre and only 3.50 euro for a large glass serving, just order by the glass.  Bottom line, I'd recommend a visit if you make a reservation through TripAdvisor to enjoy a food discount but come prepared to show the reservation on your cell phone.

As this was to be the main meal of the day, we chose the dining room. No surprise that early on a Monday afternoon it was quite empty. We ordered the roast suckling pig, the monkfish, and red peppers stuffed with cod. I started with a cup of gazpacho. The food was wonderful, but beware if you're watching your calories because everything was super rich! The stuffed peppers were decadent, and practically swimming in clarified butter. The suckling pig was wonderful. The gazpacho was fantastic and very authentic. And the atmosphere was also delightful, rather opulent with the walls covered with interesting photos of the owner with various famous people dining there.  I have to say that the service we were given was truly exceptional! Our very friendly and attentive waiter made sure that everything was perfect. He happily prepared the monkfish for our friend at the table as it was served open grilled with a rather daunting appearance! I had a taste and it also was really wonderful. At the end, he even brought us each a complimentary sweet and rich liqueur. I've read reviews that say this place is inexpensive. They must have been in the tapas bar rather than the restaurant, because it was definitely NOT an inexpensive meal for us. With a glass of wine to start and two coffees to finish, the bill came to well over 90 euros.

It is tucked into El Latino and can be easily missed. We happened upon it after being unable to be seated in several other sites frequented by a younger crowd. This was a great find. The staff spoke limited English but their experience and limited menu made the night seamless. During our dinner there only 5 seatings. Our table of 8, another table of 8, two tables of 4 and a table of 2. Each table was provided incredible service. The patrons were as varied as a United Nations Conference. I was so impressed by the staff’s ability to serve persons of such diverse backgrounds with such ease and joy.  Do not miss choosing a Spanish wine for the start of your meal. The selections are small but pair well with the meal and are very nicely priced. The staff was ready to help with the selection. They also have sangria that looked marvelous but we were drawn to the wine selection.  Our group combines a variety of dietary demands. We have vegetarians, flexitarians, pescatarians and omnivores. This restaurant’s menu allowed us to satisfy all. We selected a wide range of options and even then we wanted more.  Chistorra—could not get enough;  Manchego Cheese—nicely aged, cut thin, topped with walnut halves and blackberry jam; Broken Eggs with Potatoes—a flavor and texture that calls for seconds, thirds and fourths and is still on your mind in the morning;  Roe Deer Sirloin—flavors and tender texture that is unique and compelling;  Veal Meatballs—a rich taste treat that moves ground meat to a higher plain;  Roasted Red Pepper Salad—a salad that was gone in an instant;  Spanish Potato Salad—unique and profound flavors that still linger in my memory (so different and a must experience dish);  Red Pepper with Cod Fish—a flavor that even our fish avoiders enjoyed;  Cup of Casserole of the Day was Lentil Soup—a rich and hearty soup that could have been a meal in itself.  I would go back to try several other options that did not fit on our table.  Then the dessert tray was delivered. The selections were many.

While we understand this is early based on typical Spanish times, the restaurant was in disarray. The tables were not set and, when our table was finally set, the tablecloth was still wet as if just pulled from the washing machine.  We then proceeded to order wine, water, and several courses. The wine was quickly delivered but the water required several inquiries.  The first course delivered was Tigre croquettes with a bland sauce. The croquettes were quite flavorless and the sauce did little to help.  Following almost immediately were the two vegetable courses, marinated heirloom tomatoes and grilled seasonal vegetables. Both were very good but were almost force fed in the apparent rush for the restaurant to be rid of us non-Spanish speaking interlopers.  Next we had the oxtail spring rolls, again based on a recommendation. And again delivered before we had enjoyed the previous course. These were rather nondescript stewed beef, wrapped in won-ton wrappers, and then served with two bland sauces that added nothing.  At this point, we requested that the pace be slowed since each course had been delivered with a Francoesque machine gun efficiency. We ordered an additional bottle of wine in the vain hope of slowing the onslaught.  Instead the Iberian Pork ""secreto"" (their quotes) with guacamole was forced onto our already crowded table despite our requests to slow the pace.  Finally since we had apparently crossed some Euro threshold, we were allowed to finish our (though now cold) meal in peace.  When asked about desert. We opted for the ""soap"" again based on a recommendation. The dish consisted of a lemon foam (hence the soap) with a central cake of lavender infused ice cream. Quite tasty but not worth the mediocrity of the food or the forced march pace by the kitchen and wait staff. The pricing was fair but overall not a good experience. We will not return given the richness of restaurants in Madrid that respect both the cuisine and the customer.

If you expect English, perhaps stay near the tourist traps like the Plaza Mayor, McDonalds or KFC. The Spanish dining culture is different- they tend to eat later.

A real nasty surprice came at the end - they've added to the bill extra €2 ""for bread"" which I didn't order. They refused to take it from the bill on my request stating that they always add bread charge ""per table"". That again, was the only experience of this kind during the trip - in all the other places things like bread, oil for salad etc have never been billed separately.

The skin that should be crispy was totally burned, a third of it was black and I had to cut it out and leave it on the plate. I have eaten cochinillo quite a few times in Spain and this was without any qualification the worst. The good ambience could not make up for the taste of soot in my mouth.

We were sat in the bar area not the main restaurant section which had space (Only 2 of us).

The staff seemed to just shout at each other... a lot and then our food came - hubby ordered paella which came immediately and I had a tomatoe & egg dish which came out a little while after. Once finished our plates were snatched away, and we were ignored as staff flew past us almost spilling drinks and food on us at one point, with no apology!  Very disappointed as we are quite well travelled and I do not think we are the typical moaning type with too high standards, quite the opposite!

We were made very welcome in this restaurant having been drawn in by the live music. The evening started with a glass of sangria at the bar.There was a more intimate ambience in the reataurant part and the staff were very helpful. We followed their guidance and chose house specialities. We had oxtail roll-a wonderful crisp pastry surrounding a rich meaty ragu on a bed of potato puree. The mixed tomato salad with five varieties of tomato was divine. But the best thing was desert. The house speciality- a white chocolate and violet 'soap' served with lime foam- a quirky and very special play on the fact that the building use to be a soap shop.,2013-02-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2655778-Reviews-or160-La_Antonita-Madrid.html,UID_39008,0.0,0.828,0.172,0.9734,0.3661178107606679,0.5256802721088435,0.3410857142857142,702,60,0.0854700854700854,0,14,False,14,0.0769230769230769,0.2307692307692307,0.282051282051282,0.0256410256410256,0.2051282051282051,0.0256410256410256,0.0256410256410256,0.0256410256410256,0.0512820512820512,0.0512820512820512,126,90,4.579365079365079,0,0,visit teenag daughter girl outing made welcom restaur drawn live music even start glass sangria bar intim ambienc reataur part staff help follow guidanc chose hous special oxtail roll wonder crisp pastri surround rich meati ragu bed potato pure mix tomato salad five varieti tomato divin best thing desert hous special white chocol violet soap serv lime foam quirki special play fact build use soap shop,good review,4

We had a table on the glass floor over the exposed wall of the original city, nice to see it was too. A limited menu always appeals to me, less likely to be pre-packed mass market rubbish - and not disappointed at all. There is a 2 man 'hot pass' in the restaurant and more cooking and preparing out the back, but good to see them preparing some dishes in front of you. The tapas selection is not massive, but the cod tempura and shrimp fritters were great, in fact, we ordered on advice 4 dishes and it was fine for 2 of us.

We were six people dining this evening but this was something our waiter didn't regard as important as most of us were unable to eat our food at the same time as our table companions. Firstly my wife got her meal followed by me 10 minutes later. After 30 more minutes three of our friends got their meals. However, the last meal (which for the record were the same sort of dish as I ordered) apparently needed a very long cooking time. After 30 more minutes he got his meal, which of course was not prepared to his specifications.

Then, when we passed by Esteban something special about its looks made us get inside. It did seem quite pleasant - and it really was. We were made extremely welcome by the owner, a typical Spaniard man. His daughter (?), who was working as hostess, was incredibly polite. It's Esteban is a small restaurant with a few tables, a burgundy velvet curtain separating the bar from the dining room. The walls are full of historical and old pictures transporting us to the atmosphere of an old tavern. Nevertheless, this historical perspective does not make us forget the XXI century because at the same time we were invited to enjoy all the comfort that modernity offers. The food is absolutely delicious. Considering our 10-day trip between Madrid and Northern Portugal, Esteban was undoubtedly the best restaurant in my opinion. My dish was superb: 'Bonito del Norte con tomate' (Atlantic bonito fish with the best tomato sause that I ever have tasted). As a typical Brazilian I love white rice. Therefore I asked if they could change my order by serving the fish with white rice, which they gently did. My husband also loved his choice, 'Boquerones en vinagre o en escabeche' (fried European anchovies in vinegar) The wine list is very complete. Simply fabulous - an invitation to taste Spain at its best!",2013-11-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d987957-Reviews-or70-Esteban-Madrid.html,UID_39022,0.008,0.809,0.183,0.9944,0.3112265512265512,0.4343362193362194,0.224975,1440,110,0.0763888888888889,1,42,False,52,0.1521739130434782,0.217391304347826,0.391304347826087,0.0434782608695652,0.1304347826086956,0.0,0.0,0.0217391304347826,0.0434782608695652,0.0,249,180,4.78714859437751,0,0,first husband look differ restaur one previous chosen idea go pass esteban someth special look made us get insid seem quit pleasant realli made extrem welcom owner typic spaniard man daughter work hostess incred polit esteban small restaur tabl burgundi velvet curtain separ bar dine room wall full histor old pictur transport us atmospher old tavern nevertheless histor perspect make us forget xxi centuri time invit enjoy comfort modern offer food absolut delici consid day trip madrid northern portug esteban undoubtedli best restaur opinion dish superb bonito del nort con tomat atlant bonito fish best tomato saus ever tast typic brazilian love white rice therefor ask could chang order serv fish white rice gentli husband also love choic boqueron en vinagr en escabech fri european anchovi vinegar wine list complet simpli fabul invit tast spain best,very good review,5

We wanted it to be not overtly touristy but with restaurant facilities so we could enjoy a leisurely Sunday lunch. This was always going to be a risky business as most places that are any good are generally fully booked for Sunday lunch. And so after a couple of knock backs from fully booked restaurants we found the last table for two at Esteban which was lucky as just after we were seated the place filled up as all the reserved tables became occupied. We had arrived at 2.30 pm and the locals turned up in force at 3.00 pm. From beginning to end we had an excellent experience, with the service being very friendly and relaxed with a menu in English being provided immediately and an English speaking waiter being assigned to watch over us. I would describe the food as very homely and the specialities of the house had obviously served this establishment very well for many years. The food whilst giving the appearance of being very simple was in fact well honed and based on good quality ingredients. We shared an entree of white asparagus tips and a main course each of bull's tail stew and home made meatballs. Perfect food that was very tasty but surprisingly light. Many tables seemed to be having the roast piglet or slow roasted lamb, both of which looked very nice. Wine choices were good with a small bottle of Cava for my wife and a good quality half bottle of red for myself. One desert, a digestive and two coffees later we ended up with a bill of €100 including a good tip. We loved the experience of being the only tourists in the house but included in a way that we too felt part of the whole Sunday family lunch enjoyed by the local Madridians that surrounded us. A great experience and based on our lovely afternoon we would recommend that you consider a visit to Esteban whilst in Madrid.",2013-10-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d987957-Reviews-or70-Esteban-Madrid.html,UID_39024,0.008,0.789,0.203,0.9983,0.2940674603174603,0.4789115646258503,0.3808714285714286,2028,180,0.0887573964497041,0,21,False,85,0.1313131313131313,0.1616161616161616,0.2727272727272727,0.0808080808080808,0.1919191919191919,0.0202020202020202,0.0202020202020202,0.0404040404040404,0.0606060606060606,0.0202020202020202,375,222,4.410666666666667,0,0,last day nine week tour itali spain decid spend first part day el rastro flea market madrid walk around la latina area choos place lunch random want overtli touristi restaur facil could enjoy leisur sunday lunch alway go riski busi place good gener fulli book sunday lunch coupl knock back fulli book restaur found last tabl two esteban lucki seat place fill reserv tabl becam occupi arriv pm local turn forc pm begin end excel experi servic friendli relax menu english provid immedi english speak waiter assign watch us would describ food home special hous obvious serv establish well mani year food whilst give appear simpl fact well hone base good qualiti ingredi share entre white asparagu tip main cours bull tail stew home made meatbal perfect food tasti surprisingli light mani tabl seem roast piglet slow roast lamb look nice wine choic good small bottl cava wife good qualiti half bottl red one desert digest two coffe later end bill includ good tip love experi tourist hous includ way felt part whole sunday famili lunch enjoy local madridian surround us great experi base love afternoon would recommend consid visit esteban whilst madrid,good review,4

You'll find the typical croquettes, cod and charcuterie here, but those dishes are given a more interesting twist while also being paired with dishes that have more contemporary culinary influences (superb salmon tartar, for example). They have an excellent selection of wines and  desserts. I didn't find the 'foam' dessert to be as amazing as other reviews suggested, but it was interesting and still worth trying.

It is located north of Gran Via on a corner in a colorful neighborhood (local fabric and hardware stores along with ""XXX"" bars). Like other reviewers, we were the only patrons at 9 p.m. when seated in a room on the main floor, but we watched a steady stream of regular patrons climb to the upstairs dining area. The restaurant is filled with old bullfighting photographs, programs, posters and paintings. The older man who waited on us, presumable the owner, could not have been more helpful. He gave us a table in a cozy side room that never became overheated, even after more patrons joined us. He gave us menus in Spanish and English then brought the album of photos to explain many of the dishes. He also brought a small serving dish of green olives that tasted of lemon or a light vinegar, and french rolls. We ordered a mixed vegetable plate (panache de verduras) which was served to both of us on individual plates and was flavorful (spinach, cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots) all evenly cooked and seasoned. I then had the lenguado plancha, described as grilled salmon but I think it was sole, the whole fish without the head, grilled to perfection with soft moist flesh. I boned it myself, but you might ask him to do it. It was served simply with a large wedge of lemon and another of tomato and a small yellow potato. My dining mate ordered rabo restofado, oxtail roasted and served with sauce, peas, carrots, and potato. He found it a bit fatty but enjoyed it. We ordered the house vino tinto (Rioja Bordon), something we drink at home. Chocolate ice cream (helado chocolato) was very good but not gelato. Our entire meal with cover and a bottle of water and coffee was 63 euros, served timely and with attentive but not hovering service. By 10 p.m. the place was nearly full.

For dessert we tried the fried milk and ride pudding.I'm usually not a rice pudding fan but this was so worth it. The presentation for the fried milk was entertaining. They fire it up when they put it on the table. It is heavy with alcohol that didn't burn off so i couldnt eat it (I'm allergic).It was even strong for my wife. They use an alcohol that tastes like black licorice. The flavors around it are good but the alcohol was overwhelming.  They gave us a shot of this Apple juice with the check that tasted wonderful.

And I enjoyed it a lot! We are not very big eaters, so we just wanted to order a paella, a portion of tortilla, and then by suggestion of the waiter, we ate a tapa of pork (I don't remember the name, but it was the first one of the menu section, with apricot jam).  Tortilla was huge for 3€! I could be full just with that. The eggs are not super cooked, but that's just the way I like tortilla, and I guess this is why some people say their tortilla is weird.... Then the pork tapa was super delicious, and much bigger than i expected, as I'm used to smaller tapas. Finally the paella was also good, although probably not the the best I've tasted.

Most of the patrons there are locals, but the waiter was very friendly and spoke English. We ordered Gazpacho, fried squid, and the grilled seafood plate (from the restaurant menu). Everything was so so good. The Gazpacho was refreshing on a hot summer night, we've had Gazpacho in restaurants in the State, it doesn't compare. We've had fried squid many times before, in the PNW where there is fresh seafood. However, the squid in Casa Gallega is so much tastier (they keep everything in the squid, including the squid ink).

However the initial disappointment fell away as we absorbed the atmosphere in this gem of a restaurant. The menu of mainly Spanish cuisine was varied and well-priced; the wine selection was very good and I would definitely recommend the Marques de Riscal 2010 which was a particularly crisp and fruity Rioja. The starters that were accompanied with olives and crusty bread were massive and absolutely delicious. And the mains did not disappoint either. Although there was not much space for dessert, these too are varied and well priced.

Every square inch of the wood-paneled wall is covered with paintings and black-and-white photographs. Most of it is bullfighting paraphernalia collected by the restaurant's founder, along with beautiful shots of old Madrid and photos of celebrities who visited Casa Salvador in days gone by. (The biggest names I spotted were Ernest Hemingway and Ava Gardner.) The layout is cozy and familiar while the waiters' pristine, white jackets let you know you'll be taken care of. The overall effect is incredibly charming, particularly for those seeking authenticity and one-of-a-kind venues. And if that's not enough to convince you, there's always the food! ""Merluza"" (hake, a mild white fish) is one of the specialties of the house. I generally find hake so-so -- but this was like no hake I'd had before! Fluffy, flavorful, lightly breaded and golden brown: yum! I couldn't get enough of it.

More recently due to my travels I am here at least once a month for the past 8 years. The decor is so incredibly homely with photos dating back over 50 years of bullfighters, famous faces, the staff and customers. The food is very typical spanish with a menu that has not changed much in the years I have been visiting. For that reason the food is prepared to the same excellent standard every visit with a sizeable menu to choose from. The owner/chef who unfortunately recently passed away, started as a dishwasher and moved up the ranks to eventually buy the restaurant over 30 odd years ago. His daughter has now taken over and, continued the tradition of offering great spanish food at great prices. The waiters all dress in traditional waiter uniforms from the 60's are friendly and helpfull in their suggestions to tourists of what to choose.

Located in the Chueca district this is a fairly large restaurant at least compared to most places where we dined in Spain and is relatively easy to find since it is located at the intersection of two streets. We did not have reservations but arrived early by Madrid standards (around 9 PM) and were seated in the upstairs area. The room was filled with many vintage photos of matadors and bullfights which I initially assumed were there for us tourists. My understanding though is that the restaurant has been around since 1941 and many of the photos have been here since the 40’s and 50’s, reflecting the interests and passions of not only the owner but the many locals who apparently eat here. In some respects it was like eating in a museum. A waiter quickly came to our table and provided us menus in English-yay! I ordered the Mixed Salad to start and the Beef Steak with Fries as my entrée along with a bottle of Moritz, the popular Catalan beer, something I enjoyed frequently during our days in Spain. My partner had the Chicken Croquettes followed by the Shrimp Salad along with a large bottle of Solán de Cabras, the premium brand of mineral water in Spain. Our food and beverages arrived promptly. All items were very tasty and well prepared; portions for each item were enormous. Because the meal was so filling we decided to pass on dessert even though what I saw others enjoying looked very good. Our total bill came to 51 Euros, which considering the quality and quantity of food we had I thought was quite reasonable. By the time we left, the restaurant was fairly full. Overall I thought this was an enjoyable place to dine and would recommend it to others.",2014-11-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2034008-Reviews-or100-Restaurante_Casa_Salvador-Madrid.html,UID_9432,0.0,0.868,0.132,0.9927,0.2262857142857142,0.5106825396825397,0.4067928571428571,1713,147,0.0858143607705779,1,25,False,68,0.1842105263157894,0.131578947368421,0.3947368421052631,0.0263157894736842,0.2631578947368421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,307,194,4.583061889250814,0,0,ate third night madrid locat chueca district fairli larg restaur least compar place dine spain rel easi find sinc locat intersect two street reserv arriv earli madrid standard around pm seat upstair area room fill mani vintag photo matador bullfight initi assum us tourist understand though restaur around sinc mani photo sinc reflect interest passion owner mani local appar eat respect like eat museum waiter quickli came tabl provid us menu english yay order mix salad start beef steak fri entr e along bottl moritz popular catalan beer someth enjoy frequent day spain partner chicken croquett follow shrimp salad along larg bottl sol n de cabra premium brand miner water spain food beverag arriv promptli item tasti well prepar portion item enorm meal fill decid pass dessert even though saw other enjoy look good total bill came euro consid qualiti quantiti food thought quit reason time left restaur fairli full overal thought enjoy place dine would recommend other,good review,4

First time was when I was starting a tour in Europe with a group of 7 people. I was looking for a restaurant by 10:00 p.m and everything was full. I stepped in and asked to a waiter if we can get a table. He told me he can get one for our group within 15 minutes but offered us immediately an appetizer, we decided to wait and right after short couple minutes he lead us to our table. This waiter made the night. His name is Felipe, gave us recommendations that we follow. No regrets with that. Everything was delicious and Felipe was caring of us very well. Other surprise came with the check, it was just 90 euros for the entire group.  Second time I went there when we returned to Madrid at the end of our tour. We were there again to celebrate my son's 9th birthday and Felipe was again taking care of us. Food was really good again and they had the nice detail of celebrate my son's birthday bringing a dessert for him, dimming the lights, putting a hat with lights on my son's head and singing the happy birthday (spanish version).

We sat down and ordered some wine. When we got the menu (which I was gonna use just to point out to the waitress what I wanted) I was rather disappointed, many of the tapas choices presented on the list outside the restaurant, were not on the menu now. I probably wouldn't have minded, except that all the options that didn't include meat, seemed to have disappeared, leaving me with only one or two options. The waitress seemed to seance our disappointment and started giving me recommendations that were not from the tapas menu. I ended up with some grilled tuna, which was delicious I must admit. My boyfriend chose some fried potatoes with eggs and Spanish ham and then some ribs and he was very pleased with his choice as well. The waitress was very helpful while we were choosing our food, but after the food was delivered, they seemed to lose interest in us, it was almost impossible to get any waitresses attention to order some more wine or water not to mention asking for the check. When we finally got our check I was a bit surprised that we had been charged for bread we never asked for, but I guess this is rather normal in many restaurants in Madrid. Prices are a bit higher than the average in Madrid, but nothing too bad.

The staff were very accommodating to some requests I made (Birthday ones, not snooty posh demands). They were friendly, chatty, easy going and were very good with their recommendations.

This was probably late for lunch even by Spanish standards but they were still offering the 3-course menu del dia at 13 euros. The first server could not speak English but another helpful staff came and explained the menu to us. My appetizer turned out to be prawns cooked in garlic with gulas (mock eel) which I didn't quite enjoy as I thought it would only be prawns. My main course of entrecot de lomo (steak) came with a large helping of french fries. The steak was a cheap cut and was thin and uneven in places so it was quite difficult to cook it evenly. My husband fared better with his choice. His appetizer of seafood paella was moist and delicious with a fair amount of mussels and prawns. He also enjoyed his main course of rabo de toro (oxtail stew) which was tender and juicy with fried potatoes. We were very full by the time dessert (tiramisu and cheesecake) was brought over. We were given a full bottle of house red which was included in the price. Total bill for lunch including a bottle of sparkling water and tips came to 30 eruos. I would still recommend a visit though my choice of lunch was disappointing probably because lunch was almost over and all the better dishes were gone. Service was great and I would give this restaurant a 3.5 star rating.,2017-09-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1775780-Reviews-or160-Taberna_Alhambra-Madrid.html,UID_39133,0.063,0.805,0.132,0.9692,0.1761047619047619,0.5337428571428571,0.4896076923076923,1340,112,0.0835820895522388,0,26,False,66,0.0888888888888888,0.1111111111111111,0.3777777777777777,0.0,0.1333333333333333,0.0222222222222222,0.0,0.0666666666666666,0.1333333333333333,0.0666666666666666,248,157,4.407258064516129,0,0,drop taberna pm visit museum probabl late lunch even spanish standard still offer cours menu del dia euro first server could speak english anoth help staff came explain menu us appet turn prawn cook garlic gula mock eel quit enjoy thought would prawn main cours entrecot de lomo steak came larg help french fri steak cheap cut thin uneven place quit difficult cook evenli husband fare better choic appet seafood paella moist delici fair amount mussel prawn also enjoy main cours rabo de toro oxtail stew tender juici fri potato full time dessert tiramisu cheesecak brought given full bottl hous red includ price total bill lunch includ bottl sparkl water tip came eruo would still recommend visit though choic lunch disappoint probabl lunch almost better dish gone servic great would give restaur star rate,average review,3

We were made welcome by the staff and on ordering a starter and 2 mains, the waitress advised us that this was too much and that we only needed 2 dishes. How glad were we for the advice. We had goats cheese to start, the portion was enormous and to be honest, a bit 'claggy'. We then had meatballs, which we love, again, the portion was massive. This left the meatballs a bit dry, smaller is definately better when it comes to meatballs as they tend to absorb the sauce better in our experience.

There's an outdoor section which is the courtyard of the hotel and the indoor section which has a glass floor showing you parts of a historic wall that used to surround Madrid. If you want to try something a little different than the traditional tapas that you can get from literally thousands of Madrid restaurants, then this is a good choice, although it is a little pricier than traditional places.

Our friend highly recommend Alhambra since it was close to the Westin Place - 10min walk at most. Even at 10pm (albeit Saturday night), there were tons of people crowded at the bar and all the tables taken up. We were extremely surprised when one of the servers said it would only be a 10-15 min wait. We got a table in less than 10 mins and ordered drinks right away.  Drinks: reason for the crowded bar is that draft beer (at bar only) is dirt cheap ~1.5 euro! We ordered beers only - local draft and bottled - 3 euro each. Pro tip: magnum bottles of wine and cava available and cheap if you're super thirsty.  Food: got the most non-tapas/Spanish items on the menu and it was the BEST choice of the entire trip.  - GARLIC PRAWNS/SHRIMP - peeled shrimp literally swimming in sizzling butter and whole slices of garlic. So good that we used the sauce for our bread instead of the olive oil.  - MEAT PLATE FOR 2 - do not order anything else in addition to this. It will feed at least 3 people. It included 2 different types of sausages, chicken, veal, and bone in short ribs with a huge side of French fries and chimichurri sauce. Beware the meat sweats afterwards.  Overall: 46 euro for 2 people with 2 beers each and we were beyond stuffed. Best meal in Madrid (sorry tapas)!

We happened to stumble in to Lamiak as we got to Cava Baja around the time when places were setting up for business but Lamiak had already been opened for a while. It was quite packed but we managed to squeeze our way in for some bar counter space. We had planned to just get a couple of drinks and then move on to dinner elsewhere but ended up hanging around once we saw some of the plates being served and so glad that we did! Unlike a few other places we've been to, the food was delightfully plated and looked delicious so we were sold on trying some out. We ordered the moussaka, smoked salmon, and a couple of variation of the bacalao. They were all wonderful. The drinks options were excellent as well and I loved how they were keeping tabs on all their patrons' orders on a huge sheet of paper behind the counter!

But very disappointing after having eaten a large meal with starters, main and dessert, to be told to leave the restaurant before getting coffee and a brandy, because we only could have the table for two hours and other people were waiting. We suddenly felt badly treated. We were not told before the meal, that we only had two hours, and we told the waiter. He told us that we could have coffee then, but there was no time for the brandy. We said that we didn’t want coffee if it had to be in a hurry and asked for the bill. We were brought coffee anyway and thought therefore that it was on the house as a sort of compensation. But when we got the bill we were charged for the coffee.

We asked at the reception of our hotel and Borja suggested Pelotari, so we gave it a chance. It is a small restaurant with an unassuming appearance. The food turned out to be great! The small dining room is decorated with images of pelotari, Basque men playing the sport called Pelota Vasca. Through a window, you can see the large grill with the hot coals and the flames beneath it. We could see a gentleman always busy, and he surely looked like an expert, moving very professionally in his kitchen. The menu offers many Basque dishes, and for some dishes you can order half a portion. Very convenient, if you are not too hungry or you want to try more different options! First they brought some bread and olives, and a few chistorras that were out of this world. Then we had a plate of excellent jamon and lomo ibérico and a tomate rosa (pink tomato) and bonito salad; afterwards we shared a rape a la brasa con patatas panadera (grilled fish with sautéed potatoes). We had the pleasure of watching the expert cook grilling our ""rape"". The fish was brought in small slices, incredibly flavorful and moist, and the potatoes were sliced and sautéed with onion. Awesome! For dessert we had the Pantxineta, a Basque dessert. The dough was formed by the thinest layers of puff pastry, filled with delicious pastry cream. A pleasure. We asked about the chef, and they told us that this gentleman has been cooking at Pelotari for decades. The owners wanted to sell, and he bought the restaurant. Now he continues to offer his Basque specialties, in his own restaurant.

She even warned me about the dish of tripe which I was ordering, but which I was determined to enjoy willy-nilly. My mistake, however, was to order a ""simple"" salad as a starter; it was huge! I consume tomatoes every day, but this salad's tomato slices plus green leaves on top of mt tripe stew was all too much, for I could finish neither. My advice: stick to just a main course.

Turning to the main course my wife had the smallest fillet which was cooked to perfection but was again a large portion. I was delighted by the special steak tartare which was made perfectly to my level of spice. All this rounded off with an inexpensive older Rioja which was selected from their list offered on an iPad which was a little different.

We arrived at about 9pm without a reservation and were immediately worried because the place was small and all the tables had reservation signs. The owner offered us a place at the bar which we snapped us because we really wanted to eat here!  We started with amazing margaritas: I had the Jamaican rose and my partner had a classic. These were really punchy and delicious, made by well-practiced hands! Our drinks also came with nachos and a beautiful tomato salsa. Later on in the meal we also ordered some Mexican beer, Pacifico, which was also very nice.  For food, we deferred entirely to the owner who explained that everything would be shared and took time to talk through the dishes with us. We had pulled pork tacos with red onion pickles, pork shoulder and guacamole tacos with a two chilli sauce and finally prawn and cheese quesadillas. Everything was exceptionally cooked and tasted sublime. I have not had Mexican food like this before and it was a real eye-opener. Our whole bill came to €55 which is very reasonable.

The restaurant probably hasn't changed much in the 200 years since it was founded and probably has an identical menu. The food was traditional, and hearty and was of course of top quality.  Due to the popularity of this restaurant it was unbelievably busy, noisy and cramped - it was impossible to sit at the table and not rub body parts with at least 3 others. However this is a minor issue which was outweighed by the taste of the food. I opted for lamb which from experience can be tough in Spain but the meat easily fell off the bone.

I would describe the dining area as very old fashioned and dated bordering on dismal .. During our very rushed meal we had to ask for our courses to be slowed down! Also a large set table next to us was dismantled and carried away and then replaced and reset for two tables of four instead, the banging and clattering was quite unbelievable for our Saturday night Madrid dining experience. It also showed that the tables are actually no more than plastic camping tables under white table cloths.. Food admittedly was 'ok' although by no means near as good as it should be for the prices .. We ordered prawns (small) in garlic butter from a verbal special of the day- had no idea of the price and was charged €18.50 each, I'd say they should have been half this price. My wife ordered angler fish and that was all she got and soaked in oil.. I had steak nice but literally served as a small piece of meat and chips no sauces no salad garnish, nothing!! 2 Bread rolls were on the table when we arrived these were then on our bill at €5! Wine and drinks were expensive.. And then to top it off a 10% service charge was added!! Total bill for the most average meal along with poor service and disruption was €156!!

From reading the reviews I clearly expected more. This is a restaurant with three small rooms, so the feeling you get when you walk in is that it is very small with tables very close one to another. The decoration is dark and really not appealing at all.  Now the food, I know that basque cuisine can be exquisite but this was not the case. The shrimp and fried peppers appetizers were very good. The artichokes very average. We wanted to order the grilled fish to share but my husband asked to see it first. It took them a while and when they brought it on a plate they turned the fish's hear away, as if they didn't want us to see if it was fresh or not. In the end we ordered it and it was good, but the service had prepared us otherwise. We shared two desserts. One basque one, that I don't recall the name but is the only one on the menu, was really good, with a thin, crunchy crust and a very fresh tasty cream filling. The apple pie was a disappointment. Finally the service was very weird. They would come and stand on top of our table while we were in the middle of a discussion, and interrupt us to ask if we wanted to order anything else.

For English readers of this review, locals know best! Not sure if this is in a tourist area as we were driven but it is worth taking a cab to. The restaurant felt traditional, certainly not pretentious and it felt very welcoming. The food was absolutely amazing in a simple no fuss sort of way. We had several courses (ordered for us) including an amazing salted cod that had the texture of thick cream and came with toast, fantastic. We then had a bream, it was cooked perfectly. I am now a bit of a food snob, I tend to cook so well at home that I only enjoy going to restaurants that create food that is impossible to reproduce. The exception is when I go to a restaurant that use great ingredients and keep things simple. I have previously reviewed Hooked in Windermere which is like this, now Pelotari joins it. I urge you to visit this restaurant, I doubt you will be disappointed.

Being Spanish, having lived in Madrid and liking Basque-style food, I thought I had been to every decent Basque-style Asador worth the name in this city, and Pelotari was not on my list. As things turned out, I was clearly missing one important name. I was entertaining a close friend who also loves Basque food and who insisted on going elsewhere (and paying the night's bill for having it his way). As I was visiting, he was kind enough to accept going to Pelotari, a place neither of us knew. The only condition was that dinner was on me. I'm picky with food quality, and Basque food leaves little room for concessions in that field, as food preparations are basic. You cannot disguise the quality of meat being served if it is just charcoal grilled and with some sea salt over it. No fancy sauces to hide bare bones reality. We settled for some appetizers. Jamón was exquisite, and salted anchovies were good without being great. A savoury and very convincing cod omelette completed the first round. Then came a big Chuleta (steak) to share. It was from out of this world. Meat was ably charcoal grilled, tender, savory, juicy. I'm running out of adjectives describing it. The BEST I've had in a long time. The meat was washed down with some nice Ribera del Duero wine. I found prices on the wine list to be adequate, whereas the wine selection was downright dull. Few nice bottles, and the one we picked was not available, so we had to settle for a second option. I guess the crisis has impacted the quality and amount of bottles restaurateurs keep in inventory these days. We had some desserts, not worth mentioning, and a not so great (our waiter pretended otherwise) gin & tonic to complete a great meal. To their credit, the cocktails were on the house, and not because we complained or anything. Service was competent and polite. It was a slow August Saturday when we visited, so I cannot judge how things will fare in busier days. Check came down to around 200 EUR, and wine was a third of that. Pricey, but money well spent. Dining room is on the classic side of things, and I did not like the lighting (no windows), but those were minor peccadilloes when thinking of how things fared altogether.

We had reserved online for 9 pm, but since we had only done it a few hours in advance, it didn't show up on their records. We had the email and text confirmation, of course, but it didn't matter because the place looked empty, which was a surprise. It turns out this is a really late place. When we left around 10:30 or so, the place was packed. A reservation is probably still a good idea. I ordered a half portion of delicious langostino salad and a half portion of pil-pil cod. The cod was ok, but pil-pil involved a thick tasteless sauce made from olive oil and something that made it thick and yellow. Not wonderful. My husband ordered a fresh, warm anchovy appetizer which he thought was ok, if a little bland. His main course was grilled Dover sole which was excellent. We had a nice bottle of Rioja wine for 25 euros. This restaurant is a bit more upscale than others we had been to in Madrid, so we expected the prices to be higher, but it was still just 90 euros, which right now is just over $100. The service was good and everyone was pleasant. They had at least one person who spoke decent English, so we didn't have to rely on our very limited Spanish. The theme of the place appeared to be jai alai based on the art on the walls, but it really had little to do with the food.

Being in Spain for the first time it would seem odd that we would seek a restaurant serving anything other than Spanish food, but I'm not too keen on pork and definitely not on seafood, so our options were limited. The Moharaj offered an alternative and we're familiar with the cuisine as it is prevalent in the area where we live in the U.S. The locale is clean and the staff is very attentive. We were seated quickly and our drink order was taken right away. The food at this restaurant ended up being the best Indian food I've ever had. The taste was not overpowering and they were willing to adapt the recipe to meet our individual tolerance for spiciness. The amount of food was more than adequate and the overall cost was a pleasant surprise, very affordable for a group of four adults (even after conversion to US dollars). I would have gladly eaten at this restaurant all five nights that I spent in Madrid. I would recommend it to anyone visiting the city. Sometimes the best gems are found in the most unexpected places and this one was one of them for me. Should I ever be in Madrid again, I will definitely seek out this restaurant.

It has a few low tables and stools in the casual bar area at the front and a more formal restaurant in the back. The ubiquitous jamón legs were hanging at the back near the restaurant entrance, and an interesting little dog/wolf fountain was on the left wall near the front. We arrived early around 7:30 to avoid the crowds and bellied up to the bar for a few minutes before a table in the bar section opened up. We ordered the vermouth for our first drink and weren’t disappointed. We were told by a friend that it is pretty strong, but it tasted almost like a refreshing soft drink with no bubbles to me. Very good! It was served with pork rinds which we have never tasted before and were not my favorite, but one of my teenagers liked them. We moved on to cañas (small beers which were delicious) and tapas once we grabbed a table for five. The croquettas were actually the best I’ve tasted in Madrid. If you want to live like a Madrileño, go out a few hours later (8:30 pm or later) and enjoy the vibrant, joyful city life, but if you like to be less crowded and soak in the wonderful atmosphere with a little less noise, join the tourists earlier.

We waited around 35 minutes. We were not disappointed! He fideo was so good! The second plate is enormous! I wish we would have shared! This is a typical Madrid meal, and from what we were told this isn’t served everyday. This place is awesome! Especially Alvaro Martinez Marín who was very friendly, helpful, and attentive! Can’t wait to visit Casa Alberto next year!

My son and I had visited on our first trip to Madrid last year and went twice. On this trip, it was the first place we took my husband whose enthusiasm equaled ours so much so we dragged our friends from Madrid the next night who admitted Casa Alberto has the best croquetas that they have had. While there are many tourists – there are many local people who come as well. The ambiance is very convivial. The waiter and barman are exceptionally professional mixed with a lot of fun. Prices are very reasonable. But what is most shocking is the quality of the food and the uniqueness of the menu. Honestly – it would take at least 10 visits to try everything. And absolutely everything we have tried there has been 5 stars. We have only visited the bar area as the restaurant menu did not appeal to us. Don’t be frightened of the wait for a small bar table – the people watching and Vermut makes the time fly.

I was looking for non-fried tapas, and something beyond toast and prosciutto. As a solo traveler eating at a table by myself can be intimidating but the atmosphere was super warm and inviting, and my waiter was incredibly nice. When you order a drink you have a choice of chips, olives, or pork rinds; I got the green olives. Ordered a bread basket (only 1€) and Rabo Estofado (tail stew).  For real, best thing I’ve eaten so far.  So rich and full of flavor, served with potatoes and falling off the bone. I was full after the first one but kept eating (serves 2). Two glasses of wine later my total bill was 17,60€ and totally worth it. Really close to Plaza Mayor and Antón Martín metro station.

We found the waitstaff to be friendly, fun and efficient, and loved the fried stuffed olive tapas. Sadly, that was the highlight of the meal. My salad of grilled peaches substituted canned peaches, without any warning or explanation, and the result was so far from the expected appetizer that it put a damper on the rest of the meal. We had two main fish entrees, each of which were utterly forgettable, yet expensive. We didn't linger for dessert, although the bar, always lively, was compelling.

I love starting an Indian meal with papadum. It's crispy and salty and not filling. A great palate cleanser. We are vegetarians so we ordered the Aloo Ghobi and the Chana Masala. We also asked for it to be medium spicy since we like a little kick. The dishes came with a few hot green peppers mixed in. By cutting up the green peppers, we could make it as spicy as we wanted. The Aloo Ghobi was one of the best I've had and with the extra hot pepper, perfect. My husband really loved the Chana Masala as well.

Made reservations via the internet since we were flying in that day and it was Saturday night. As such we wanted an early dinner (8pm). Showed up promptly and were told it would be 10 minutes before they could seat us, so they just left us standing there looking at the empty restaurant with the tapas bar behind us full of people. Finally took us to our table, but apparently a walk up with an 11 party group came in right after us and the waiter said 'oh we need to put you at another table since we need to pull these tables together'. Remember we had a reservation. Two other tables for two were set up, one by the hallway entry, which was very undesirable and another in the back corner which was quite nice. The waiter agreed to put us back there but actually said 'will you be done by 9:45 since that table is reserved'. So, we have a reservation, an 11 table walk up boots us out of our planned table and we are told we can't have the nice table if we are going to linger. One waiter working at this point. Fortunately we got an order in before he started with the 11 person table (not locals but Americans like us but with 5 children in the party). He had brought us some bread which is all we had with our drinks until a 2nd waiter turned up and suddenly brought out a little appetizer to both our table and the 11 party table. They had just finished ordering, but for us our food came out one minute later, so clearly we were ignored for 15 to 20 minutes and the service that should normally be provided was not. We had the meatballs and the ox tail. The meatballs were good. The ox tails, which as mentioned I've had many times, were ok at best. Decent flavor, but only three of them, which is significant since they are mostly bone and at least in many places a very cheap 'cut' of meat. When cooked properly the meat is supposed to fall off the bone. Two of them did but the third could barely be cut off. So a very disappointing dish. Based on our experience we would not go back.",2012-01-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or400-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_37503,0.048,0.852,0.1,0.9746,0.156717944753659,0.458361162646877,0.3774761904761905,2129,198,0.0930014091122592,0,48,False,98,0.0666666666666666,0.0666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0666666666666666,0.1,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0666666666666666,0.1333333333333333,0.1,411,232,4.182481751824818,0,0,saw posit review restaur like menu specif big oxtail fan tri countri visit made reserv via internet sinc fli day saturday night want earli dinner pm show promptli told would minut could seat us left us stand look empti restaur tapa bar behind us full peopl final took us tabl appar walk parti group came right us waiter said oh need put anoth tabl sinc need pull tabl togeth rememb reserv two tabl two set one hallway entri undesir anoth back corner quit nice waiter agre put us back actual said done sinc tabl reserv reserv tabl walk boot us plan tabl told nice tabl go linger one waiter work point fortun got order start person tabl local american like us children parti brought us bread drink nd waiter turn suddenli brought littl appet tabl parti tabl finish order us food came one minut later clearli ignor minut servic normal provid meatbal ox tail meatbal good ox tail mention mani time ok best decent flavor three signific sinc mostli bone least mani place cheap cut meat cook properli meat suppos fall bone two third could bare cut disappoint dish base experi would go back,bad review,2

The bhajee were great and came with some super sauces and condiments, the Jalfrezi was perfect too as was the rice. One sole downside was that the main arrived just seconds after I had finished the bhajee. I would have preferred a bit of time to digest the starter. I waited a while after the meal and decided to have a kulfi. This was good too, I ordered the mango version. The place was full of people from the British Council and expats, with whom I spoke. That must be a good advert. With a half bottle of wine, plus an extra glass, the bill was just shy of 30 Euros. A selection of flacons of ""digestifs"" was served at the end of the meal and it was left up to me how much I wanted to pour into my glass, which is a nice touch. I did not take advantage!

We also may have made an impression as they provided both our desserts at no cost! Having been around the world in many holidays l have not had many restaurants do that.  When the service is great and the food goes beyond your expectations it is easy to recommend a restaurant. Moharaj is a must visit if you want an awesome Indian meal. ,2018-02-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1047563-Reviews-or20-Moharaj-Madrid.html,UID_39392,0.015,0.647,0.338,0.9927,0.6,0.7307692307692307,0.501325,602,54,0.0897009966777408,1,10,False,29,0.1153846153846153,0.1923076923076923,0.3846153846153846,0.0,0.2692307692307692,0.0,0.0,0.0384615384615384,0.0,0.0,111,83,4.396396396396397,0,0,alway nice crave curri get reward great indian meal chicken lamb dish great lamb bhuna sensat servic also top notch owner happi chat recommend best dish also may made impress provid dessert cost around world mani holiday l mani restaur servic great food goe beyond expect easi recommend restaur moharaj must visit want awesom indian meal,good review,4

Perfect place to get a typical Spanish meal, reasonably priced and the food delicious! We ended up going there 3 times during my 2 week stay. There are actually 2 different sides to Alhambra - one side is for food and the other side, they call it a ""grill"" where they feature grilled meats. BOTH are excellent, but we preferred the ""grill"" side. You cannot go wrong with the salads, the typical egg/potatoes/prosciutto dish, the pork chops, the meat, the seafood lobster rice. The french fries were to DIE for! On the ""grill"" side, during lunch, they even provided a complimentary appetizer of the most succulent grilled chicken wings with the bread! Sangria was amazing. The included apple pie dessert put our U.S. apple pie to shame with the fresh apples that just made us wish for yet another piece, but couldn't because we were too embarrassed!

We were extremely taken aback but decided to stay to see if the food made up for it. It didn’t. It wasn’t bad but it was, well, meh.  So I would recommend that you give this restaurant a miss.

The building itself is an absolute beauty, from the red and gold façade that beckons you in, and the olde worlde bar area that wouldn't look out of place in a film. There's a plaque on the wall of the bar making the (somewhat dubious) claim that Cervantes completed one of his novels there, as well as the alarm-bell-ringing sight of celebrities who've stopped by. A good rule of thumb: if a place prides itself on the famous people who've ventured inside, it's probably mediocre. And so it proved. We wandered in and made a beeline for a table that had just become free, hoping to order drinks and tapas. We were quickly escorted away from those seats by a maítre d', hovering between bar and restaurant, who quickly informed us that he'd reserved that spot for someone else. Fair enough, of course, but we'd had no way of knowing that there was a wait. The kicker came when I approached him straight afterwards, asking him if there was a waiting list for a seat. ""Yes, young man, there are people waiting"" came the brusque reply, and off he walked, oblivious to our less than subtle indications that we were hoping to sit down at some point. So to the bar we went. The guy behind it, it must be said, was significantly more affable than his colleague had been. Still not quite service with a smile, but polite enough. We ordered a couple of vermouths (which were very refreshing, but at €2.60 each, were the most expensive we'd had anywhere in Madrid) and cast a glance at the tapas menu. Immediately it became clear why Alberto and co. did not list the prices of the food on their website: it's severely overpriced.  Madrid is an affordable city, with a host of cheap yet delicious eateries, so you would do an awful lot better than to eat here. Standing at the bar, I came within an inch of ordering a tortilla, until I saw someone at the bar request one, only to be served a paltry slice of something that looked as if it had been sat stewing all day on the bar. That fellow punter saved me a princely €7. You'd also expect that a bowl of six meatballs priced at €10 would have to be seriously high quality. But no sooner had someone else ordered them than you could hear the pinging of the microwave warming them up in full view of the bar. To charge so much and unashamedly deliver a microwaved meal demonstrates a complete contempt for the customer.  Oh and in case you were tempted to bypass the bar and head into the restaurant, many of the menu items are exactly the same, only with even higher prices. I wouldn't bet on the food not coming out of a microwave in there either.  We polished off our vermouths and took our custom elsewhere. If you're in the neighbourhood and fancy a bite to eat, head around the corner to Casa González instead. The fresh Spanish produce, beautiful wine list and fantastic service made that one of the finds of our trip.",2018-04-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or80-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_39406,0.04,0.869,0.091,0.983,0.1740802469135802,0.5756419753086418,0.420156,2952,267,0.0904471544715447,0,80,False,93,0.0875,0.125,0.3125,0.075,0.1125,0.0375,0.0375,0.0625,0.1125,0.0375,545,328,4.412844036697248,0,0,make place got littl bit big boot build absolut beauti red gold fa ade beckon old world bar area look place film plaqu wall bar make somewhat dubiou claim cervant complet one novel well alarm bell ring sight celebr stop good rule thumb place pride famou peopl ventur insid probabl mediocr prove wander made beelin tabl becom free hope order drink tapa quickli escort away seat tre hover bar restaur quickli inform us reserv spot someon els fair enough cours way know wait kicker came approach straight afterward ask wait list seat ye young man peopl wait came brusqu repli walk oblivi less subtl indic hope sit point bar went guy behind must said significantli affabl colleagu still quit servic smile polit enough order coupl vermouth refresh expens anywher madrid cast glanc tapa menu immedi becam clear alberto co list price food websit sever overpr madrid afford citi host cheap yet delici eateri would aw lot better eat stand bar came within inch order tortilla saw someon bar request one serv paltri slice someth look sat stew day bar fellow punter save princ also expect bowl six meatbal price would serious high qualiti sooner someon els order could hear ping microwav warm full view bar charg much unashamedli deliv microwav meal demonstr complet contempt custom oh case tempt bypass bar head restaur mani menu item exactli even higher price bet food come microwav either polish vermouth took custom elsewher neighbourhood fanci bite eat head around corner casa gonz lez instead fresh spanish produc beauti wine list fantast servic made one find trip,good review,4

We decided to go here because of the intriguing photo on the outside of the building of a woman with a gun in her hand, open blouse and a compelling face that had us making up many stories as we ate. We started with some of the servers recommendations. The chicken drummettes and wings were amazing, cooked to a perfection in a garlic cumin red wine sauce. The cold tomato soup (Gazpacho) was served with a cream base as it is in most of Spain. It was garnished with Iberian ham bits and shredded cheese. The tomatoes had no tell tale been in the refrigerator taste, which means it was very fresh, still cold and very satisfying. The 10 garlic prawns were enormous and perfectly cooked, not mushy and overcooked like so many places. They were the best we had in all of Spain. We then got the day's special, a huge steak which my husband loved. I was under the impression it would be chunks of beef in sauce but it was an inch thick and seasoned with garlic and grilled medium rare. We had this with some good local beer and were completely satiated. The ambiance of the place, the friendly server, extremely LOW prices and good food gives this place a high recommendation.

Old school tavern in Madrid just a short walk away from Atocha train station and Reina Sofía museum. It was packed on a random Thursday afternoon so I waited at the bar while a table cleared up for lunch.  I was immediately greeted by a small plate of fried pork rinds and a glass of house red wine. The wait went by pretty fast sube 15 minutes) and I was shown to my table.  In true European (and especially Spanish) fashion, the dining room was a bit too tight compared to what were used to in America but it doesn't feel crowded. If anything, it's cozy.  I knew I wanted the beef belly stew (callos a la madrileña) so I told the waiter to choose a starter for me. He suggested a wonderful plate of hummus and roasted artichoke hearts which was amazing. And beautifully presented. Light but flavorful!  Then came the entree... wow. I was blown away with how good the callos were here. Seriously. Perfectly cooked together with a small blood sausage, spanish chorizo and bacon. I'm still thinking about it... And what better way to end it than with a nicely prepared espresso and a slice of chocolate and hazelnut cake? I kid you not, every bite into this cake tasted exactly like a Ferrero Rocher chocolate. Inclusive of the crunchy bits and soft filling. Amazing.  I will be coming back with my family next week. And will certainly be redoing it whenever I'm back in Madrid.

We arrived early and we were able to relax and sit at the tables in front eating bread, olives and having cold drinks until the back tables opened up. The restaurant itself has been around a long time, serving bullfighters, literary types and of course, tourists. The place filled up quickly and apparently stays that way all night. We enjoyed our Gazpacho, salad, meatballs, sorbet, wine, coffee and more. I'm getting hungry writing this. We paid a total of $72 for all of that, not bad. You can spend much more but we were very satisfied. The waiters were friendly and the service was very good although our Spanish is limited to only a few words.

There is a lot of atmosphere here and it is worth visiting even if you don't eat.",2014-05-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6367286-Reviews-or8310-Mercado_de_San_Miguel-Madrid.html,UID_39438,0.049,0.786,0.166,0.9099,0.2666666666666666,0.5444444444444445,0.3504166666666666,453,54,0.119205298013245,0,12,False,25,0.0714285714285714,0.1428571428571428,0.4285714285714285,0.0714285714285714,0.1428571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714285714285714,0.0714285714285714,92,68,3.934782608695652,0,0,realli restaur marketplac focu food drink much time visit unfortun wish opportun tri food lot place look great tri chanc stop one place great locat plaza mayor near puerta del sol lot atmospher worth visit even eat,good review,4
