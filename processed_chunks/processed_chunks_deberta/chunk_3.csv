The tables are not too near to each other so not too much listening to your neighbour's issues. There is music (that I think is a downside) but not too noisy - a touch modern funky stuff? There are two branches and we used the one on a street south of the Plaza Mayor. It was open on New Year's Day - unlike many restaurants.  The food was unusual and fun. Look on their online menu and you will see that the chef is experimenting with unusual mushrooms and seafood. One of our party had excellent tartar and another sea anemone. We all liked it and thought it was nicely done. Chocolate dessert was stupendous.  We turned up at 9:30 and could hardly believe that we were not the first to eat - the place was already busy! We left after midnight and were the last to leave. Price was circa 180 euros all in for four with two bottles of pleasant Spanish wines. ,2015-01-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6498928-Reviews-or430-Metro_Bistro_Plaza_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_1778,0.023,0.831,0.147,0.9802,0.2381752305665349,0.4944005270092227,0.2714384615384616,925,85,0.0918918918918919,1,22,False,30,0.1153846153846153,0.1923076923076923,0.3076923076923077,0.0769230769230769,0.1153846153846153,0.0384615384615384,0.0,0.0,0.0769230769230769,0.0769230769230769,173,122,4.329479768786127,0,0,restaur unusu worth tri firstli logist tabl near much listen neighbour issu music think downsid noisi touch modern funki stuff two branch use one street south plaza mayor open new year day unlik mani restaur food unusu fun look onlin menu see chef experi unusu mushroom seafood one parti excel tartar anoth sea anemon like thought nice done chocol dessert stupend turn could hardli believ first eat place alreadi busi left midnight last leav price circa euro four two bottl pleasant spanish wine,good review,4

The menu has been designed for sharing, more than the typical option of a starter and a second dish by person. It¬¥s hard to define which are the starters and which ones are the main dishes, all options seem palatable. Also, each dish can be ordered in different portion¬¥s size, which I consider an excellent idea that allow you to choose according the number of persons you are sharing. The restaurant is small but cozy, with high chairs and tables, which gives an informal look according to the kind of food they serve, but never forgetting the quality and quantity. The waitress was very helpful and nice, her recommendations were delicious and she indicated us the best size of the portion for three persons. The most surprising dishes for us were the poached tomatoes filled with Idiazabal¬¥s cheese and the mini squid burgers, exotic mixture, but tasty. Also, the croquettes made with carabineros were soft inside and crunchy outside. Regarding the desserts they were correct, but we hoped more from them, due to quality and exotic of the other dishes.

We really enjoy the one by Temple Debod and this one was just as nice. It's larger and offers slightly different choices but everything we tried was of high quality and prices are reasonable for a city center restaurant.  The presentation of their food is excellent. For starters we shared the croquettas - which were definitely unique yet terrific. The humus was ok (a bit boring - it could use a bit of spice and more flavor and more pita crisps). Our main dishes were the steak tartar (very good) and the butter fish (good, but a bit too much ponzu sauce for me). For dessert we had the pineapple canelon which was very yummy and the apple tart was also good (very creative version but, for me, a bit too much liquor flavor and i also prefer my apples more cooked). Service was pretty good. We loved the little celery mojito they served and we like how this place opens early to accommodate those who prefer or need to eat earlier than 9pm.

The dishes are very unique. As seafood lovers, my dad and I both got the shrimp on fire as a starter, and it did not disappoint. The fire was cool, but we care about food quality, and the dish excelled there as well. The garlic flavor was strong but not overpowering, and there was a good balance of shrimp and mushrooms. It was a good start, but it got even better with the introduction of the elusive butterfish, which we hadn't been able to find for three years. It is, quite simply, one of the most succulent fish in existence, and the addition of citrus-flavored ponzu sauce somehow made it even better. This was simply the best meal we had in Spain, and every dish we had in the country was exceptional. The butterfish was that good. The price was reasonable as well, and a delicious dessert, ""Tribute to Chocolate,"" didn't hurt either. Bottom Line: if you like seafood, this place is worth it for the butterfish alone.",2017-07-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6498928-Reviews-or120-Metro_Bistro_Plaza_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_3000,0.023,0.677,0.3,0.9971,0.4668859649122807,0.5573308270676691,0.32159,1044,98,0.0938697318007662,0,34,False,41,0.0909090909090909,0.1136363636363636,0.25,0.1136363636363636,0.0909090909090909,0.0681818181818181,0.0227272727272727,0.0909090909090909,0.1136363636363636,0.0454545454545454,190,124,4.5,0,0,place locat less five minut plaza mayor lot better anyth find dish uniqu seafood lover dad got shrimp fire starter disappoint fire cool care food qualiti dish excel well garlic flavor strong overpow good balanc shrimp mushroom good start got even better introduct elus butterfish abl find three year quit simpli one succul fish exist addit citru flavor ponzu sauc somehow made even better simpli best meal spain everi dish countri except butterfish good price reason well delici dessert tribut chocol hurt either bottom line like seafood place worth butterfish alon,good review,4

From my Hotel window (Hotel Villa de Barajas) I spotted this small restaurant on very small street behind the Hotel - the customers at the outdoor tables looked so happy and the scene seemed very local compared the the restaurants on the main street in front of the hotel. So I went alone for dinner (on a Wednesday night). The owner/chef and staff were so gracious to this solo traveler with virtually no Spanish - super patient with me. The scene is casual and friendly and indeed many customers are locals of a range of ages. The interior is small, warm, a little hip and charming. They have a nice selection of beers including craft Spanish beers (wine too. but I didn't pay attention to it) and the food is great. I had mussels, sardine on toast, ensaladilla, Oreja (grilled confit of pig ear - hey, you're in Spain, live a little) and Torrenzo (fried confit of pork belly). It was all great - food that is regional and prepared with skill and creativity. The mussels, Oreja and Torrenzo were exceptional. The price is very reasonable - about 30 euros and I was stuffed.

Our concierge recommended La Cabana Argentina when we asked for a restaurant within walking distance (and told him that, after being in Spain for three weeks, we were tired of jamon); it is located on a charming, narrow street with several other restaurants. Golden light shines on the street through the big plate glass windows that display various cuts of steak, and the atmosphere is inviting: white-washed exposed brick featuring mirrors and old photos, charcoal grey leather banquets lining the walls, dangling lights, crisp white tablecloths. The service was excellent. Shortly after being seated, we were served bread and three kinds of olives. And the servers were attentive throughout the evening ‚Äì moving efficiently through the very busy restaurant ‚Äì but not cloying. And, the most important thing: the steaks were fantastic. A father and son own and operate the place, which has been around for more than 20 years, and import vacuum-packed Argentine loins and cuts twice a week. The quality is evident. We both ordered rib eyes and they were cooked a perfect medium rare and were tender and buttery. We share a massive salad with Roquefort cheese, walnuts, apples, tomatoes and a platter of golden, crispy fries. The wine list has a large selection of Argentinian Malbecs and Spanish reds, as well as a smaller but thoughtfully curated selection of other reds, blends, whites, sparkling (cava!) and dessert wines. Even though we were extremely full, we shared the dulce de leche ice cream ‚Äì three large scoops of rich, creamy, caramel delight. We were very content as we walked back to our hotel ‚Äì only wishing it was a bit further away so we could expend a few more of the many calories we had just joyously imbibed.",2018-02-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d796535-Reviews-or250-La_Cabana_Argentina-Madrid.html,UID_3069,0.021,0.808,0.17,0.9946,0.236416396103896,0.5044805194805195,0.4976428571428571,1793,131,0.0730619074177356,1,46,False,56,0.1276595744680851,0.1914893617021276,0.3191489361702128,0.0425531914893617,0.2553191489361702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0638297872340425,0.0,305,212,4.881967213114754,0,0,one best meal madrid first night concierg recommend la cabana argentina ask restaur within walk distanc told spain three week tire jamon locat charm narrow street sever restaur golden light shine street big plate glass window display variou cut steak atmospher invit white wash expos brick featur mirror old photo charcoal grey leather banquet line wall dangl light crisp white tablecloth servic excel shortli seat serv bread three kind oliv server attent throughout even move effici busi restaur cloy import thing steak fantast father son oper place around year import vacuum pack argentin loin cut twice week qualiti evid order rib eye cook perfect medium rare tender butteri share massiv salad roquefort chees walnut appl tomato platter golden crispi fri wine list larg select argentinian malbec spanish red well smaller thought curat select red blend white sparkl cava dessert wine even though extrem full share dulc de lech ice cream three larg scoop rich creami caramel delight content walk back hotel wish bit away could expend mani calori joyous imbib,good review,4

At first it didn‚Äôt look open, there is not much on the outside. Opens right at 8pm and only holds 25-30 people so fills quickly. The service was quick and friendly and they have an English menu if needed. Their food is spectacular and features a mix of solid Spanish classics and new twists. The mussels in kimchi broth were divine so save some bread to use to sop the broth us with.

What a place folks !! Waited a little while for a table but worth every second as the food is sublime. Started off with some bread and a little mix they had which was herbs, garlic and Oliver oil mixed together, on the bread it was awesome. Then into the plate of ham to share as a starter. Comes with plenty of ham (2 shared) and some toasted bread, again with the garlic it was lovely.  For mains we both ordered the rib eye (Angus) steak and it was perfect in every way. I love my steak houses and this again as in Romania is up with the very best. Served with a pepper sauce, fried with garlic and roasted red peppers it was such a lovely taste. Steak melted in your mouth, well worth the wait.  Cost:- well for all good, plenty of drinks it came to just ‚Ç¨120 which I may add was a snip considering how lovely it was.

I was looking for a spot with lighter fare options for a very late lunch and a few dishes on their menu caught my eye. So I decided to step in. First off, the staff here is wonderful. I was traveling solo (mid 40s female who only speaks about 20-30 words of Spanish), and from the beginning, despite my lack of Spanish language skills, everyone who works at this restaurant was very friendly and welcoming, and I did not feel at all awkward dining on my own or made to feel that I was holding up a table for a larger party. And judging by other people dining there, they serve a fairly diverse crowd. Service and hospitality was impeccable, efficient (without being overdone), and warm. Shout out to all of the friendly wait staff, and especially to Emilio, who offered a cinnamon-rice milk liquor to top off my salmon and avocado salad (which was also perfect). I also really liked the decor--it's warm, rustic, and very inviting. If you are looking for a change from regular tapas restaurants in the area (i.e. you are visiting the Reina Sofia or Prado Museum), I highly recommend this place. I would definitely go back again if I'm in the area and try some of their other dishes.",2018-07-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12442637-Reviews-or140-Oven_Mozzarella_Bar_Atocha-Madrid.html,UID_3125,0.006,0.832,0.162,0.989,0.2279464285714285,0.5302472527472527,0.3477545454545454,1255,114,0.0908366533864541,0,40,False,47,0.1272727272727272,0.109090909090909,0.2545454545454545,0.0545454545454545,0.2181818181818181,0.0363636363636363,0.0181818181818181,0.0181818181818181,0.1272727272727272,0.0363636363636363,229,152,4.4847161572052405,0,0,walk place glanc menu visit museum look spot lighter fare option late lunch dish menu caught eye decid step first staff wonder travel solo mid femal speak word spanish begin despit lack spanish languag skill everyon work restaur friendli welcom feel awkward dine made feel hold tabl larger parti judg peopl dine serv fairli divers crowd servic hospit impecc effici without overdon warm shout friendli wait staff especi emilio offer cinnamon rice milk liquor top salmon avocado salad also perfect also realli like decor warm rustic invit look chang regular tapa restaur area e visit reina sofia prado museum highli recommend place would definit go back area tri dish,good review,4

The waiter/host Ibrahim was very kind to accommodate us near the bar in a table for two. He was quick to offer us a courtesy taste of the pineapple daiquiri, the wine list and menu. Two other couples were sitting nearby. He took our order (and those of our neighbors) and shortly thereafter started parading our feast. We had the house red wine which was adequate, followed by an appetizer of croquettes which were recommended by Ibrahim. The corquettes were indeed fantastic. We also had the escalibada vegetables, but the eggplant was a bit too tough and it needed some sherry vinegar to enhance the flavor. That was the only part of our meal which was not excellent. We had the steak tartare and the braised lamb and both were amazing. To top things off, the chocolate extravaganza dessert was world class.

Coming in out of the cold and rain we were quickly shown to our table and seated. Menu with English translation and for a change, the waiters also fluent in English as well. In short. Meat is excellent, truly delicious. Side dishes, whether being roast potatoes or french fries with parsley and garlic leave much to be desired, but if you are here for the meat, their impression on your appetite is minimal. Did I mention the meat ? First courses are pretty standard, yet pave the way for the carnivorous experience beyond. A good steak and meat restaurant, overpriced, yet worth a visit.

Our host was gracious and helpful in explaining the small but perfectly focused menu. The food was like watching an excellent fireworks display with each dish exploding with new flavors and textures. This was easily one of the best meals we had during our two weeks in Spain. Highlights: Tomato Alinado: carpaccio like slices, in a lovely savory vinaigrette, with strategically employed salt crystals and topped with dollops of a berry cream emulsion. We used up most of our bread sopping up the marinade. Incredible!  Flores de Alcachofa: perfect flowers of artichoke, seasoned perfectly and topped with quail eggs and pancetta. Just fantastic.  Calimari: fried in a light batter and seasoned with just a touch of vinaigrette and hair thin strands of Chile pepper, Cilantro and Cucumber.  Oreja El callejon: perfectly cooked pork belly with an amazing crackling crust. Sinfully luscious! Purple salt added just the right punch.  We also enjoyed an amuse of patatas bravas which were spicy and incredible.  Our host was very helpful with selection from their small but well curated wine list.  All in all we cannot recommend this Taberna highly enough. We wish them success in the future. If you are flying through or just in Madrid for business / holiday.. this Taberna is well worth seeking out. Given their popularity I would recommend making reservations. We got lucky at 2:15.

It was an easy walk but at night, the last turn took us down a small street, better called an alley. Half way down the alley, as view from the street, we found the Taberna El Callejon. It is small but quaint. In summary, we just got back from eating at this Taberna and we are totally satisfied with this place. First of all, the Bartender/Server Alex made the experience what it was. He speaks very good English. He took the time to explain each item on the menu then made some excellent recommendations. Every single tapa we ate was excellent, beyond our expectations. We had muscles cooked in a wok and served in a delicious broth. My wife is not a muscle eater. But she tried these and has become a convert. Artichokes that were grilled and topped with a quail egg were again excellent. The croquettes de bacalaou (cod fish) were delicate and creamy. I would not hesitate choosing this Taberna again.

Other restaurants ranked higher in the area were packed and needed reservations. Metro Bistro had space and were very welcoming. It is not your traditional tapas/spanish restaurant you find in La Latina or near Plaza Mayor. It had traditional ingredients but reminded my wife and I of a smaller fine dining restaurant you would find in North America.  The servers spoke english fairly well and were very attentive and courteous. The music they played was also very trendy as my wife had to ask who the artist they were playing was. Order the assorted cheese, platter to start. The cheese selection is fantastic and goes well with the assorted fruit and house bread.  We also ordered the treasures of the sea. Which were deep fried escargot or muscles with seaweed salad. That was also very good, but not as good as the cheese. For entree's we ordered the steak tartare and the scallop risotto. Both were very well presented and the taste was excellent. The portions were not too large as we were able to finish them after our appetizers and not be completely stuffed. For dessert we had the pineapple cannelloni and the dulce de leche cheesecake. My wife was in love with the pineapple dish and almost ordered a second. The cheesecake was also very good.

There are four restaurants in Madrid if I am not wrong so I would check your closest one. Overall we would like to highlight the kindness of the staff, specially Emilio from Ciudad Real who made us feel ourselves at home anytime, helping us to choose among a wide range of burratas and giving us his firsthand recommendations which is always useful when it comes to visiting a restaurant for the first time. In relation to the menu itself, there is a wide range of burrata and mozzarella, a delicious melanzane (eggplant with parmesan cheese and tomato sauce) and something that caught my eyes was the basket of fresh homemade bread.  Taking into consideration that it is an Italian cuisine, I would say it is the best value for money.  On the other hand, If I had to say something to be improved would be the space between tables, unfortunately it is being something as usual as uncomfortable. Holding more capacity not always imply more revenues.

However, I have been studying abroad in Madrid for 4 months now and my family is privileged enough that I have been to most high end restaurants in Madrid. This restaurant is a sham and offers a terrible meal. The location is excellent (which explains the number of reviews) and the service is adequate. However, for the restaurant to rank #38 in Madrid gives the city a bad name. I could name 50 restaurants off the top of my head that are 100% better than this dump. The pumpkin cream soup was cold, the croquettes were cold and flavorless, the salad had no substantial greens or vegetables, the cheese pots consisted of two okay cheeses and 4 inedible ones. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY LOCATION!!!! THIS IS NOT GOOD SPANISH FOOD OR GOOD FOOD IN MADRID PERIOD! I will be contacting someone on trip advisor to ask how they can stand for such a terrible restaurant being in the top 100 restaurant in Madrid. This is an anomaly to trip advisor! We went to Takos Al Pastor right next to it after for $1 tacos and quesadillas and that meal was one of the better I have had in Madrid. Metro bistro is garbage. Do not give your business your money.

And at 38 EUR each its superb value. Service too was impeccable. Overall with wine and some fizz it was 108 EUR for my wife and I. The only gripe I really have is the fact Metro Bistro offers fine dining but is still a bit of a bar type vibe - I had music from the entrance in one ear and nothing in the other, I think some cool chill out music played throughout would add to the experience.

This restaurant has been established for some 20 years but was refurbished two years ago to great effect. The internal part rustic brickwork contrasts with smooth marble sections of the walls and gives a warm and comfortable feel. There is a relatively large seating capacity and it quickly filled with a mixture of groups and couples. The service, with some Argentinian personnel, was of a high standard. Paula's advice on the wine list was appreciated. Both the menu and wine list are comprehensive and easy to read. Of course the steak listing in the Menu is large with related meat sizes to show the extent of the meal. We were served olives, dip and bread to start. We did not require starters and went to the main courses which were either the beef tenderloin (300gram) or the rib eye steak.  The quality of the meats were excellent, and whilst nearly all of our party asked for the cooking to be ""medium"" the steaks were served more what we would class as ""rare"" in Australia. We were forewarned by Paula that the steaks would be cooked to a ""pink"" colour.  However all enjoyed the steaks very much and the accompanying saut√©ed vegetables, shared between two, were of good variety and servings. For our wines we chose an Argentinian Chardonnay and Malbec, both of which were reasonably priced and well suited our tastes. Overall a very enjoyable and memorable experience.

Otherwise it is almost impossible to find a seat. Like all restaurants in Spain, they are almost fully booked between 20:00-23:00, so either you have to visit earlier or book a table in advance. We have been to La Cabana to try steak and we did not regret it. We have been there around 19:00 without any reservation. They were fully booked for 20:00 afterwards and gave us a table on condition that we would leave latest at 20:30 which was ok for us since we had another plan later at night.  The staff was kind and friendly. But unfortunately not all of them could speak English. A waitress took our orders for drink and salad. When we asked a few things about the salad, an English speaking waitress had to come over to answer but it was ok. After our order was taken, a service plate with olive, a very good olive oil and some other oily spicy sauce was served to us. While we were trying the olive oil, a waiter came by and took our orders. We have tried two different steaks, one of which was recommended by the waiter and wanted half portion grilled vegetables. Though they were quite slow in serving and it took about half an hour for our dishes to be served, the steaks were really good. Surprisingly, the salad was above our expectations as well.

This place showed up on TA and we made our way to it. I don't know if it was just that we were cold and hungry, but we were, literally, blown away by our experience here. We were welcomed gracefully and warmly. Staff is unpretentious, kindly and efficient without being overweening. The food was excellent, from the bread box and butter cover, to the Cecina starter (which we shared), to my Perla Negra and My wife's Hamburguesa de Ternera, we just sat, ate and marvelled at the quality and the tastes.  The Cecina is thinly sliced cured veal with cream cheese and tomato. A fine blend of different flavours that lingered on the palate. And, there was lots for both of us.  My Perla was three scallops on a 'boat' of black rice in a shallow 'sea' of a curry sauce that was really quite indescribably good. I ate it all, savouring each bite and hoping it would go on and on.  My wife's hamburguesa was like no hamburger we have ever experienced. I have to admit that when I saw it on the menu, I began to have second thoughts about the kind of place we had come to. But, really, this is nothing like any other version of a hamburger we have ever seen. The meat perfectly seasoned, done just right. No bread, just finely shaped, amazingly crisp and tasty sliced of Yucca. (I know, who would ever have thought!) All put together beautifully artistically and very appealing. We had glasses of the house red together to start and I had a glass of house white and, really, if I had picked the most expensive bottles in the house, I could not have picked better myself. The d√©cor is clean, elegant and comfortable and matches the food. What I cannot believe is that (apart from a group of six Spaniards who came in to share wine and olives while we were there), we were the only people in the place. At 13:45, I don't think we were unfashionably early for lunch. Perhaps it had more to do with this being a Thursday on an exceptionally cold - and snowing - day when few tourists or Madrilenos were venturing out when they did not absolutely have to do so. I try not to give out five stars unless a place is really exceptional in our experience. There is just too much review inflation andhyperbole out there what with all the 'Amazing's, 'Awesome's and 'Fantastic's one sees over and over again. Let me just say this place is excellent and to be highly recommended. You are unlikely to go wrong. On food, on wine, or on the cost of your meal.",2017-03-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6498928-Reviews-or150-Metro_Bistro_Plaza_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_3210,0.029,0.825,0.146,0.9966,0.2202102330293819,0.6181003039513677,0.4406296296296296,2492,240,0.0963081861958266,1,79,False,77,0.1126760563380281,0.1971830985915492,0.2676056338028169,0.0422535211267605,0.2112676056338028,0.0,0.0,0.0140845070422535,0.1267605633802817,0.028169014084507,462,275,4.3896103896103895,0,0,snow madrid today walk cold place show ta made way know cold hungri liter blown away experi welcom grace warmli staff unpretenti kindli effici without overween food excel bread box butter cover cecina starter share perla negra wife hamburguesa de ternera sat ate marvel qualiti tast cecina thinli slice cure veal cream chees tomato fine blend differ flavour linger palat lot us perla three scallop boat black rice shallow sea curri sauc realli quit indescrib good ate savour bite hope would go wife hamburguesa like hamburg ever experienc admit saw menu began second thought kind place come realli noth like version hamburg ever seen meat perfectli season done right bread fine shape amazingli crisp tasti slice yucca know would ever thought put togeth beauti artist appeal glass hous red togeth start glass hous white realli pick expens bottl hous could pick better cor clean eleg comfort match food cannot believ apart group six spaniard came share wine oliv peopl place think unfashion earli lunch perhap thursday except cold snow day tourist madrileno ventur absolut tri give five star unless place realli except experi much review inflat andhyperbol amaz awesom fantast one see let say place excel highli recommend unlik go wrong food wine cost meal,very good review,5

But after much Spanish food in the recent days we looked for a steak house. Tripadvisor gave us the hint for this Argentine restaurant just 100 m away. They have a good choice of Argentine meat, different cuts and sizes of 300g or 500g. It was cooked as we wished (medium rare) and with different side dishes. Service was nice and attentive. A short advice: Even when you are hungry, share the salad with your partner, it is really large. If you intend to eat later than 21 o'clock, I think a reservation is mandantory. At the end we got a low bill for all we have eaten. Okay this is the sight of a Swiss and we have another measure.

If you're looking for either of these then you'll find them at Steakburger Atocha - and the quality is high! We booked off the back of the good reviews on here as were strolling around the botanical gardens, which are just up the road from the restaurant. The gardens, by the way, are well worth a visit. There were four of us and two had the chicken burger, one had the Mexican burger, and I had steak.  The steak was cooked really well, I asked for medium/rare and got just that, and the fries were great. It was just what I wanted to satisfy my steak urge! The burgers, I am told, were amongst the best they have had. The little pot of peppers which came with the steak are worth mentioning - they went really well with the meat and were something I hadn't had before with steak. So all in all we were very happy. As for the restaurant itself, a lovely atmosphere, not too big and not too small, very friendly staff and a house red which was delicious!

A warm welcome by the proprietor (even though we had not reserved a table), top notch service from the staff throughout the evening, and amazing, amazing steak - one of the best we have ever had.  It is a bit more expensive than many restaurants in the City (300g steak was just over 19 euros without any accompanying dishes which had to be bought over and above) but it was well worth it from our point of view; the welcome, the service, the restaurant itself, and the food were of a standard I would expect when paying that bit more.  I definitely recommend this restaurant for an evening meal.

The food that we got was tasty and plentiful, and the staff were friendly, but multiple logistical problems with the service made the experience somewhat disappointing. A high noise level (from other diners‚Äô conversations, not music) also contributed negatively. To begin with, the server (who spoke fluent English) said he could provide tap water with ice, but then brought bottled water at 2 Euros each. Not a big deal, since most restaurants in Madrid will not serve tap water anyway, but we should have been given accurate information. For food, we ordered a goat cheese salad, a red mountain burger, a melting cheese burger, and the marinated grilled chicken. The melting cheese burger never arrived. The serving of grilled chicken was so large, however, that by the time we realized the melting cheese burger wasn‚Äôt just delayed but omitted, it was clear we had enough food without it. When we pointed out the omission to the server, he apologized, removed the missing burger from the bill, and also brought us a complimentary dessert (a large, oven-fresh cookie with ice cream).  We get that in Europe, diners tend to linger in restaurants, and one has to ask explicitly for the check, but in this case we had to ask three times for the check, with long time intervals between requests. Again, not a big deal, but it reinforced our impression that we weren‚Äôt a very high priority table. The restrooms were clean, but down a long flight of stairs and therefore inaccessible to those in wheelchairs or otherwise unable to manage the stairs. The temperature in the dining room was pleasantly cool on a rather warm evening.",2019-06-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7225121-Reviews-or50-Steakburger_Atocha-Madrid.html,UID_3292,0.04,0.872,0.088,0.9336,0.0106097427476737,0.444127531472359,0.2814666666666667,1683,122,0.0724896019013666,0,45,False,58,0.136986301369863,0.1232876712328767,0.2602739726027397,0.0410958904109589,0.1643835616438356,0.0,0.0,0.0547945205479452,0.136986301369863,0.0821917808219178,287,188,4.86411149825784,0,0,late dinner steakburg atocha june food got tasti plenti staff friendli multipl logist problem servic made experi somewhat disappoint high nois level diner convers music also contribut neg begin server spoke fluent english said could provid tap water ice brought bottl water euro big deal sinc restaur madrid serv tap water anyway given accur inform food order goat chees salad red mountain burger melt chees burger marin grill chicken melt chees burger never arriv serv grill chicken larg howev time realiz melt chees burger delay omit clear enough food without point omiss server apolog remov miss burger bill also brought us complimentari dessert larg oven fresh cooki ice cream get europ diner tend linger restaur one ask explicitli check case ask three time check long time interv request big deal reinforc impress high prioriti tabl restroom clean long flight stair therefor inaccess wheelchair otherwis unabl manag stair temperatur dine room pleasantli cool rather warm even,bad review,2

When the burgers arrived, we were unpleasantly surprised that the meat was not simply pink, it was completely raw. On top of this, the burger itself was not warm. The friend who also ordered a medium burger had a decently cooked pink burger. One of the friends who ordered a chicken burger also complained about it not being warm enough.

It realy was a great food experience. The restaurant was modern but cosy. Every course was friendly introduced by Ibrahim.  We started with Artisan Croquettes filled with clams and Mushrooms and served with Catalonian Sauce and the Baked Vegetables Salad. Both dishes were great but the specialty from the house, the Croques were very tasty and original. For the main course we took the Gigot Lamb, Braise Butter Fish and Steak with purple French potatoes, I dont think the last one was on the menu. All dishes were great but we really loved the steak and Butterfish. At last we ordered the Triibute to Chocolate, which is really a must for chocolate lovers? Pure chocolate with Pepper, Truffles, Liquid chocolate. A real intens chocolate sensation.  Also the apple Tart Crumble was anything you would expect from a classic apple crumble but an original tasty creation. Altogether we had a great night and it has been a great food sensation, friendly guided by Ibrahim and the staff. Metro Bistro would be one of the main reasons to vist Madrid again.

One of our group walked past this restaurant during the day and said we should try it, not knowing how good it was going to be. A group of 6 arrived at 7.30pm with no reservation, I think we were the first diners there, but no problem, Paula our hostess arranged a setting for us. The restaurant at night, looking down the small lane did not stand out , but on arrival looking at the meat display in the window and the welcoming interior, one knew this was a restaurant operated by people that knew what it was about. This Argentinian Steak House had been operating for about 22 years and had been recently renovated to have an historical/modern theme which was very appealing and comfortable. All the right ingredients, Angus certified beef cuts, Argentinian Chardonnay and Malbec wines as will as Spanish offerings. The steaks were char grilled to European standards and very well too, but if you don't like really blue steaks then adjust your request from say medium rare to medium. Our group had rib eye steaks and tenderloins based on size of 300 grams and we added some share plates of saut√©ed vegetables which were fresh and delicious. Most had a dessert or cheese plate to finish and while we were waiting for our meals we had some bread, olive oil and olives. 3 bottles of wine, 3 beers, the meals and tip came to ‚Ç¨270 - ‚Ç¨90 a couple. I felt this was reasonable value given the service provided, the meal provided and the ambience of the restaurant.

We had Humous and Croquettes for starters, both were excellent and then Pork and the Lamb dish for mains. Both meat dishes the meat was cooked to perfection. We shared the chocolate dessert though think that was 90% for wife/10% for me! Excellent bottle of wine, great attentive service all night and just a fabulous evening.

The food on offer was exceptional. For starters we opted to share the cheese platter, the cured veal, the croquettes (filled with Mushrooms and Ham) and the sea treasures which consisted of deep fried anemones with deep fried seaweed and a seaweed tartar. The latter was the pick of the lot - although all the dishes were good. However the contrast of the hot and crunchy anemones with the cold seaweed was just too good. For mains I had the Steak Tartar which was out of this world. It came dressed with truffle, egg, foie-gras and vegetables - with the truffle being the pick of the lot. One of my colleagues also took this whilst another took the burger which does not come served in a bun however the taste of the meat is unlike any burger I have tasted before (yes - I did manage to steal a bite!)

I was counting on Bodega de Los Secretos (which I booked in advance to celebrate my mother's birthday) for the special meal (see my review) but Metro Bistro totally exceeded my expectations. The name doesn't give it justice - it is basically a gourmet restaurant (both in the sense of inventive cuisine and top notch service) at a ridiculously cheap price (for this level of cuisine). We had a 7 course tasting menu for 38 euros. We were the first people in the restaurant as we came at 7PM - we didn't have lunch and wanted to eat early; so we got so much attention from the staff we felt like at the Ritz. The presentation, the attention to detail, the great, yet unexpected combinations of ingredients (anemones with seaweed tartar and lemongrass took time to identify)... It all started with complimentary tiny celery mojitos and then one course gave way to the next one and next one. When we thought we couldn't possible eat anything else, the dessert arrived: pineapple cannelloni with mango source. The chocolate selection that accompanied coffee after that was definitely over the top. If you come here for that tasting menu, make sure you don't eat for few days before. The staff was wonderful, friendly and very professional: they explained every course in details, offered great wine suggestions and even packed the little chocolates for us to take away.  Just off Plaza Major, this fantastic restaurant is not to be missed.

Much smaller than Gran via, but food is as good as there. Smaller branch means less tables and in a way it did reflect on the atmosphere, which compared between the two is rather more settled down and quiet. We went for lobster ravioli (raviolacci de langosta) and beef ravioli (Ravioli de ternera braseada). The lobster pasta was very nice, with quite a hint of garlic, very tasty. I really loved the beef ravioli, with creamy sauce and sweet dried tomatoes. Very nice. I took also a margarita pizza to take with us as a little snack at the hotel and again, very good result. The dough is very thin, crispy and soft at the same time, coming with a bit of burrata melted on the top, with several basil leaves, leaving it with nice aroma.

Right from the moment we walked in, this place showed its class. Each of the wait staff we encountered was cordial, jovial and made us feel special. We chose the tasting menu for two of us, and a cured meat platter for our 4 year old son. We also requested them to replace one of the item from the tasting menu, and they happily obliged.

And, being North Americans, we appreciated being able to make a dinner reservation for an earlier time than the typical Madrid dinner! The cuisine was very interesting, featuring creative combinations of food which were healthy and delicious. We shared a starter of their featured sea anemone with Asian greens, after reading about it on TA. It was quite a treat and probably something we'll never get again. For our first course, my husband had the pumpkin soup with cream and cheese and he loved it. I had a salad with figs and goat cheese which was also outstanding.

The range of wines is impressive and the Malbec recommended was amongst the best we've had. Don't usually do deserts but you must try the apple crepe.

Some of the restaurants by the hotel looked nice but the reviews were not good then I spotted Steak Burger Atocha. The reviews were good and it was just round the corner. I didn't really fancy a burger but decided to give it a go anyway. First impression was good as we were taken to our table. Drinks order was taken straight away and we were given time to look at the menu. My fianc√© chose the Nachos to start and I had the chicken wings. The nachos was easily enough for both of us and were some of the best I've had. Could have been a bit spicier but my fianc√© saw to that with Tabasco. The chicken wings with the thick sweet sauce on the side were a star, sweet, crispy and cooked to perfection. For mains we both had steak. My fianc√© had medium and mine was rare and they were cooked to perfection. I almost went for the burgers but I am not a great burger fan as I like my Steak but when I saw some of them coming out for other tables they looked fabulous. Meal was finished of with Carrot cake and a complementary milky sweet alcoholicy drink which was really nice.

Our expectations were exceeded on every level, with just one slight disappointment. As a group of four, we chose the seven course tasting menu. Each course was explained in advance by a member of the very attentive, personable and friendly staff. Dishes were somewhat customized, in one couse i had abolene added to a rissoto while others had it without. Same for a course where I tried eel.. Every plate was delicious, artfully presented and bursting with great flavor. Until our last main course which was the one dish we all knew, it was a sampling of pork tenderloin. Unfortunately, we all found it slightly undercooked and chewey. However, by that point in the meal, we were just fine with a small taste. Again the meal as a whole was fabulous  Two different dessert courses finished the meal on a very high note. Each taste of the desserts was exquisite.

I opted for the 300g rib-eye and fries. I figured a bit of salad would turn it into something approaching balanced. the cost of the salad should have warned me about the size of it... everything was lovely and fresh and the oil / vinegar complemented it well but was a bit too much in the end. The waitress brought over some bread that was both crusty and soft in the right places, although a shame that they appear to charge for this (albeit less than two euros). The rib-eye was cooked medium-rare, as requested and was the best I have had in a long while... full of flavour and well seasoned. Alas the sizeable portion of fries was also well seasoned and eaten together there was too much salt going on.

The evening was accompanied by the excellent ibrahim who made us feel very welcome. He described dishes before we ordered which was great. The other waiting staff were equally excellent throughout and spoke excellent english.  We had three courses all of which were superbly presented and tasty. The lamb was incredible. As was the fruit dessert.  Small plates of other bits and bobs were brought to us at different stages aswell as a shot of a celery mojito to start and a couple of shots of a local liqueur to end. All in all a wonderful meal and superb value with 3 courses each and a bottle of veuve cliquet (birthday treat) coming to just over ‚Ç¨100.

The only negative is that things just felt a little rushed. Our waiter was keen to take our order seemingly 5 minutes after we'd sat down. We had to decline again a few minutes later. We shared a salad as a starter which was very nice but before we'd finished it our steaks had arrived and the remains of the salad had to go to make way for the mains. I can't recall ever having my food taken away from me before I'd finished. This was a Saturday night and the restaurant was quite busy but not full - although we noticed both tables either side of us turned over whilst we were there with new diners.

First of all, it comes in what looks something like a large Martini glass. Right there I was thinking, ok, here we go again, why can't restaurants leave the cheesecake alone.

I wish we had found it before our last night in Madrid. While we have had some really good meals in Madrid, we would have substituted most of them for Metro Bistro Although we had read that it was hard to get into, because it was summer, not only did we get a reservation but there were plenty of seats all evening. First of all, the service was fantastic. Friendly, welcoming and seemed they were glad we were there. We had been a little concerned that most of the reviews talked more about the waiter Ibrahim and we thought maybe all the reviews were done by his family. Well, he was on vacation and the service was still great and we aren't members of his family pushing the restaurant. While not inexpensive, the portions are large and delicious. We were given a small cucumber mojito when we arrived. We split an appetizer of sliced veal that gives Iberico a run for it's money. We also split the slow roasted, low temperature lamb that was amazing. We finished with the chocolate dessert that was four different chocolate treats. They followed up with candy treats and limoncello. This is not your typical tapas restaurant so be prepared for a more leisurely meal with cloth napkins and tablecloths.

My girlfriend and I visited this restaurant last night and we had such a fantastic experience I felt compelled to sign up to tripadvisor to share it with everyone else.  I will separate the review into key areas: The Welcome: A warm and friendly greeting from the floor staff working that evening. We had no reservation which wasn't a problem and we were allowed to choose a table. The building is well decorated and modern providing a elegant atmosphere.  The Service: Exceptional care and time was given to us. Being the naive British tourists that we are, our Spanish is less than satisfactory. This was no problem for the staff who attempted to the best of their ability to translate and answer the many questions that we had. The food arrived promptly and we were given all kinds of complementary bits and pieces (explained in the food section). The Wine: The wine list is extraordinary! A few pages of whites and roses and an even bigger section of reds. These range from around Spain, France and the rest of the world. I chose an Argentinian Malbec for ‚Ç¨21.50 which is an average price on the menu, this was lovely. The large variety also comes with prices ranging from ‚Ç¨14 right up to ‚Ç¨260. You will definitely find a wine that you like on this menu.  The Food: The best part of the evening. The menu boasts a selection of starters including four options for vegetarians. There are around 7 main course options which include a variety of meat and fish. There is also the option to enjoy a 7 course tasting menu for ‚Ç¨38 per head. My girlfriend and I chose to order from the menu rather than try the tasting menu. Despite this we were given a stylish drink on arrival which we are still not sure what exactly it was but tasted amazing! Following this we were provided with a variety of breads consisting of normal white, spiced Peruvian and a subtle chocolate and orange version and all accompanied with olive and sage butters. Our starters of fois gras then arrived which was elegantly presented on a thin white plate with stylish and tasty decoration and was absolutely incredible. For our main course we chose the bacon and veal hamburger with fried yacca, caramelised onions and melted Camembert. If you have a big greasy burger pictured in your head then remove that image now! It was the best burger I've ever had. It consisted of two burgers of a veal and bacon blend. Between these was the fried yacca and the melted Camembert. They have chosen not to include a bun with the burger which is a fantastic idea and really adds to the flavour and presentation. For dessert I chose the caramelised pineapple filled with half frozen yoghurt and mango sorbet which was refreshing and light.  We were then provided with complementary sugar coated jellies one, amaretto and the other passion fruit.  The chef is nothing short of a genius with what they have done with the menu. The presentation and flavours were sublime, that can easily be compared to Michelin star standards. The price of all this luxury ‚Ç¨78, and I walked out of there feeling like I had robbed them.  I couldn't urge you enough to visit Metro Bistro if you are ever in Madrid.  Thanks for a wonderful evening!

I would recommend booking a day or two in advance as the restaurant gets extremely busy after 8pm with a queue that goes right out of the door (especially on weekends).  Our hotel kindly booked a slot for us at 8:30pm however upon arrival the staff seemed to be a tad confused as the booking was under the hotels name and not ours. After a little back and forth of them telling us to come back at 11pm as we didn‚Äôt have a booking, eventually they found our reservation and we were seated... so the service at first impression wasn‚Äôt great.  We asked for a recommendation on how many tapas dishes to select and the waitress recommended 3-4 if we were very hungry, so that‚Äôs what we went with. We decided upon a mixture of the eggplant, chicken, boar and croquettes. All of which were amazing but especially the eggplant (the sauce that came with it was the best of the night). The dishes were also generous size portions and left us complete full! (They also provide all tables with complimentary bottled water and bread to go with the meals). To top off what was a great meal, the cocktails they provide are amazing. I had a few strawberry daiquiris and they are made quick and fresh straight to your table. If the restaurant/bar wasn‚Äôt so packed after our meal I would of definitely stayed just to have some more drinks. They worked out ‚Ç¨7.50 each which is great considering back home they would be around ¬£10 each.  I really wish I could rate this restaurant 5/5 however the service we received at the beginning was quite hostile and no dishes were brought to our table with a smile.

He loved it. Rosi La Loca puts a modern spin on traditional Spanish dishes.  For COVID measures, they took our temperatures and contact information (for contact tracing) at the door and gave us hand sanitizer. There was a plastic barrier between all of the tables, and staff brought cutlery in plastic packaging, which they removed from the table immediately. The plastic packaging feels wasteful, but I understand the goal is to protect customers.  Cristina and Ismail were extremely attentive. Ismail speaks perfect English, and all of the staff quickly scanned our table for empty glasses/plates every time they passed.  I recommend Rosi La Loca to anyone visiting Madrid.

There's an upstairs and downstairs so the restaurant is bigger than you would think. I would not recommend sitting outside, the alleyway is not nice. The sangria was great, loaded with fruit. The food comes very quick so don't order everything in one go else you'll have a table loaded with food. There are limited options for a vegetarian but we still managed. We started with the eggplant chips (really delicious) and the burrata salad (also delicious). The next two dishes were not my favorite - we ordered the smoky octopus, it was the whole octopus (not just the legs) and although well cooked I was turned off by parts of it - a bit gooey and chewy. The tuna tartar was also not to my taste, it was quite spicy and the red sauce took away from the natural tuna flavor. The desert was probably our best part of the meal - the tiramisu served in a coffee pot. It was really delicious, quite rich so one to share was perfect.

From the opening celery mohito drink to the amazing homage to chocolate, every serving was a new adventure.

Service was friendly and cordial. The sangria was good and we then had a dessert.

So much so that we decided to cancel a reservation elsewhere and return another evening. Unfortunately on this occasion things were not quite so good. One of our party chose the chicken dish which was on the front ‚Äòspecials‚Äô page. He had virtually finished with just about a quarter of the chicken left when he found it was completely frozen. We were all flabbergasted as had never seen this before. The majority had appeared to be cooked ok but the last bit completely frozen. The staff were good and took the price of this dish off our bill and offered us a dessert but none of us could face eating anything else. So we paid and left and kept our fingers crossed that none of us went down with food poisoning.

The friend was right for the most part, the food was incredible. We ordered a variety to cater for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. As much as we loved the food, the service (one particular employee in particular) reallyyyy tainted our experience. We arrived and immediately notified the host that although just two of us had arrived, we would eventually have 5 in 15 minutes and were happy to wait at the bar or a smaller table in the meantime. Although most of the staff was fairly friendly, the man we told this to could not have been more unfriendly and grumpy. He rolled his eyes, told us there was only so much he can do (to which we replied it would be understandable if we had to wait a beat when they arrived). Meanwhile, a couple that was sitting at a five person table graciously offered to swap tables with our two person one. He managed to enthusiastically butter them up and refuse to allow the switch. It was so uncomfortable that another waiter went as far as to say not to listen to his colleague as he was rude and not helpful. To top it off, he ended up being our waiter upstairs. Although he actually was quite helpful with food recommendations and portions, he continued to be rude by being snarky and correcting our attempt to be polite by speaking in Spanish. He ridiculed the fact that we accidentally said copa instead of vaso and mocked our mistake by bringing us a wine glass. I‚Äôm so torn about coming back. This was by far the rudest server we have encountered during our two weeks, but the food was indeed quite good. Be warned- the upstairs feels like an overflow/party room and the atmosphere pales in comparison to below. I‚Äôm not one to write reviews but cannot help but give a heads up.",2019-11-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3688138-Reviews-or40-El_miniBAR-Madrid.html,UID_3816,0.085,0.835,0.08,0.3605,0.2131364468864469,0.5929761904761903,0.5375294117647059,1859,169,0.0909090909090909,0,33,False,71,0.1392405063291139,0.1518987341772152,0.2278481012658227,0.050632911392405,0.189873417721519,0.0253164556962025,0.0253164556962025,0.0253164556962025,0.1265822784810126,0.0379746835443038,340,208,4.470588235294118,0,0,minibar came highli recommend friend live madrid sometim excit told go wrong friend right part food incred order varieti cater vegetarian meat eater alik much love food servic one particular employe particular reallyyyy taint experi arriv immedi notifi host although two us arriv would eventu minut happi wait bar smaller tabl meantim although staff fairli friendli man told could unfriendli grumpi roll eye told us much repli would understand wait beat arriv meanwhil coupl sit five person tabl gracious offer swap tabl two person one manag enthusiast butter refus allow switch uncomfort anoth waiter went far say listen colleagu rude help top end waiter upstair although actual quit help food recommend portion continu rude snarki correct attempt polit speak spanish ridicul fact accident said copa instead vaso mock mistak bring us wine glass torn come back far rudest server encount two week food inde quit good warn upstair feel like overflow parti room atmospher pale comparison one write review cannot help give head,bad review,2

We found this gem after walking in the rain for hours. We had the boar roll (our favorite), aubergines wrapped in bacon with tomato orange sauce, panko chicken strips, Manchego cheese cured with black truffles (absolutely delicious) with wine, beers and excellent service. I read review from an American saying that he had the aubergine with bacon and that it was delicious although it was not bacon. Well, certainly not streaky American bacon. If he travels and try all the world bacons, he would learn that American bacon is not the ‚Äúonly‚Äù bacon. Take for example the English bacon! Full of meat. Take the Eastern Europe bacon, extra thick and chunky, take the Italian pancetta. What I am trying to say is that North Americans aka USA people think their food products are the one and only ones in the world! So beware of reviews from some kind of people.
