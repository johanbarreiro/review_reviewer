Two days later we stopped for a quick snack had a plate of Jamon Iberico again and a plate of Mushrooms washed down with a 1981 Berberana Reserva 50 Euros that was even better than the Muga. The service was excellent and the owner David Villalon was an expert on Spanish wine. His description of the wines and the enthusiasm he displayed about the wines he sold was exceptional.

And they also have a very interesting and impressive set of natural wines too - wines made with natural yeast and fermentation and the minimum of sulphites.  If you have never tried them this is a good place to begin. Davide and his team know their stuff and are happy to share their knowledge and enthusiasm. Accompanying the wine are small plates to share. Every one we had from pepper salad with smoked sardine, via mushrooms to a tartare and sashimi was perfectly judged and presented.

Florin explained with details but not boring the restaurant concept and the appetizers and we were really glad with his suggestions: cecina, croquetas and the butters that came with the artesenal breads were delicious. For entrees, we had the Steak Tartare (one of the best that I tried), Sirloin Steak and our daughter asked for the Beaf-Bacon Burger. Before they brough the main dishes, Chef Matias came to the table and explained the cooking process of each plate. I thought that it was because the restaurant was still almost empty, but as it was filling up quickly, I saw him going table by table doing the same thing which is really appreciated. For desserts we had Tat-crumble and the Pineapple Cannelloni with more Mojito, a Chupito and beautiful and tasty Cappuccino for the teenager.

This was no problem as there was more than enough space and we were shown to a table. The setting was modern and in a clean style, we liked it and thought of it as very fitting. Service was very friendly, attentive and discreet. The food was brought by one of the chefs, who impressed with great presenting skills and profound knowledge. For food, we chose various starters to share, all fantastic and in generous portions. The foie-gras stood out for us. As mains, we had the black risotto with scallop and the Segovian piglet. Both dishes were brilliant, the Segovian piglet however was a highlight of the entire trip. For desert we shared a desert and went for the tribute to chocolate which was implemented perfectly.

And what a find it was! I came in early for local times - 8:15 pm - and so was able to secure a table without a reservation. If you’re coming in at local times, say 10 pm, you’d better reserve. They kindly advised me that the kitchen didn’t open before 8:30 pm which was fine since I could enjoy one of the many wines they have by the glass. And this is the only reason why you would call this place a wine bar, the wine selection, because the food is top quality restaurant food but with the possibility to serve either full size or half portions. And they even tell you if it’s better to go for a half as a starter (which was my case). I was well taken care off by David whom I believe is the sommelier, but without pretention. He advised me throughout on wines to match with the food I ordered and I discovered some wines I otherwise would have never tasted, the first one being à German Riesling! The artichoke, shiitake, beef sauce and gambas starter was superb and the 2 month dry aged entrecôte was to die for. Excellent service, food and wine, what more could one ask for?

We also liked the cool minimalist decor and overall ambience.  The dinner started off great. Nice olives, lovely wine, smooth vermouth on ice, and affable waiter. But then it went downhill.  We ordered the special ""tacos"" and hake. There was some miscommunication over what was in the tacos. The waiter described it as salmon but it turned out to be pigs ears. This is a significant difference. Had we been into pig's ears (chewy and fatty) I'm sure we would have appreciated them but that is not what we thought we were getting into. Out for a fun time, we were in great spirits and found the situation funny! A surly waiter who we explained everything to had zero sense of humor or empathy and simply removed them from our table.  Next came the hake, which was described as in a seafood broth with a seaweed (I think) foam and some sort of aioli. Mmm we were excited. The dish, however, was trying way too hard. Although very artful it was a molecular gastronomic disappointment. The seafood ""broth"" was more of a gooey paste at odds with dabs of an angry chipotle sauce and yellow boring mayonnaise; the thin foam had as much flavor as a glass of aqua con gas; worse, the ""foam"" was dampening in a few minutes what was probably once crispy fish skin; the fish underneath was slightly undercooked and bland. A few dense fingerling potatoes rolled around on the plate in a blind quest for some salt. The dish was also lukewarm. It was a fail.  Needless to say we did not finish the dish. Surly waiter came back, asked us how it was, and we tried hard to be nice. He was not pleased. Neither were we!!! We passed on dessert. The check returned, inclusive of the unfinished pigs ears.  We are from New York City and we are not gastronomic neophytes. Plus, we travel a ton. We know what's going on in the food world (btw, foams are so five years ago!). Aside from the lackluster food, what really got us was how rude the waiter was. He knew we were unhappy, and with a few simple gestures he could have easily turned it around. It was just so crappy. So much of Spain and Madrid have fantastic food experiences and this was not one of them. What a waste of a night out.",2018-02-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10159455-Reviews-or80-Angelita_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_2014,0.096,0.789,0.115,0.6737,0.0595468456464918,0.5483487162732447,0.3679441176470588,2314,212,0.0916162489196197,5,71,False,70,0.1046511627906976,0.127906976744186,0.2441860465116279,0.0465116279069767,0.0930232558139534,0.0348837209302325,0.0813953488372093,0.0232558139534883,0.1744186046511628,0.0697674418604651,430,264,4.372093023255814,0,0,husband came late night dinner excit visit hear one top rate restaur madrid also like cool minimalist decor overal ambienc dinner start great nice oliv love wine smooth vermouth ice affabl waiter went downhil order special taco hake miscommun taco waiter describ salmon turn pig ear signific differ pig ear chewi fatti sure would appreci thought get fun time great spirit found situat funni surli waiter explain everyth zero sens humor empathi simpli remov tabl next came hake describ seafood broth seawe think foam sort aioli mmm excit dish howev tri way hard although art molecular gastronom disappoint seafood broth gooey past odd dab angri chipotl sauc yellow bore mayonnais thin foam much flavor glass aqua con ga wors foam dampen minut probabl crispi fish skin fish underneath slightli undercook bland dens fingerl potato roll around plate blind quest salt dish also lukewarm fail needless say finish dish surli waiter came back ask us tri hard nice pleas neither pass dessert check return inclus unfinish pig ear new york citi gastronom neophyt plu travel ton know go food world btw foam five year ago asid lacklust food realli got us rude waiter knew unhappi simpl gestur could easili turn around crappi much spain madrid fantast food experi one wast night,very good,5

I went here on a recommendation from a client on one of our tours. I liked the name - vaguely meaning cacophony in the Moorish tongue - and the idea that it was a family run Riojan bar. I. Love. La. Rioja. So I took my friend and his partner there for a birthday lunch.  We stayed for about an hour and a half or more. The lady running, and I'm disappointed I've forgotten her name - lots of good wine, which by the way is unique to their bar and comes from David Moreno's estate - was a chirpy and bolshy Riojan lady who talked to us, joked with us, and made us feel like we were in her home. Her sister, who came out a little later from the kitchen, was equally as pleasant and passionate about the food they were serving.  The food then: we were served some creative free little tapas first and then moved on to the ordered food. Delightful sticks of asparagus wrapped in a crunchy coating served with a mojo picon sauce. Delicious and light. Then the best croquetas I have ever had. Small yes, but so creamy and made with red shrimp. Then I opted for the chumarro - a whole sliced and perfectly grilled pork loin - served with caramelised onions. Light and fragrant and meaty. Perfectly cooked.  The desserts were nice enough, a sort of toffee thing on an apple thing and a decadent dark chocolate slice. I can't remember to be honest. I was having too much of a good time by that point. Price. A little high, not crazy, for the portion size. But the quality spoke for itself.  This is not a place for a casual lunch. This is something a little nicer, a little more special. A place for a romantic dinner or a celebration or a time when you fancy something with a touch of class.  Really very good indeed.",2015-10-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991733-Reviews-or210-Restaurante_Algarabia-Madrid.html,UID_2023,0.009,0.791,0.2,0.9968,0.2884438775510204,0.6402721088435375,0.3272142857142857,1742,156,0.0895522388059701,0,51,False,59,0.1368421052631579,0.1789473684210526,0.2421052631578947,0.0842105263157894,0.1473684210526315,0.0421052631578947,0.031578947368421,0.031578947368421,0.0526315789473684,0.0526315789473684,332,207,4.234939759036145,0,0,well oh pleasant went recommend client one tour like name vagu mean cacophoni moorish tongu idea famili run riojan bar love la rioja took friend partner birthday lunch stay hour half ladi run disappoint forgotten name lot good wine way uniqu bar come david moreno estat chirpi bolshi riojan ladi talk us joke us made us feel like home sister came littl later kitchen equal pleasant passion food serv food serv creativ free littl tapa first move order food delight stick asparagu wrap crunchi coat serv mojo picon sauc delici light best croqueta ever small ye creami made red shrimp opt chumarro whole slice perfectli grill pork loin serv caramelis onion light fragrant meati perfectli cook dessert nice enough sort toffe thing appl thing decad dark chocol slice rememb honest much good time point price littl high crazi portion size qualiti spoke place casual lunch someth littl nicer littl special place romant dinner celebr time fanci someth touch class realli good inde,very good,5

Initial impressions were great, nice interior and able to watch them cooking the steak from the window, unfortunately that is where it ended for me. My wife and I both ordered the filet steak cooked medium, mine was almost blue at one end and medium rare for the rest, I can manage medium rare and had eaten most of the steak before getting to the undercooked part, my wife's was exactly the same. The meat tastes nice and the baked potatoes were lovely. We were not asked at any point during our meal how the food was which is in my opinion very unusual and even more so we were disappointed not to be offered desert and when we eventually asked for the bill the waitress walked over and pretty much dumped it on the table, again not asking if we had enjoyed our visit.

Third time yesterday nigh, a waiter complained to one of my 4 guests that the table we were seating it was not booked for us (after we already took our order and we were drinking our wine) and despite the ""manager"" (who claimed later to be ""part of the family"") invited us to use that place there!...

Run by three brothers, each with a specialty (wine, food or cocktails), the quality of the food and especially the fresh produce, stands out. Tomatoes from the family garden, carefully prepared with olive oil, herbs and small bits of salty sardine (if you like), were fantastic. Roast pork shoulder was amazing. And the wines really set Angelita apart. With a selection of un-sulfured wines and old vintages from around Spain and a few other countries, the ability to try a range of styles and ages by the glass is quite special. Wonderful ambience, with high ceilings and tall windows make it a welcoming, calm, happy space. Oh, and there's a hip bar downstairs with music and cocktails into the late hours (well, until 2am, when the clubs get going or your pillow calls you).",2017-07-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10159455-Reviews-or110-Angelita_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_2047,0.0,0.774,0.226,0.9907,0.1996583850931677,0.6233229813664595,0.4602,946,62,0.0655391120507399,0,32,False,34,0.0975609756097561,0.1951219512195122,0.3658536585365853,0.0,0.1951219512195122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975609756097561,0.048780487804878,163,123,4.809815950920245,0,0,small pretti restaur far gran via hortaleza amaz food ton modern wine glass plu mani bottl includ old vintag run three brother specialti wine food cocktail qualiti food especi fresh produc stand tomato famili garden care prepar oliv oil herb small bit salti sardin like fantast roast pork shoulder amaz wine realli set angelita apart select un sulfur wine old vintag around spain countri abil tri rang style age glass quit special wonder ambienc high ceil tall window make welcom calm happi space oh hip bar downstair music cocktail late hour well club get go pillow call,very good,5

But this is to do Pilar's cooking a disservice: she brings a creative touch to everything she makes, drawing freely on other Spanish culinary traditions (the Catalan romesco sauce with the divine batter-fried asparagus spears) and on her own inventiveness (a rice pudding that's almost mousse-like in its lightness because she puts the the grains of rice through a grinder--ask Isabel to tell you the story of why Pilar came up with that twist).

I went to this place based on the rating and number of reviews here (but did not actually read any of them). The homely setting, the lovely and personal service by the sisters duo, the good, home cooked food and the house wine from Rioja (which is the region from where the sisters are) - all was a great, unforgettable experience.  I got the Oxtail stew - tasty, well cooked fall-off-the-bone meat and hearty. I also got the complimentary pate to begin with - that was yummy too - warm and tasty. The house wine was very good - medium bodied and smooth. I ended with a complimentary glass of harvest(?) wine from Rioja.

We walked from our apartment on a very cold but clear night, past the resplendant Royal Palace and Teatro Real, both virtually at the restaurant's doorstep. As we stepped inside the always stylish and beautiful Isabel welcomed us with a warm embrace and a kiss on both cheeks reminding us why we were so looking forward to our return visit..Isabel even remembered to seat us at the same table for two by the window! Pilar, busy working her magic in kitchen, stuck her head out and blew us a kiss as we settled in for another wonderful evening in Rioja. Many of our favorites were still on the menu such as Pilar's signature Rabo de Toro and the exquisite Trigueros Crujientes, along with new dishes such as the Salad with Boar Sausage and the Rabbit Ragout, a marvelously light and succulent take on Ragout a la Bolognese. Algarabia's David Moreno Rioja is smooth and elegant and pairs wonderfully with the Rioja cuisine. The mood is quiet and ever so romantic. The restaurant's setting in the parlor of an old Madrileño house exudes warmth and elegance, a perfect combination of mood, Rioja and great food. Later (much later, this is Madrid) Pilar joined us for a glass of wine at our table and we chatted like old friends before enjoying dessert and 'chupitos' of their wonderful herb Aguardiente. Algarabia remains our favorite restaurant not just in Madrid but in all of Spain. When in Madrid, come to Algarabia and let Pilar and Isabel take you on a delicious journey to Rioja ...

There are very few Italian restaurants in the city and I consider none of them have managed to make a decent Pizza. I finally found the place for Pizzas in Madrid and that is La Pizzateca. Perfect combination: great product cooked with passion and well as great service. It reminds me of dining in New York city, you get the best Pizzas and the best service. You pay according to the product you are having, 10 to 11 Euros for the great Pizza in Madrid. My wife had the lazagna which she considered superb, tiramisu was also great, good selection of exotic beers, and again the best Pizza I have had in years.

This place popped up and had great reviews. And I can’t fault it. We went twice during our 3 night stay in Madrid. The first visit we spoke English (we’re Australian) and the staff member (a very polite young man) attending to us had excellent English. While ordering he made recommendations which personally, I love when they do this. (For eg. He suggested I order a bread basket with my meal as it was quite saucy, the bread is good to eat with the sauce once you finish the pasta) he was on point with his recommendations haha and he was extremely friendly and professional the whole time. The atmosphere was friendly and casual, the place itself was modern. The second time we went we spoke in Spanish, the woman serving us was just as polite, the restaurant was a bit busier than the previous visit but the service was still spot on, the meals came out in good time, when we switched to English half way through, so did the young lady without skipping a beat. Our food both visits was delicious, we were completely satisfied by the whole experience both times and I’d highly recommend. (Ps sorry the photos are rubbish lol).

Got to the restaurant and there was a wait, I told the hostess(who is also a server) that I wanted to be added to the list. She informed me there would be a 20 minute wait. I asked if I could sit at the bar she said yes! She didn’t give me a menu or anything. The restaurant for its size wasn’t staffed appropriately. One bartender, 3 servers and no hostess. I sat at the bar watching the bartender sweat while making drinks, this is the first restaurant I’ve been to in Madrid where the wait staff look like they hate their jobs. Finally after waiting at the bar without an acknowledgement or a menu, the bartender asked if I needed something. And I replied with yes I’d like to order food and drinks but I don’t have a menu. He brought one over and blamed the waitress for not letting him know. I made it very easy and asked for a Tinto de verano as my drink. For food I asked what the cheeseless options were and I took his recommendations. I specifically asked for items without cheese. I watched him make my drinks with 90% Fanta and a splash of wine. It was terrible, I didn’t finish it. My pizza came out fine but he ordered me a dish that was covered in cheese. It wasn’t until I sent that back that the wait staff started to be nice to me. I hadn’t eaten all day and you would expect this to be the most amazing pizza ever. It wasn’t. I even heard other tables complain/comment “this better be the best pizza I’ve ever had.” At the bar I asked the bartender if I could pay he heard me but ignored my request since he was so slammed. It wasn’t until I got out of my seat that he went and got the terminal to charge my card. The whole experience was complete and utter garbage. Never again.

Neither of us had ever been before but after seeing the reviews online we decided to give it a go.  Our reservation was for 8pm and when we arrived the place was relatively quiet, which soon changed as people started arriving for their evening meal. I ordered the beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce and my partner had the 500g ribeye.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, after hearing they tended to come slightly rare we opted for medium which was cooked beautifully, you could practically cut them with your spoon . There was no fat or gristle just soft, brilliantly seasoned meat and the fries (I had the garlic and parsley ones) went fantastically. Paired with a glass of red wine I can honestly say it was the best meal I've ever had.  The staff were excellent and switched between Spanish and English with no hesitation and the whole place had a relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere.

It was close to the hotel, had great reviews, and we wanted a break from all of the jamon and tapas we'd been eating in Spain. We absolutely loved it. We ordered the la diavola, a glass of wine, and a small beer. The pizza was so good that we ate the lightly crispy yet slightly chewy crust with no sauce. Anyone who's eaten pizza knows that good crust is not easy to find. Even at good pizzerias you'll see bits of crust left on the table. But here our pizza was perfectly cooked and we ate every last bit of it. In fact, we loved the food there so much that we came back 2 nights later!

The staff were lovely and it wasn’t too busy when we arrived around 7.30pm. We didn’t need to book but it did get busy later on in the evening.  Wine was very reasonably priced €3.00 for a glass! However, spirits were much more expensive. This is probably more common for the area though!  The menu has a great selection. We opted for the argentine sausage which was delicious and the provolone cheese (we had this just to try but really didn’t enjoy it as it was quite oily).  For mains we both had the ribeye steak which was cooked perfectly and so tasty.  The only downsides to this restaurant is that there is no steak sauces on the menu so I’m not sure if they have any. You also have to order all your sides separately. So €23 only gets you the steak, there’s more cost for sides and there’s not a great selection. I would have really appreciated a side salad along with the steak but all you get is 3 cherry tomatoes. Overall a lovely restaurant in a great location from our hotel.

The food was excellent and the staff were very friendly and spoke good English. A thing to note beyond the Spanish eating lunch and dinner later than most of us are used to doing is that restaurants that close after lunch and re-open at dinner don't really open early or even right on time. If they open at 7:00, you should expect on going around 7:10-7:15. We went at 7:00 and visited a couple tourist shops on the street (very eclectic shops on this street) and around 7:15 went to eat and were the first to walk in. We had a serving of the fried mozzarella and it was fabulous (although not healthy at all I imagine) and a couple pizzas. It was excellent pizza and better than any pizza I've had in Europe outside of Italy. Fair prices and, as I mentioned, friendly and attentive staff.

Looking at the map, we found this place and got the Napoletana (anchovies, black olives, cheese, tomatoes, oregano). It was terrific, probably better than any other pizza we have had in terms of pure flavor, including those we've had in various spots all over Italy. The crust is a tad thicker and less wet than Italian pizza, and the toppings were of the perfect amount--not too much like in the US and not as minimalistic as in some Italian places.

Yes it does sell good quality takeaway pizza but past the counter you can also find a delightful, bright, small restaurant area. In the restaurant you can choose the pizza on show in the shop and there is also an extensive separate menu mainly featuring pizza but with a few other choices.  The reason to go here is the excellent quality of the pizza. We cannot ever remember such a light and crispy crust, and from the restaurant you can partly see the kitchen where everything is clearly prepared with great care and attention resulting in a delicious meal. Wine also decent and good value.  We ate here 3 nights during a 6 night stay in Madrid.

First off: the service and decor were lovely. The food was really well prepared, but flavors seemed a bit of one note. The menu looked really interesting - we tried a tomato salad, pig ear and sea bass. They sent a complimentary salmon tartare that was over the top. If i could have ordered that as an app, i would have. It had salt and JALEPENO!!!! I realized i had been missing heat in my food and this was spectacular. The flavors were balanced, and well contrasted, yum. So, my expectations were high - the tomato salad - eh. Nice tomatoes, needed something else in flavor contrast. The pigs ear weren't my thing - but i tried them. They were supposed to have a spicy sauce - Crispy, but again, the flavor seemed one note and not spicy. Sea bass was cooked perfectly, but again, no contrast. I really wanted an acid (lemon/vinegar) or an element of surprise.  Maybe we didn't order the right items to show the talent of this place.

It´s an unassuming place located within a 10 minute walk from the Center of Madrid. It sits 5 to 6 people so it´s best to get your pizza to go and eat outside now that the weather is nice.  You can either get a whole pie made for you (have to wait 15 minutes or so) or eat one of their pre-made slices that they will graciously heat in the pizza oven. We went for the 2 slices + beverage combo each and we ended up with quite a lot of pizza to eat. The crust was thick, crunchy and had a great hand made flavor. They had quite a variety of flavors so we got one of each: arugula, goat cheese and balsamic pizza, 5 cheese pizza, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, sweet onions and bacon... They were all delicious and the price was unbeatable. 6 slices (each slice is split in halves so you end up with 12 small portions) + 3 bevarages: 20 Euros. My girlfriend complained that we had to wait a bit for the pizzas to heat but it wasn´t an issue for me.  If you are craving a slice of pizza do yourself a favor and drag your behind to this place, it will be worth it.",2015-04-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2086638-Reviews-or220-La_Pizzateca-Madrid.html,UID_2294,0.017,0.898,0.085,0.9272,0.2,0.4425595238095238,0.42841,1144,107,0.0935314685314685,0,28,False,52,0.1379310344827586,0.1034482758620689,0.3793103448275862,0.0689655172413793,0.0689655172413793,0.0344827586206896,0.0344827586206896,0.0,0.1724137931034483,0.0,230,150,3.969565217391304,0,0,read rave review knew go pizza la pizzateca unassum place locat within minut walk center madrid sit peopl best get pizza go eat outsid weather nice either get whole pie made wait minut eat one pre made slice gracious heat pizza oven went slice beverag combo end quit lot pizza eat crust thick crunchi great hand made flavor quit varieti flavor got one arugula goat chees balsam pizza chees pizza mushroom truffl oil pizza sweet onion bacon delici price unbeat slice slice split halv end small portion bevarag euro girlfriend complain wait bit pizza heat issu crave slice pizza favor drag behind place worth,very good,5

But then you don't mind paying more if the meal is truly special. A meal at Angelita is just this! Visiting Madrid a couple of weeks ago with my husband and father in law, we tried our luck to get a table on a Friday night. The restaurant was fully booked, but they had space at the bar. We ordered several dishes to share, as well as wine to accompany. The food - incredible. The vegetable dishes were incredibly tasty and the meat dishes cooked to perfection. The presentation of the food was very photo worthy! The wine list is extensive and the staff are readily available to suggest what might go well with your dishes. We opted for the cheese board for desert - what a lovely experience! We were invited to the cheese trolley where one of the team talked through each and every cheese, helping us to pick a selection. One of the ladies at the bar then helped us pick a desert wine to match. The staff/team who work at this restaurant are simply brilliant. Attention to detail, knowledge of dishes, wine etc really impressive. We had a throughly enjoyable evening, not just because the food was simply delicious, but because the whole atmosphere and experience at Angelita meant that for days afterwards we were talking about how much we had enjoyed it.

The staff are really friendly and welcoming and provide English menus if required. The menu itself is divided into 5 veggie, 5 meat, 5 fish dishes and 5 desserts, and you can either order full portions, half portions or tapas portions. This is a great idea, as it makes it possible to enjoy many of the delights on offer, regardless of how hungry you are, and the waitress was happy to advise us on how much food we should order. Every dish that came was simply delicious, and I was surprised (not to mention slightly disappointed!) that 'half portions' would fill me up so much that I wouldn't be able to fit in my favourite part of any meal - the dessert! The final bill came to less than €26 between two of us - amazing value!!

The fact that it is, literally, right next door to where we are staying only cemented this plan. We were greeted in an extremely friendly way and that feeling continued during our entire visit. The food was original and delicious. The vegetable tempura was light and delicious. The tuna tartare was flavorful and the accompanying avocado ice cream was amazing. Every dish we had was outstanding and I would love to go back and try many more. My 12-year-old and I both loved it. His favorite was the tempura and his dessert of cinnamon ice cream. I loved the stuffed tomato, avocado ice cream, tuna tartare and the crusty fresh bread. My only disappointment was the tinto which was too light for me.

So my first recommendation...","I went to this tapas bar thanks to Tripadvisor for a dinner on saturday night.  Luckily we arrived around 8.30 pm when the restaurant was about to open, because after 9.30 pm it got really crowd and every table was occupied. So my first recommendation here is that if you are a group of people, it's better to get the reservation right away or just arrive early.  Located in a quiet street with nothing nearby, it seemed like the place is well known by the locals. It looks normal, nothing pretentious. But it is really at its best! However, the staffs were very friendly and attentive. They attended us with smiley face and very calm, unlike other typical spanish bar. They provide a menu in english and spanish (all the dishes and drinks). So if you don't speak spanish, it won't be a problem to order. Taberna Origen offers a selection of dishes, dividing into three sections: from the sea, the vegetable, and the earth. So the variety is limited, but trust me… regardless the number of dishes offered, they are all beautifully presented and from my own experience (I have tried 5)… all are well cooked and designed. The quality prevails over the quantity! Another good thing of this place is that they let you choose the size: full portion, half portion and tapas portion with different prices. This allows you to try different dishes. We were two and we ordered 5 of half-portion dishes and a dessert. A bit way too much.  We tried out:  - Cuttlefish burger with alioli of yuzu and arugula (6.5 euros) - for half portion and it came with 2 burgers, perfect for us, since we were 2!. The cuttlefish burger was great. The alioli blew me away.  - Meat mini burgers- the meat was perfectly cooked (6.5 euros), regardless it is very normal dishes, they are able to make it different!; - Rabo de toro (ox tail) - very tender and tasty (7.00 euros);  - Tartare of tuna with avocado ice-cream - the touch of sesame oil makes it to the top of my list. What a great combination of flavours! (9.00 euros); - Iberian cheeks with yucca chips - the sauce was great. The cheek was very soft and absorbed all the sauce. Yucca chips were a great idea to combine with the cheek (7.00 euros).  For the dessert: we were actually very full but my friend was like to try so we shared chocolate coulant with violet ice-cream (4.5 euros) - the coulant was light but very chocolatey. However, it is not cloying which is ideal! Violet ice-cream was creamy, rich in violet but not so sweet, so it adds a little freshness to the dish. I was full but I enjoyed it until my very last bite! The drinks were at reasonable price. I ordered a glass of Cava (3 euros) and two bottle of water (1.5 euro each). We ended up paying 46.50 euros for two and were about to explode by the time we leave. I would say that if you order reasonably, it should cost roughly 15-20 euros per person. :D During lunch time they do offer 2 tapas-size dishes (anything from the menu) with a dessert or coffee and a glass beer/ house wine for 7.95 euros. This is a hidden gem in Madrid. It's not so far from the city centre and it is walkable from Princesa Shopping Street and Plaza de España. So if you wanna try a modern spanish tapas with a lot of idea and love in it, you can't miss this place. I have had a great time there and definitely will go back!",2015-03-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6613386-Reviews-or200-Origen_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_2350,0.011,0.806,0.183,0.9991,0.2919257703081233,0.518704481792717,0.4132394736842105,3307,280,0.084668884185062,8,128,False,148,0.131578947368421,0.131578947368421,0.3026315789473684,0.0526315789473684,0.1447368421052631,0.0263157894736842,0.0,0.0394736842105263,0.0921052631578947,0.0789473684210526,614,344,4.3762214983713354,0,0,went tapa bar thank tripadvisor dinner saturday night luckili arriv around pm restaur open pm got realli crowd everi tabl occupi first recommend group peopl better get reserv right away arriv earli locat quiet street noth nearbi seem like place well known local look normal noth pretenti realli best howev staff friendli attent attend us smiley face calm unlik typic spanish bar provid menu english spanish dish drink speak spanish problem order taberna origen offer select dish divid three section sea veget earth varieti limit trust regardless number dish offer beauti present experi tri well cook design qualiti prevail quantiti anoth good thing place let choos size full portion half portion tapa portion differ price allow tri differ dish two order half portion dish dessert bit way much tri cuttlefish burger alioli yuzu arugula euro half portion came burger perfect us sinc cuttlefish burger great alioli blew away meat mini burger meat perfectli cook euro regardless normal dish abl make differ rabo de toro ox tail tender tasti euro tartar tuna avocado ice cream touch sesam oil make top list great combin flavour euro iberian cheek yucca chip sauc great cheek soft absorb sauc yucca chip great idea combin cheek euro dessert actual full friend like tri share chocol coulant violet ice cream euro coulant light chocolatey howev cloy ideal violet ice cream creami rich violet sweet add littl fresh dish full enjoy last bite drink reason price order glass cava euro two bottl water euro end pay euro two explod time leav would say order reason cost roughli euro per person lunch time offer tapa size dish anyth menu dessert coffe glass beer hous wine euro hidden gem madrid far citi centr walkabl princesa shop street plaza de espa wanna tri modern spanish tapa lot idea love miss place great time definit go back,very good,5

The woman working there saw us standing outside and let us know that they'd be ready for us in 5 minutes. I was starving, tired, and overheated, so this was reassuring. Sure enough, 5 minutes later she let us in. She patiently explained each type of unconventional pizza (a nice change!) in the display multiple times to each of us before quickly grabbing our orders and popping each slice into the oven to warm up. She brought the pizza to our table promptly, and it was absolutely delicious!! I was worried about my 15 Euro budget, but it was only about 6 Euros for 2 large slices (got to sample 2 diff flavors!) and a drink. I was full and saved money!

There is real theatre with the Parrilla fired up with Argentinian charcoal. Our host assured us that it burns hotter leaving a sweater taste to the meat. To start, the Empanadas were very light with nicely spiced meat fillings. The Asado provided the main event with a great selection of the best Argentinian Aberdeen Angus steaks, I recommend the rib eye. In addition there was a good selection of chicken dishes.  Although none of our party sampled this dish, the selection of Argentinian meats served on a hot plate looked to be a very popular choice.

In a very clever way, they located the charcoal grill at the window for all the people in the street to see. Indeed this is their forte.

I ordered the sweetbread for a first course for both of us, this was a large portion and grilled just right. we followed this with the rib eye steak accompanied by grilled pepper and cooked vegetables. the steak was excellent.

I found it looking at the trip advisor reviews and we were not disappointed. We ordered some bread to start which was very reasonably priced at only €2 and it came out almost immediately. The service was also excellent throughout and the ones who spoke English were particularly helpful when we were ordering. I had a carpaccio and goats cheese pizza which was fantastic. The saltiness of the carpaccio beef and the sweetness of the goats cheese in honey balanced perfectly. My partner had a baked pasta which she said was tasty and cooked nicely. If I had any complaint, it'd be that it's slightly on the pricier side but considering the quality, I was more than happy to pay the prices.

They also made a plain pasta dish for our daughter with a simple pomodoro sauce.

The main course for those who chose fish or meat was copious, with a generous portion of meat and a reasonable side dish. For the same price, vegetarians got what i would call ""only the side dish"": a portion of candied vegetables.... topped with a few tiny fish fillets that looked like anchovies (have not tried those).

I am a beef lover, I eat beef 2, 3 times a week, I cook my own steaks and I tried quite a few meat types, american, french, belgian, scotish, uruguayan, argentinian, japaneese, romanian etc. I had some really good steaks at home, and very good ones going out. But so far the experience here in Madrid was the best. After the first time we ate, i said we have to try it again. The tenderloin was melting in your mouth, the rib eye was pleasantly greasy and with the nice bbq flavor of fried fat. If you want the juicy beef, go for the 500g ribeye steak. If you want lean meat, the tenderloin is excelent. The pepper souce is also very good.

We had the chorizo sausage and a sort of pasty for our starters which were nice and tasty. We had ordered the mixed grill which is a sharer for two for mains but while we were eating our starters we became aware of our waitress (who was otherwise lovely throughout as were the other staff) disconcertingly hovering, waiting for us to finish. I noticed that the mixed grill was waiting under their heat lamps so I don't know what was going on there! Everything was fine service-wise after that. On reflection we thought we should have ordered a steak because we've had better mixed grills. Some of the meat was a bit fatty for us and although we usually order our steaks rare we thought medium would be the safer call - but it was all pretty much bloody. The puds were nice and the atmosphere in the restaurant was lively as it was busy and it's well appointed. So not 5 stars but a solid 4 and, as I say, we would go for a steak next time because the ones our neighbours had looked scrummy.",2016-04-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d796535-Reviews-or550-La_Cabana_Argentina-Madrid.html,UID_2496,0.016,0.847,0.137,0.9829,0.1330922865013774,0.4640151515151515,0.3778875,1146,113,0.0986038394415357,1,21,False,46,0.217391304347826,0.0869565217391304,0.1739130434782608,0.0434782608695652,0.0869565217391304,0.0434782608695652,0.0869565217391304,0.0434782608695652,0.0869565217391304,0.1304347826086956,218,136,4.261467889908257,0,0,turn place friday night without book told first avail tabl pm book next night chorizo sausag sort pasti starter nice tasti order mix grill sharer two main eat starter becam awar waitress otherwis love throughout staff disconcertingli hover wait us finish notic mix grill wait heat lamp know go everyth fine servic wise reflect thought order steak better mix grill meat bit fatti us although usual order steak rare thought medium would safer call pretti much bloodi pud nice atmospher restaur live busi well appoint star solid say would go steak next time one neighbour look scrummi,very good,5

We just had some great salads, and wine, bread basket, and a shared starter which was great. At 19:00 the restaurant was quiet and service was quick. I would expect the waiters to speak better English, since that seems to be their target market. Menus are well setup in English and it has a non-tourist feeling inside. One small thing, though, when the table got to full with glasses and plates, our waiter moved the empty table next to us closer. If the place was packed, it would have been a tricky meal, but that gesture was nice. Was disappointed that that they did not have wifi in the restaurant.

The steak was that tender I could have cut it with a butter knife, the vegetables were tasty and the garlic and herb fries were delicious. All of this was finished off with a very tasty crepe. I wish I could say the same for our visit on the last night of our holiday. Again we received a friendly welcome by an English speaking waiter but the visit was let down by our steaks. I ordered medium and my husband ordered medium rare but both were extremely undercooked and had to be sent back. When they were bought back out my husband’s steak was rare but he ate but mine was still raw and cold in the middle. I did tell the waiter and pointed out to him the parts I’d had to leave. At a cost of €100 for two steaks, two sides, two deserts and bottle of wine I did expect more. Mixed feelings as I loved our first visit.

This was our last meal in Europe before heading back to the states and what a memorable one it was. We had tapas at three different restaurants while in the Barcelona and Madrid area and this was by far the best meal that we had. One of the things that made it so special was the very unique dishes with VERY fresh ingredients, vegetarian friendly and allowed you to have portion control. They had something for everyone. We ordered about 5 different dishes plus 2 desserts. Each of the dishes came out at a different time - you could tell that they were made on the spot that you were not getting anything that seemed to be prepared ahead of time. It was great because you had the chance to savor each one of the dishes before receiving the next and you were not rushed and could enjoy hot dishes hot and cold dishes cold. The bread was warm and tasty it was if they made it just for you! We had one or two meals from each one of the three categories in addition to our dessert. Make sure that you save room for dessert since we had a molten chocolate cake with lavender ice cream that was ""to die for""! All that being said the wait staff was extremely warm and friendly...

The restaurant has nice decor if maybe a little bright but that is typically Spanish. The tables were a bit too close together as you could almost join in the conversation with the table next to you. The food was very good, however. We had the Tavola as a starter, which was a selection of starters and was very good. We both had pasta mains and they were also very good. The only complaint was the service was too rushed as were served our main course before we'd finished our starter. We do like to have some time between courses - we're there for a dining experience not a race! Needless to say we didn't order our desserts straight away but when we did they were also very good.

Taberna Origen is several blocks into a neighborhood outside the tourist areas. It is just to the north of Plaza Espana, which is also a Metro stop. I would never have found it without TripAdvisor. We are making a short stop over in Madrid after almost three weeks in Spain, and the restaurant is just two blocks from our very quiet hotel in a very quiet neighborhood. The space is a bit odd. When we walked in, we though there were only two tables, both occupied, but a very enthusiastic waiter -- and maybe owner -- waived us into a back dining area with another 5 tables. We were in for lunch. My guess is reservations are a must for dinner. Very nicely decorated with white walls, dark furniture, and modern art. Really pleasant. This is a ""fusion"" restaurant, so knowing exactly what you are getting can be a challenge. They have an English version of the menu, which helps, but exactly what is cod fitters with pad Thai sauce? No one in the restaurant had good English, but we managed to get by with our limited conversational Spanish and a lot of good humor. We were adventurous, and the cod fritters we excellent. I am not sure what the pad Thai sauce was, other than it was light and a great accompaniment. The menu is tapas, media, and raciones, and you will not recognize a single item. Much to our delight, the menu had a number of vegetable options, including a cone of tempura vegetables with teriyaki sauce that was as fabulous as we had hoped. Our waiter helped us not over order by advising us to order media when our impulse was raciones. We were started with complementary tiny Spanish omelettes, which were a fusion of a German potato pancake and the ubiquitous Spanish omelette. Very delicate and an interesting twist. Cannot go wrong with potatoes in our book. A highlight for us was the boletus mushroom croquettes, which were all mushroom -- no cheese -- and just a burst of flavor. We also went for the tomato plate advised by several reviewers, and it was also surprising. What appeared were two beautifully vine ripened tomatoes still on the vine that were baked and had honey drizzled over them. Inside was a stuffing of sheep cheese chopped very fine. Amazing flavor.  In addition to the vegetable tempura and cod fritters, we also had a seafood lasagna with tomato, which included two very nice grilled scallops. I was expecting tomato sauce, but what came was deconstructed and had a cream sauce that beautifully played background to the seafood. The tomato was fresh slices with rounds of al dente pasta, almost like ravioli rounds. This was a meal of wonderful surprises that used the tapas format to great advantage without being greasy bar food. This is an inventive kitchen that loves food and knows cuisine. Total bill for two was €36, which is a bargain for two people. The overall menu, which we did not begin to sample, is organized into sections with vegetables, fish and seafood, and meat. We did not try anything from the meat section. The restaurant describes itself as fusion, and it is. It pays to be adventurous, because I am not sure that even with impeccable Spanish our preconceptions would have not carried the day. And this is the point of the restaurant: taking the dominant Spanish form and surprising you with wonderful food you could not imagine. I wish we had this restaurant in our home town. I just hope it's blooming success does not kill it.",2015-05-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6613386-Reviews-or180-Origen_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_2541,0.031,0.76,0.209,0.9993,0.3014832162373146,0.5244795732500649,0.3475461538461538,3545,303,0.0854724964739069,0,89,False,110,0.1074380165289256,0.1570247933884297,0.3471074380165289,0.0991735537190082,0.1487603305785124,0.0165289256198347,0.0082644628099173,0.024793388429752,0.0413223140495867,0.0495867768595041,627,340,4.653907496012759,0,0,give lot excel review spain trip advisor wonder resourc madrid c rdoba granada malaga taberna origen sever block neighborhood outsid tourist area north plaza espana also metro stop would never found without tripadvisor make short stop madrid almost three week spain restaur two block quiet hotel quiet neighborhood space bit odd walk though two tabl occupi enthusiast waiter mayb owner waiv us back dine area anoth tabl lunch guess reserv must dinner nice decor white wall dark furnitur modern art realli pleasant fusion restaur know exactli get challeng english version menu help exactli cod fitter pad thai sauc one restaur good english manag get limit convers spanish lot good humor adventur cod fritter excel sure pad thai sauc light great accompani menu tapa media racion recogn singl item much delight menu number veget option includ cone tempura veget teriyaki sauc fabul hope waiter help us order advis us order media impuls racion start complementari tini spanish omelett fusion german potato pancak ubiquit spanish omelett delic interest twist cannot go wrong potato book highlight us boletu mushroom croquett mushroom chees burst flavor also went tomato plate advis sever review also surpris appear two beauti vine ripen tomato still vine bake honey drizzl insid stuf sheep chees chop fine amaz flavor addit veget tempura cod fritter also seafood lasagna tomato includ two nice grill scallop expect tomato sauc came deconstruct cream sauc beauti play background seafood tomato fresh slice round al dent pasta almost like ravioli round meal wonder surpris use tapa format great advantag without greasi bar food invent kitchen love food know cuisin total bill two bargain two peopl overal menu begin sampl organ section veget fish seafood meat tri anyth meat section restaur describ fusion pay adventur sure even impecc spanish preconcept would carri day point restaur take domin spanish form surpris wonder food could imagin wish restaur home town hope bloom success kill,very good,5

We went on the Saturday night and decided to have the 7 course tasting menu at €34 per head. Every course was unusual, beautifully presented and explained in detail by our attentive waitress Michela. The service was very friendly and professional.  We had such a lovely evening that we decided to return again on the Sunday night. We again were looked after by Michela who when we said we would like the tasting menu again, spent time with us going through each course on the menu and made suggestions for different options. We ended up having a completely different tasting menu except for the cold soup starter and mango dessert which were both too good to not have again. The second tasting menu was even more incredible than the day before.  Taking into consideration the food, decor, service and price we both felt this was one of the best meals we have ever had and are only sad that the restaurant is based in Madrid and not somewhere in London where we can visit regularly!

Still adjusting to local late-eating habits, we were the first to arrive...","We had read about this downtown restaurant, liked the sound of it, and with the help of ""recepcion"" at the excellent ""Catalonia Las Cortes"" hotel, had booked a table for Friday night dinner. Still adjusting to local late-eating habits, we were the first to arrive on the night - it's a modern, well-appointed premises on Calle Imperial, with predominantly black/white decor + beaty music. Our welcome was friendly, and we had the distinct advantage of being able to pick a table. The Menu indicated a reasonable choice of Starters : my ""Better Half"" M selected a ""Hummus"" dish, while I went for the ""Home-made Foie Terrine"". The choice of Mains was disappointing : Squid, an obscure Japanese Fish, ""Spanish style"" Sweet & Sour Pork, Steak Tartare, and, believe it or not, Hamburger! Em, we both felt our only reasonable option was the Hamburger, despite the fact that we've eaten in more than a few restaurants with widely varying influences. As for wine, we attempted to order the seemingly better of the Rias Baixas offerings, but had to settle for the lesser option, making us wonder how much of the presented list was actually available? Anyway, we ordered, and as a preliminary we were presented with a ""Celery Mojito"" - our Server glowingly talked this up (a practice we discovered is part of the restaurant's approach) and it was quite tasty. As for our actual Starters, M pronounced her Hummus ""very tasty"", and my ""Terrine"", while beautifully presented, suffered from being too chilled, obscuring the flavour. Style, presentation and description are clearly ""big"" here, and we'll come back to that. Our Burgers (!) were in a kind-of layered format : M's was cooked as requested, while mine was nothing like the ""medium-well"" I had asked for in both Spanish & English. With a bit of ""theatre"" my Burger was taken back and replaced - one of the layers this time was about right, the other not. We sampled one of the Desserts - an apple crumble - again introduced to us with elaborate, glowing descriptions of its ingredients, and it was fair enough. Before the end, we were presented with fancy pastille-type sweets, on a special piece of stone (of course!). Our conclusion about this meal + our experience at ""Metro Bistro"" is simply this : you're clearly aspiring to be something ""different"", but before you get to be ""excellent"", you need to consistently get the ""basics"" right. For example, your choice of ""Mains"" is poor, and if you insist on including Hamburger, get the cooking right ; secondly, ensure that when the customer needs cutlery, he/she has it ; thirdly, if you're bringing a meal course to the table, make sure the last course has been cleared, if only for space reasons. And above all, don't confuse ""talking-up"" and ""fancy presentation"" with delivery of a good food & service product! Our Bill (pre-gratuity) was a very reasonable Euro 66-60, and we would commend our main Server Michaela for her good-humoured efforts.",2014-06-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6498928-Reviews-or480-Metro_Bistro_Plaza_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_1728,0.024,0.86,0.117,0.9933,0.2067978208232445,0.4489480764057036,0.3477499999999999,2947,223,0.0756701730573464,4,148,False,83,0.1470588235294117,0.1617647058823529,0.4558823529411764,0.0147058823529411,0.1029411764705882,0.0147058823529411,0.0147058823529411,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0294117647058823,501,315,4.884231536926148,0,0,read downtown restaur like sound help recepcion excel catalonia la cort hotel book tabl friday night dinner still adjust local late eat habit first arriv night modern well appoint premis call imperi predominantli black white decor beati music welcom friendli distinct advantag abl pick tabl menu indic reason choic starter better half select hummu dish went home made foie terrin choic main disappoint squid obscur japanes fish spanish style sweet sour pork steak tartar believ hamburg em felt reason option hamburg despit fact eaten restaur wide vari influenc wine attempt order seemingli better ria baixa offer settl lesser option make us wonder much present list actual avail anyway order preliminari present celeri mojito server glowingli talk practic discov part restaur approach quit tasti actual starter pronounc hummu tasti terrin beauti present suffer chill obscur flavour style present descript clearli big come back burger kind layer format cook request mine noth like medium well ask spanish english bit theatr burger taken back replac one layer time right sampl one dessert appl crumbl introduc us elabor glow descript ingredi fair enough end present fanci pastil type sweet special piec stone cours conclus meal experi metro bistro simpli clearli aspir someth differ get excel need consist get basic right exampl choic main poor insist includ hamburg get cook right secondli ensur custom need cutleri thirdli bring meal cours tabl make sure last cours clear space reason confus talk fanci present deliveri good food servic product bill pre gratuiti reason euro would commend main server michaela good humour effort,very good,5

It was slow cooked and served on a pureed truffled potato with crispy fried mushrooms on top. I was in heaven. The work mate across from me got the same and practically licked the plate.

They are obviously keen to impress here, and proud of their bistro, the staff were chatty and keen to describe the menu. We went for the 7 course taster menu – which for 35 euro each seemed a great deal. In summary, each of the dishes was very good, there was a nice amount of invention and creativity and it really felt like you were eating the food prepared in a Masterchef final. I’ve eaten in lots of other restaurants where I have paid more cash for less food, and lower quality, so this Bistro really was a great find which ticked all the right boxes (location, food, value, ambience and service).",2014-05-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6498928-Reviews-or480-Metro_Bistro_Plaza_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_2655,0.028,0.746,0.226,0.9846,0.2994359562006621,0.535995670995671,0.3772999999999999,743,67,0.0901749663526245,0,18,False,30,0.1351351351351351,0.1891891891891892,0.2432432432432432,0.054054054054054,0.2162162162162162,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.027027027027027,0.081081081081081,0.027027027027027,139,105,4.35251798561151,0,0,place well locat plaza mayor small shop front open insid new modern space obvious keen impress proud bistro staff chatti keen describ menu went cours taster menu euro seem great deal summari dish good nice amount invent creativ realli felt like eat food prepar masterchef final eaten lot restaur paid cash less food lower qualiti bistro realli great find tick right box locat food valu ambienc servic,very good,5

We had heard that Madrid rivaled Barcelona with regard to good food, but we had not been very impressed with the cuisine in Madrid before eating here. We wandered in about 7:30, hoping to make reservations for another night. They offered to take us on the spot, provided we promised to be done by 9:30 p.m. - no problem!! The interior decor is very modern but in a warm and inviting way. The wait staff were all very good, but especially Miguel. He was amazingly friendly and helpful, explaining each dish as he served it. We started with the complimentary celery mojito, which was absolutely wonderful - wish we could make that one at home! I had the salmorejo, the tipico cold tomato soup, which was out of this world. My husband had roasted potatoes with three different ""dips"" - he was delighted with all three. There was also a variety of breads which were divine, and I'm not a big bread eater. We both enjoyed our main course - the lamb was especially good - and we even managed dessert.

I asked about reservations via email and received a prompt and polite reply. Metro Bistro is on the far side of Plaza Mayor, but it doesn't have that tourist feel to it. We didn't want to go tourist, and MB most certainly was the best place we could have chosen. We started with a cheese plate and croquetas which were both great. I want to point out that we mentioned not liking bleu cheese, and they substituted for us. My husband had the pork, and i had the hamburger. I wanted the lamb but ended up with the burger because the veal/bacon combination sounded good. Both of our meals were delicious. We liked all of the breads, although we thought the cocoa/herb bread was a little weird. As others have mentioned, they started us with a celery mojito and finished the meal with amaretto and passion fruit jells. I have to say I loved the celery mojito. One note about service: We had two servers—a female and a male. The woman was kind enough, but she was not as warm and friendly as the man. I'm guessing the waiter's name was Ibrahim, although I'm not sure. He explained how he made the mojito, and when I accidentally fell getting out of the booth, he was right there to help me get up, get me water/wine/whatever.

Booked through email a few hours before with no issues. Was a little concerned when I showed up at 9 pm and the place was practically empty barring an American couple. But, I quickly decided on the 7-course menu degustacion (tasting menu) as I love chefs showcasing the best of what they can offer and I eat pretty much anything. Course after course of sumptious, delicious plates were put in front of me. Most of which didn't really look or feel much smaller than full sized plates (I compared with a couple of tables nearby who ordered ala carte). Here's what I got...(more or less since the waiter didn't speak too much English and my Spanish is basic at best). - Celery (and apple?) mojito amuse bouche: Delightfully refreshing shot - Salmorejo (typical cold Spanish tomato soup) with pesto oil and olive oil ice cream - 3 breads: Rosemary/chocolate/orange; White; Corn & chilli with rosemary butter and black olive butter. I only really liked the dark rosemary bread tbh - Terrine of foie gras and orange with a puree that tasted a little like plum - Stack of confit vegetables with salsa Romesco and some kind of fish slices - Squid stuffed with ham on a bed of black risotto and turmeric (or safron?) cream - perfectly cook and delicious! - Loin of pork that managed to be pink on the inside (sous vide?) and a bit crispy on the outside, with a red wine reduction, serviced with crispy filo rolls filled with red cabbage and a blueberry paste - Mango mouse, with mango slices wrapped around set yogurt - Death by Chocolate: Ultra light mousse, dense mousse, chocolate truffle and a small pot of warm chocolate sauce (I'm sure there's a more fancy word) with popping candy - loved loved the warm chocolate with popping candy! - Pastilles of amaretto and passion fruit I absolutely cleaned my plate. Some very accomplished (and technical) cooking and very few things that I didn't care for (mostly the bread). The price for all this? €32!! In the UK I've paid about £50 for the same quality and less food. Service was pretty attentive (they took time to explain the elements of the dish to me), although felt a bit rushed when the place filled up (after 10 pm). The clientelle is quite tourist based (probably both thanks to TripAdvisor and its location just outside of Plaza Mayor), but don't let that put you off, it really is excellent modern cooking with traditional influences.

We were greeted immediately by very friendly staff. They seated our party of 6 in the lovely back room that allowed easy conversation and a round table. We are a mixed diet party with one very strict vegetarian, four that prefer fish and vegetarian diet and one without limits. The menu here was suited for all but our very strict vegetarian guest. Were all disappointed by the choice of grilled vegetables when it arrived at her plate at room temperature and molded with eel on top. This was not described at all in the menu or by the waiter. We also were surprised by the house salad. The figs and lettuce varieties were nice, as was the dressing, but the goat cheese was a full round of cheese, and was far too much. We found a nice wine selection with prices ranging appropriately and many options. We enjoyed the appetizers: the bread selection, cheeses and the chef’s take on potatoes.  The main courses we shared included the Black Pearl—a scallops and black risotto dish with a curry sauce. This was delicious and fun but not the risotto you would likely expect. If you are not willing to experiment this might not be your choice. Two in our party ordered the Cod Casserole. The portion of fish was large. The sauce and vegetables were heavy and the fish was a bit overwhelmed by the surroundings. The Butter Fish was the best item on the menu. The fish was firm, well cooked and surrounded by a ginger and teriyaki based sauce. Very nice and a great treat.  But save space for the dessert. This was the gem of this visit. We ordered 2 for the table, the Chocolate and the Apple Tat. Our waiter recommended the proper order to eat the 5 separate chocolates and he was completely correct. WOW. The apple dessert was a great contrast. These are a must try if you choose this restaurant. After a 5 day visit, you should give it a try.

We spotted this place last night, but were too early to really appreciate it, so arrived later this evening, sat happily in the window and were treated to a great 3 course evening meal.  The freshly made, and imaginative bread (inc cacao and orange), served with rosemary butter and olive butter, set the stage well for later courses. Next up, the recommended croquettes and also veal with cream cheese. Both beautifully presented and delicious.  My teenage daughter then chose the squid on black risotto - which was very good - whilst I had the Spanish pork - again excellent. We thought we'd saved space for pudding - but were pretty much beaten by the chocolate dish - which could easily be shared by two!!

It was an unassuming place a few streets down but was already quite packed so we were seated at the bar. I was a little unsure about the tight space but the staff worked it very well!  We've been staying in an area where English is not prevalent so we again used (our terrible) Spanish to order but they offered us menus in English so we didn't have to struggle through the translations. We ordered the croquettes (not the shrimp ones), the cuttlefish burger, the steak tartar, and the oxtail to start with a bottle of wine (el bruja). They brought us some fresh bread and gazpacho of (I believe) beet juice and olive oil. It was extremely delicious and hinted at the delicacies to come! The croquettes came a few minutes after we had finished our starter and I was happily surprised to find they were stuffed with cream of mushroom! (Cream of mushroom is one of my favorite things ever invented). So if mushrooms are a favorite, the croquettes are definitely a must!! The cuttlefish burger, again came a few minutes after we had finished and our plates had been cleared, was amazing. The aioli was delicious with the fish (but not overpowering) and very tender fish. This was the hubby's most favorite. Next the steak tartar, very delicious and fresh! Seasoned similarly to a classical deviled egg with stone mustard and slightly sweet bits of pickle. The last ""entree"" was the only entree we ordered not tapas sized (because it was only available in 1/2 or full size). The oxtail was off the bone, and encased in a sausage casing and covered in sauce. I'm not a huge fan of shredded meat due to chunks of fat it it was tender and delicious! We had a little room for dessert so we ordered the cheesecake with the trio of jams. Delicious cheesecake (although I saw them microwave it quickly before serving which had worried me) and the jams were delicious but not necessarily the best I've had. The jams were an orange peel & honey, raspberry, and peach. The orange jam was slightly bitter on its own, but with the cheesecake it was more balanced. The raspberry was good and the peach was the hubby's favorite but I thought it tasted a little too sweet. Overall, we spent just a little under 50€ for the two of us and left stuffed so I thought it was reasonable but not the ""cheapest"" meal we've had (and we visited other restaurants that were amazing). I'd say definitely worth going and if you are looking to spend less, order a few tapas before visiting somewhere else for more food!",2015-06-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6613386-Reviews-or170-Origen_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_2722,0.045,0.775,0.18,0.9978,0.2187525134246445,0.519876753483311,0.2639625,2572,236,0.0917573872472783,8,71,False,72,0.0888888888888888,0.1888888888888888,0.2777777777777778,0.0555555555555555,0.1222222222222222,0.0444444444444444,0.0222222222222222,0.0333333333333333,0.1222222222222222,0.0444444444444444,466,256,4.51931330472103,0,0,new hubbi went origen watch sunset templ debod unassum place street alreadi quit pack seat bar littl unsur tight space staff work well stay area english preval use terribl spanish order offer us menu english struggl translat order croquett shrimp one cuttlefish burger steak tartar oxtail start bottl wine el bruja brought us fresh bread gazpacho believ beet juic oliv oil extrem delici hint delicaci come croquett came minut finish starter happili surpris find stuf cream mushroom cream mushroom one favorit thing ever invent mushroom favorit croquett definit must cuttlefish burger came minut finish plate clear amaz aioli delici fish overpow tender fish hubbi favorit next steak tartar delici fresh season similarli classic devil egg stone mustard slightli sweet bit pickl last entre entre order tapa size avail full size oxtail bone encas sausag case cover sauc huge fan shred meat due chunk fat tender delici littl room dessert order cheesecak trio jam delici cheesecak although saw microwav quickli serv worri jam delici necessarili best jam orang peel honey raspberri peach orang jam slightli bitter cheesecak balanc raspberri good peach hubbi favorit thought tast littl sweet overal spent littl two us left stuf thought reason cheapest meal visit restaur amaz say definit worth go look spend less order tapa visit somewher els food,very good,5

We were seated quickly without a reservation at around 9:40pm on a weeknight. We ordered the variety of meats to share along with a side of garlic and parsley chips/fries.  When we were sat down we were brought bread and olives. There was a garlic butter too which was very tasty. The bread is not free which might have been naive of me to think so but worth the about €3.50 I believe it cost. The variety of meats were the perfect size to share and delicious. We were brought out the wrong side, a plate of vegetables and the waitress, Laury, who brought them seemed to get annoyed with us when I brought it to her attention that the wrong side had been brought. I understand I’m working with high school level Spanish and that a language barrier can be frustrating, but I was able to say that we had ordered fries in Spanish. I found the huffing and attitude of the waitress while I tried my best to remember certain words to be off putting and it made us not order dessert like we had planned to. Anyway, we were then brought out normal fries. A bit of confusion with the language barrier with Laury and another member of staff but finally the garlic and parsley chips made their way to the table. These chips are the only part of the food that I can fault. They were soggy and honestly seemed like they had been microwaved.  When the bill arrived (after asking for it multiple times), it was wrong. We had been charged for sides that had been brought out in the error of the restaurant. We were given some after dinner liquor as a result of the wait, much appreciated! Also, thank you to Sebastian who helped to sort the errors on the bill out!  We had ordered wine as well with our meal and were finishing it after the meal. The waitress came by our table picking things up in a rush and putting her arms in between the view of my partner and I. I understand that cleaning and picking up has to be done, but I’ve also eaten in enough restaurants to know there’s a more professional manner in which to do so. The food is good here and I try to not let one bad apple ruin it all but it can be hard to enjoy the food when the atmosphere is wrong.

We were told they were full but that they would write our name on the reserve list. We turned up at 9pm as had been discussed on the phone and had a drink at the bar. It was extremely busy but luckily we got a seat at the bar area so it wasn’t too bad.  The frustrating thing for us was after an hour or so of waiting some couples that had definitely not booked got seated before us. The member of staff who was front of house clearly knew these couples after kissing and hugging them and made sure they got seated ahead of other people. More and more people started arriving and started complaining to the staff so it wasn’t just us.  The front of house guy was no where to be seen at times because he was too busy chatting away with his friends who he had sorted tables out for so the waiters were left dealing with the complaints. This was very poor from him and very unprofessional.  When we did finally get seated at 10.30pm we decided not to have a starter and just to have mains. We both went for the fillet steaks. I have to say that this was one of the best steaks I have ever had. I asked for it be medium and it was actually rare but as the steak was so good I didn’t mind too much. My partner asked for medium well and it was cooked perfectly.  I must also mention Sebastian who worked behind the bar who was English and dealt with any English speaking customers and took the phone calls if they were English. He was very polite, friendly and professional.

We wanted to get off just before the Grand Palace to avoid the crowds in the hope of finding somewhere more traditional - so glad we did. As we stepped off the bus tour I turned to my reliable trip advisor app in terms of where was nearby and here we landed. It is off a wee back street so as you are walking down you are not too sure what to expect. When we walked in we were greeted by a very warm host who offered us a table and swiftly a menu and drinks. The menu was so varied we wanted to try quite a few things - they split it into things from the sea, garden and land which was a nice way to know what you were eating and how to split your choices. We got a variety of dishes and shared them - the highlights being stuffed potatoes with mushrooms and apricot, sea bass ceviche and the rigatoni pasta which was also amazing. For some of the dishes they have the option of tapas, 1/2 portion and full portion which was helpful when you may want a bit more of some dishes. The staff were very helpful in telling us what would be a right amount for us and recommending their local specialities.

It isn’t open on Sunday so we walked to Plaza Mayor to try this one.  At about 9:30pm the restaurant was able to fit us in for dinner - a plus for us - and so it was to be a great experience.  It is my husband’s job to choose the wine and me, the food. He chose a Martin Berlugo Tempranillo - a good choice. I chose the flaming prawns with mushrooms and the slow cooked egg with mushrooms to start - both were magnificent.  We weren’t particularly starving hungry so for main we shared the black rice with scallops and a salad with figs and cheese for main.

The flavors here are really interesting, nothing is ""plain"" but also nothing is special without being delicious also. Even the butter that comes with the bread is flavored (we had one sage and one olive). Or entrees were the fish and the scallops, both of which had some hint of eastern flavor. Scallops were my favorite. The service was so lovely - so friendly and welcoming. They were giving tables samples of a cucumber drink they made. Our table ordered one.

All the staff were really friendly, personable and fun. They made us feel just a little bit special. However, what was special is Taberna Origen.

I thought about giving it 1/5, but to be fair, it's probably worthy of a 2 because it's clean, has a lovely atmosphere and the food and decoration is presented very well. But beyond that, there wasn't much else this restaurant can be complimented on. Of the four mains we tried, the fish was very plain, the Spanish sweet and sour pork ok but nothing fantastic (but probably the best out of the four we tried), the volcano rice good, but have had much better and oh, the chicken? It wasn't cooked through. When we told the waiter, he said that it was ok to eat (though I will add he was very nice). Not sure about Spain, but where we're from, chicken isn't like steak, where rare or medium rare is ok; chicken should be cooked through. Anyway, the manager was called over, looked over and apathetically asked if we'd like the chicken to be cooked more. There was no apology, no nothing, and when it came back, it was so salty and overcooked, it would've been better to eat wood.
