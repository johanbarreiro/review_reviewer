We are all vegetarians so we had done some research and had a list of places to try. By the end of 5 days we had eaten in 9 vegan/vegetarian restaurants (there is so much choice in Madrid, which is great!) and they were all good in terms of the food. However I have to say that Level Bistro was by far and away the best. Everything was just so good; the restaurant itself was modern with simple but elegant decor, the service was exemplary and the quality of the food outstanding, both in terms of taste and presentation. While not the cheapest place to eat, the price was very reasonable given the quality of the experience; I have paid a lot more for less good meals!

He completely lost it, got loud, said again very angry the kitchen was closed and we have to wait until 8 p.m. I said, well sorry, we leave if it is too complicated to ask a simple question. And he pretty much through us out of the restaurant. The kind ""Latino"" (I should have asked for his name) apologized again and again, the rude guy threw us out with bad comments and the only 1 guest they had was looking shocked at the scene. Maybe food is good, the place looked nice, and one waiter would get highest core. The rude dude would not work in my establishment a single day. I may go back to give it another chance and hope the kind Latino is there. If seeing the rude guy I will leave instantly. Also on another note, maybe they do not like children. Fair enough. But considering we (me and kids of 8 and 6 yrs) went there at 7.30 which for Spain is very early and the place was empty (apart of 1 guest) I feel this guy is just doing the wrong job. Also, if it was about the kids just state kids are not welcome. Season just started and there was no reason to treat us that way. Bad experience!

Isabel welcomed us like long lost friends at the door and escorted us to a quiet little table in the corner. Seems as if everyone else that evening was from Italy and having a grand time enjoying their meals and with lots wine flowing! We enjoyed our customery Marianito aperitif while we relaxed and viewed the Menu. To begin our therapy we chose the Leek and Duck Confit Salad and the Baby Artichokes Stuffed with Foie paired with a very cold and dry Cava, both seasonal specials and stunningly delicious. Our main courses were the Slow Cooked Lamb with Mint Chimichurri and the Pork Chumarro with Confit Onions. Both meltingly tender, cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. Seems we were well on our way to a full recovery.. specially thanks to the excellent David Moreno Crianza house Rioja!

After all of our travels and dining adventures Isabel, Pilar and Algarabia remain the closest to our hearts. Like the beloved Julia Child, Pilar exemplifies the 'Joy of Cooking' in every dish at Algarabia, served joyfully and with amazing grace by the inimitable Isabel. You will truly enjoy the Cuisine of Rioja at Algarab√≠a, but you will also be seduced by the warm hospitality and intimate atmosphere that this restaurant provides its guests. Over the years we have sampled many of Pilar signature dishes, yet each time we return we are thrilled by her new creations and off the menu seasonal specialties that Pilar and Isabel offer, often based on seasonal Rioja products, present their guests! One such surprise this year was a saute of Thistle, Boletus and Crispy Serrano Ham..WOW! who would have thought Thistle, of all things, could taste so good! Pilar also presented us with Crunchy Cones Filled with a Beef Tongue Salad.. an often maligned cut of beef elevated to high Riojan Cuisine. Old favorites we also enjoyed were Pilar's signature Rabo de Toro and Trigueros Crujiente, as well as the Bacalao a la Rioja. All this Joy was not experienced in one meal, we ate at Algarabia three times during our stay Madrid so that we had plenty of time to recover between Algarabia's feasts of the senses.

So we made an reservation and surprisingly, Miguel, the owner and Chef immediately remembered us. At our arrival we were treated as friends. Miguel prepared an outstanding tasting menue for us. A 9 dishes menue, one dish more delicious than the next. His own wine recommendation fitted perfectly. Even if the restaurant is a little bit outside, it¬¥s an absolute must during a stay in Madrid.

The effort and attention of the owners was exceptional.  The place looks a bit suspicious from the outside (old Spanish bar where you'd only find a Russian salad and bad wine). But as soon as you walk in, this changes. So don't be afraid. It's worth it. There's free parking around the area so that's a +10 points.

This is by far the best vegan restaurant we've been to and for me it was a repeat experience. The first visits in 2017, three nights in a row and in October 2018 four days in a row - three dinners one lunch. Right from the first impression (there‚Äôs never a second chance!) to the very end everything was simply perfect. A beautifully designed restaurant with many fine details, hospitality at its best with fantastic, attentive and swift service. Professionals at work! We've eaten everything(!) on the menue, some multiple times. Starters are amazing: The 24 hour Falafel, Veggie Rolls and Mushroom Brochettes. All three intense flavours due to the dehydration (Falafel and Veggie Roll) and the creamy pesto Genovese in the Mushroom Brochettes... Bellissimo! Pesto with pistachios, what an ingenious combination! Mushroom Papillote, what a taste explosion ‚Äì not just mushrooms but ‚Äûfancy‚Äú varieties and the sauce with Tarragon and a hint of Pernod ‚Äì wow! The other evening I had the crepe which was delicious and a host of herbs and tastes... For lunch the following day I went for the burger ‚Äì the best ever! The bun toasted in a way I‚Äôve never experienced before and it was actually possible to eat it with your hands and in such a way they stayed clean. Wedges well spiced and ‚Äûketchup‚Äú and ‚Äûmayonnaise‚Äú outstanding.  The desserts, WOW!  Cheese Cake, Frozen Petals, Double Chocolate Cake and Strawberry Kisses.  All desserts are out of this world. The texture and taste of the Cheese Cake amazing, the same with the Double Choc ‚Äì best ever and very fine! Frozen Petals ‚Äì just go for it, an experience in itself and not to be mistaken for ice cream. Strawberry Kisses... dehydrated layers of strawberry filled with Vanilla Cream ‚Äì OMG. Another dessert out of Heaven.  Considering all desserts are made with raw natural sweeteners and NO sugar and me being a Sweet Tooth & Chocoholic, I bow before you, oh great Goddess in the kitchen - her name is actually Julie - The Quality Queen behind all these delicious dishes!

However one factor stopped me. When the waiter came, we had already made our choice, which was one Mezze starter plate and one main dish for each one of us. However, he insisted that we should get another starter which we followed and at the end ended very full and heavy (in order not to waste food). The philosophy behind vegan food is that it is basic, simple with preferably zero waste and this behavior contradicts with that.

It's in a great location next to the Retiro park and we luckily got a table near the entrance with a lovely view of the park. As we decided to order three different starters and mains and share them among the three of us, they brought us each dish separately so we could savour and enjoy. Every time they served us a dish, the waiting staff explained what it was made of. The starters were tasty but on the small side. The mains, however, were amazing (although we shouldn't have ordered the burger in hindsight as it was difficult to divide into three and not as special as the other dishes). Especially good was the house specialty, the raw lasagna. We're not big fans of raw food and only ordered it on the waiter's recommendation but we're so glad we did as it was fantastic. For dessert, we had double chocolate cake and two chocolate mousses, which were both scrummy.

A plate of iced p√©talos to share for dessert and we left very contented, thinking about what we would order on our next visit (perhaps a starter each and then a dessert each - we'll see!). A small but varied selection of craft beers too - the B√°ias from el pa√≠s vasco was very good, though at 6%, stronger than expected - I mistook the price (4.1) for the alcohol content.

The atmosphere is nice, but it ends there.  My husband and our two children were seated right by the door for some reason, despite us having a reservation and the place was completely empty. Trouble is, there was constantly a breeze from the door with waiters coming in and out. People started to pile in within 30 min, so that created more discomfort with the breeze. The food was bla. Sardines and salad with anchovies were the highlights. We also had the shrimp rice dish, it was a disappointment (and at first they got the order wrong). Our kids barely touched it.

We shared some jamon iberico to go with their delicious bread and also ordered some stuffed tomatoes that came three in the order and were delicious. We all ordered the solomillo and thoroughly enjoyed it, though one member of our party was disappointed because though he sent it back it still was too undercooked for him. Keep in mind that the Spanish don't normally eat well done or overcooked meats so if this is how you like it then make a point of telling your server.  We washed down our dishes with a wonderful Ribera del Duero red wine. For dessert I had an interesting rice cream concoction with a tiny scoop of ice cream.

How happy we are that we did.  I reserved a table by email a week ago and had an instant response.  We wanted to book for Sunday night but was told by Miguel the owner that unfortunately they didn't open late in the evening on Sunday's.  So I then requested Saturday night which was fine.  I got to the airport yesterday morning and forgot the time I reserved so sent a mail requesting a reminder, when we got to Madrid there was a mail for me and he said that our table was booked come when you like. Fantastic.  Can I just say that from the start to the end of the evening everything from the food to the service was Superb.  The staff are very friendly and courteous, we were asked if we had a reservation and shown to our table outside, it had my name on it, then we had drinks and said we just wanted to wait to order for a bit.  While we sat Miguel came and introduced himself, we spoke in Spanish but he speaks broken English and his staff do.  When we were ready we asked for the menu, they do tapas and mains so my wife had tempura prawns and morcillo black sausage, delicious, and I had cured ham with olive oil and herbs and solomillo steak with fried potatos and peppers, again delicious.  When the bill came we couldn't believe how reasonable it was, 2 large beers, 3 glasses of wine and the food came to ‚Ç¨55.  At the end of the evening Miguel unlocked a gate and showed us a shortcut back to the metro.  You must visit this restaurant, we stayed in the Liabeny Hotel in the centre of Madrid and it was easy to get there.

The atmosphere in the restaurant was incredibly warm and honest. The food was fresh and bursting in flavour! We were warmly greeted by Fernando and promptly ushered to our table. As we spoke very little Spanish, Fernando kindly provided an English translation in print. With his help, we ordered empanadillas (must try), grilled prawns, calamari and mushrooms. The dishes were simple and unpretentious, whilst the quality of ingredients used were top-notch. The grilled calamari was crisp on the outside, smooth and juicy on the inside. Hands down the best grilled calamari we have ever had. The mushrooms were served with thinly sliced cured ham and a healthy dose of garlic and olive oil. Yum! We also enjoyed the most amazing acorn dessert wine and orange sorbet drink after dinner.  Eiffel's food, service and atmosphere made for an excellent dinner.

It was our last meal in Madrid just before our flight home and we spent 2 hours in the sun enjoying wonderful food with a bottle of cava. It was exactly how we wanted to end our trip to Spain. We even bought a kg of the Cecina de Le√≥n en Carpaccio which is beef and Miguel sliced it and packed it into 100gm packs vacuumed sealed for the plane. We were there for lunch and we arrived at 12.30 (early for lunch in Spain), even though the inside of the restaurant was empty, we were told that it was fully booked so we took a table outside. As we were eating, the restaurant filled up quickly with locals (always a good sign) who were there for their weekend family lunch.

We arrived at Eiffel rather early compared to the usual dinner time, yet the waitress still attended to us. Although she couldn't speak English, and we couldn't speak Spanish, we manage to overcome the language barrier using Google translate and her recommendations were superb! It was only sometime later that we found out she was the cook alongside with her mother! For starters, we had the Cecina cured ham, crunchy chicken salad, and the empanadillas casera. All three starters were magnificent and that's only the beginning. We later had 350 grams of well cooked steak (entrec√¥te) and also the homemade oxtail stew. The fat of the steak melted like butter and the meat was juicy! The oxtail meat was tender and soft, whereas the stew had burst of herb flavours with carrots and onions and seemed to be the savoury nectar of heaven. Besides that, we had the grilled pork ears which were amazing! The dinner was then finished off with two scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with generous amounts of strawberry sauce and also their homemade custard which was sprinkled with cinnamon powder. We were also given tangerine sorbets which were on the house and was a perfect end for a dinner in summer. Looking at the bill in the end, the price of the food were reasonable and definitely bang for buck for quality and quantity!

Hop out at Casa de Campo and Google map iot from there. It's about a ten-minute walk, and you have to make something of a loop. As you walk away from the Metro station, it is best to be on the right hand side of the road - there is less hassle getting under the bridge that way. As a number of reviewers have already said, Eiffel doesn't look like much. It's the most unassuming place you could imagine. Some people may even be tempted to turn around and sneak away. Don't do it! You're in for a real treat. This is excellent, straightforward, wonderfully-cooked food which you'll be grinning about all the way back home.

In the unlikely situation you were wandering along the road you wouldn't give it a second glance. However step inside and the staff greet you like an old friend. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome, encourage you to taste the dishes they have built their reputation on and smile with the genuine warmth of people who really love what they do. I chose the 'bull tale (sic) stew', which was tasty, tender and very filling. When I decided not to have a dessert, the waiter immediately went and got me a small lemon sorbet on the house.

When we arrived we noticed there was seating outdoors, in a little bar area, and then a private little dinning room. As we got to our table there was a little printed sign with our name on it that said reserved...very personal and sweet. We were greeted by our server who took excellent care of us all night? He spoke in Spanish and English when needed. He brought out some delicious bread with what they call ""liquid gold""...olive oil. yum! We ordered all kinds of stuff and we were just amazed by the taste and presentation. My hubby had the spinach and cheese empanadas which were amazing! I had the fried shrimp with the wasabi mayo....probably some of the best tasting shrimp I have ever had! For our entrees we had the lamb and the Rabo de Toro Estofado. Both were prepared perfectly...loved their potatoes too! The owner Miguel came to speak to us towards the end to make sure all was too our liking and was kind enough to call a taxi for us when we were ready to go. We loved this place so much that on our last night in Madrid we decided to go back!

I tried the 8 course tasting menu. At 21 euro it was a good deal by any objective standard. Everything was beautiful and creative and tasted good, but not excellent or special. All the food tasted very traditional and well prepared but was made to look more spectacular by it's impressive presentation. I have no complaints at all with the meal, but it was not to the standards of a tasting menu one would expect in a top 10 restaurant. The main dining room was nice, but a bit amateur. Paper place mats and napkins, and such. There was a bar and outdoor seating area and it was full of locals and families. I give them credit for trying to push the envelope and they do present a nice experience for a reasonable price. But if you are accustomed to a 60 euro tasting menu don't expect the same quality of food here. If you want a good traditional meal with a bit of a creative twist at an excellent price, then this is a definite winner.",2016-06-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991522-Reviews-or30-Eiffel-Madrid.html,UID_286,0.028,0.706,0.266,0.9948,0.3897284226190475,0.6526488095238097,0.5145916666666667,1054,101,0.0958254269449715,0,20,False,48,0.1647058823529411,0.1764705882352941,0.3294117647058823,0.1176470588235294,0.2117647058823529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,196,123,4.38265306122449,0,0,servic good staff friendli present excel creativ cours tri cours tast menu euro good deal object standard everyth beauti creativ tast good excel special food tast tradit well prepar made look spectacular impress present complaint meal standard tast menu one would expect top restaur main dine room nice bit amateur paper place mat napkin bar outdoor seat area full local famili give credit tri push envelop present nice experi reason price accustom euro tast menu expect qualiti food want good tradit meal bit creativ twist excel price definit winner,very good,5

Uber was about 13‚Ç¨ and the server called a taxi for the return because there was a futbol game and no Uber available outside the city center. Taxi was about the same for the return. The food was outstanding. Not what you would expect from a quaint little neighborhood place. We did the tasting menu and it was amazing which included a plate of 4-5 desserts. I would highly recommend it. Quite a lot of food for the price and the server brought us free drinks after the meal. A neighboring table informed us that is common in places like that to have a drink after dinner. You likely won't get that at a tourist restaurant. We didn't know what we wanted so he brought us 4 glasses with ice and 4 bottles of liquor. He just left them at the table for us to have whatever we liked.

It is a small and very friendly restaurant and we were made to feel so welcome. Our waiter (I think his name was Fernando , sorry if I'm wrong!!) was absolutely fantastic. He gave us recommendations and helped us with the menu  My daughter and I had the tasting menu between us. WELL! What a treat! A starter of 'Tuna Ferraro Rocher' Prawn tempura , and fried black pudding. Then we were brought a plate of Spanish ham , after that , chicken salad , Then a main of Oxtail stew , then a selection of deserts , finished with coffee and then a liqueur. My husband and elder daughter had steak which was just as good. Now , back home in England , I have eaten in 'fine dining' restaurants , but NOTHING compares to the meal we had here at Eiffel. From the warm friendly service , to the quality ,and amazing value of the food. This is not the 'biggest' or 'poshest' restaurant in Madrid , but if you venture out of the city to this modest little restaurant , you will not be disappointed.  Home cooked family food at its best.

Since we hadn't made any plans for the day except to adjust to the time difference, we decided that we would at least try to find somewhere nice to eat. We discovered Eiffel on trip advisor and thought we would give it a try. We were glad we did.  We had trouble understanding the menu so the server gave me the wifi code so that I could check there website for an English translation. Our server spoke enough English to help us understand what we were ordering. He suggested the oxtail stew which he promised would not disappoint. To his credit he was right. Coming from a Jamaican background it tasted like what I was accustomed to. My wife had the chicken salad that was equally impressive. All his suggestions were fabulous so we decided to trust his judgment when it came to desert. We had a sampler of a few different items and this was also great.  I found that they were very accommodating and extremely friendly. The location of the restaurant was a bit of a distance from where we were staying, but it was well worth it.

Pilar cooks food in the traditional style of La Rioja, where the sisters grew up, accompanied by the restaurant‚Äôs own special red wine from the region. The dining room is cozy and quiet, but brightened by flutters of lovely conversation, especially when Isabel comes by the tables to chat. I recommend Pilar‚Äôs homemade pat√© and anything cooked with mushrooms is sure to be delicious. Seasonal ingredients are always used and cooked perfectly. It is a good idea to order the menu of the day, as you‚Äôll be able to try the best dishes of the season, as long as you‚Äôre open to eating anything. Be sure to reserve a table in advance because the restaurant is well known by both Madrile√±os and travelers who return to dine with the sisters.

Isabel greeted us with warm hugs & kisses as we introduced her to our friends as it was their first time dining at Algarabia. She made us feel welcome and special as she showed to our table. Our friend is a pescatarian so we were presented with cheese from Rioja and olives as well as the delicious house pat√© with warm crusty bread to enjoy with a glass of cava. We also enjoyed a shot of rich and creamy clam chowder. We all shared starters of bacalao croquetas, crispy asparagus, salt√© of prawns, mushroom and borage and sauteed artichokes and fava beans. All delicious, beautifully presented and graciously served by Isabel. Our friends both chose the Bacalao a la Rioja and we both opted for the Baked Merluza with orange migas. Both dishes were  cooked to perfection with the fish moist and beautifully seasoned.  We managed to consume two bottles of the excellent house Rioja before it was time for dessert. We shared Soto Pears stewed in Rioja and the Crema Fria with caramel, both satisfying and light to finish our dinner with friends. When Chef Pilar came out to greet her guests she was met with a round of well deserved applause. ¬°Brava!

A warm welcome by Isabel, who is caring about the guests, Pilar is the (only) cook. We choose foie gras and quail breast as starters. The foie gras was extremely good and definitely home made, first class! Quail breast was okay, with some ham added to prevent it from getting dry, which unfortunately influenced taste too much. The main course was cod in tomato and oxtail stew. Both dishes were flat in taste and there were no side dishes whatsoever, not even a single leave of lettuce. Dessert was an apple toffee cream, which was good. We ordered some glasses of house wine and a bottle of water with our menu. We paid ‚Ç¨120, which is given the prices of restaurants in Madrid and the food served, simply too much. The ladies really do their best and are super friendly, but the food needs a bit more decoration and taste. A top 100 position among 11000 restaurants in Madrid is absolutely overrated.

This time it was twice in four days, as the first dinner was so delicious that we decided it was worth a second wonderful experience. Isabel and Pilar pampered us so well that the only thing we could do was to go again. This tiny cozy place is a little food paradise of Rioja cuisine.

Eventually we went and I had the nicest meal I have ever had in Madrid. The dining room itself is beautifully presented, with vases of lilies, and lovely lighting (it's so hard to get a well-lit dining room in Madrid - most places are so bright!). The tables are not too close together, so there's a very pleasant hum in the room, and the waiters talk at a low volume. It just felt so peaceful compared to the fun but very noisy atmosphere in the vast majority of restaurants here. We ordered a few of the specials (amazing artichokes and porcini mushrooms) and a few of the regulars (the leeks and the steak tartare). The specials were absolutely delicious, and the steak tartare was a dream; I personally didn't find the leeks too interesting, but I know other reviewers liked them.

The restaurant was nearly empty, only a couple of customers were sat having lunch and two girls in the bar. The waiter asked to us what want we to order. I answered him we want to have two red wines.

This restaurant and the owner Marcos are everything we had read previously and more. We decided to go at lunch time and arrived just as they were opening. Lucky us! Since we were the only ones there Marcos spent a great deal of time explaining dishes on and off the menu. We decided we wanted to try them all and he made smaller portions of 5 items. We started with an amazing tomato soup that tasted like eating a fresh tomato in season. It was followed by winter baby artichokes and leek confit with romesco sauce (his own version with hazelnuts and almonds). The fish of the day was red mullet cooked sous vide and carmelized with a torch. Marcos saved the best for last - to die for porcini mushrooms.

The restaurant is small and cozy, as you enter you are immediately greeted by Isabel, who makes you feel at home within seconds. Do not hesitate to ask Isabel for recommendations as everything on the menu is simply delicious! We shared 6 starters, which were brought one after the other to allow to focus on each dish properly and avoid jumping on all the plates buffet style! By the end of the starters, we were eagerly waiting for our main courses which were just as good as the rest of the experience until then. We accompanied the food with the house wine, which, like Isabel and her sister Pilar (the chef) is from the Rioja region and made specially for the restaurant.

Summing it up, this is not a ""temple"" of food ... this is a space you go to for comfort, welcome, laughs, and a meal that will satisfy on many levels ... and you walk out wondering why there are not more places where the owners make such an effort to make everyone in the room feel like family!

Two wonderful sisters, Isobel and Pilar, who are from Galicia, run it. Isobel, who is a character in the best way possible, runs the front of the house and she will, with her limited English, guide you through the menu. My meal was like having a Christmas feast in A Caruna - a classic Galician fish dish. She picked a young Rioja wine at reasonable cost and it was just fine. I would write about what my wife had to eat but we can‚Äôt remember anything other than it was fish and it was spectacular. We shared the apple and toffee foam dessert and it was one of the best we have ever had. We got just enough attention from Isobel throughout the meal to feel extremely well cared for and then at the end she brought her sister Pilar out from the kitchen to say hello. If you want to have a delightful and intimate dining experience in Madrid this is the place to go.

Over 3 years living here, we have eaten in lots of restaurants and few have succeeded in providing such a charming evening like this restaurant. It opens later than usual restaurants (21.30 hrs) and often you have to buzz to get in as they kept door closed for winter. Inside the violet doors with overflowing ivy over the windows, the atmosphere is almost like a vintage french bistro. Tables are small, decorations are kitsch and antiques. The maitre and cook (sisters) are all there is to the staff of this restaurant. They will both step out to chat if you are there on a less crowded day. The maitre is artistic and considerably well traveled. So in a way the atmosphere is more like being invited to a local vintage collector's home to dine than be guest of a real professional restaurant.  Food wise, we have no complaints at all. The asparagus dish was the highlight and worthy of a trophy on its own. The oxtail stew is one of the softest melt in your mouth in town (trust us we tried a lot). Yet the highlight is the traditional Riojano pork dish.. it's just so heavenly good. Dessert didn't disappoint either even if it's not as sweet or creamy (perhaps designed more for grown ups?). Portions are small but the bread basket and free pate does fill you.  It is not cheap to eat here, however quality wise it's not bad at all (there are extensive listed, starred and recommended restaurants in Madrid that cost more and offer less.. some also listed here). The only thing we didn't like is the house wine which we thought was a little too standard for a Riojano restaurant . We might try the considerably long handwritten wine list next time.

At a cost of Eu100 three of us enjoyed a delicious Rioja red, and the menu de degustation. The only problem was when the hostess poured my wife a gin and my wife forgot to say ""When"".  The two sisters who run the place are eccentric, but very talented at what they do. The major problem the place has is that it so highly rated on Trip Advisor.

I cant really fault the food. I had poached egg & truffle pasta to start and then the blow torched red tuna for the main. Both were tasty and a level of preparation was done in front of me.  I asked to see the wine list but instead was brought an open bottle of Rioja and had it poured whilst being told it was the 'house' wine. Not really sure what that was about and the first time anyone has made an assumption I don't want to choose what I drink before.  Overall it's not a bad restaurant.

I opened my trusty Trip Advisor City Guides app and did a quick search of the area. Algarabia was ranked sixth in Madrid, it was close by and the reviews touted it as a place for locals. Just my style.  The restaurant did not disappoint. As many reviewers have noted, the host, Isabel, is a sweetheart. Despite my very limited Spanish and her limited English we managed some conversation. She made sure I was aware that Algarabia is a real ""Riojana"" restaurant. Eventually she asked how I had heard about it and I showed her the Trip Advisor app. When I explained that Algarabia was the 6th ranked restaurant in all of Madrid she was very excited. I showed her a review that mentioned her by name and she brought one of the other patrons over to translate for her. I think we made her night.  The food was rustic and wonderful. I started with the green salad with leeks and ham and went with the stewed oxtail for the main course. Both were delicious. The dressing on the salad was just right and the oxtail was melt-in-your-mouth tender, topped with a brown sauce and potato hay. Isabel recommended a nice Rioja wine (2004 Vobiscum, from Bodega David Moreno). A great wine at 36 Euro and perfect with the oxtail. For dessert I took Isabel's advice and had a wedge of dark chocolate and rasberry on a cookie crust. Isabel said ""No spoon. Eat like pizza,"" so I picked it up and took a big bite. Delicious! The bitter dark chocolate was offset nicely by the rasberry and sweet cookie crust.  On my way out Isabel introduced me to Pilar, her sister and the chef. I promised I would add my own review to Trip Advisor. So here you are, Isabel and Pilar. Thank you for a wonderful meal and for making me feel at home in Madrid.

From the Greek-yet-cosmopolitan interior design to the lovely music and great atmosphere as well as the wonderful food, there is absolutely nothing negative to be said about this place. As if the Greek-y vibes and delicious dishes weren‚Äôt enough, the staff also makes sure to offer their best form of Greek hospitality and service, perhaps in a bid to upstage the neighboring venues staffed by Spaniards. Since customer service and dedicated waiters are practically non-existent in Madrid, it‚Äôs a great relief to come here and find people that actually seem to care about your experience. Furthermore, the prices are pretty reasonable and for the ‚Äúmenu del d√≠a‚Äù, practically a bargain. Though it now runs at 11 euros, it offers a great variety of Greek dishes and is the perfect opportunity to try new things as well as experiment. Despite being the ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù option (which is often done carelessly in other places), each dish is still nicely arranged and timely served, hence making it a fulfilling three-course lunch experience. The cherry on top is of course the dessert which is a small slice of cake/pastry topped with vanilla ice cream and cinnamon spice (though yogurt and other options are also available). Perfection?

Minutes later the waitress came over and asked what was wrong but just shrugged her shoulders when we told her. The waitress had seen the remains of the burnt offering in the kitchen. So no apology and they insisted we pay the full price of the meal.  So fair to say we will never be back at this Dionisos in Calle San Gregorio Madrid.

We called Algarabia and Isabel let us us know with a hearty laugh she could have a bottle of icy cold Cava waiting for us at 2000.. and off to Rioja we went! Arriving at Alagarabia is always like coming home, greeted by Isabe'sl warm hugs and kisses and the wonderful aromas of Pilar in the kitchen.  There are many new dishes on the menu so we opted for a mix of the new and some of our old favorites. Pilar's signature croquettes and crispy asparagus are always a must for starters, but the pasta with rabbit bolognese is now on our list as well. Pilar suggested we also try the sautee of borage, mushrooms and shrimp before moving onto mains and the house Rioja, so add one more to our list.. just keep the Cava coming! For mains we opted for an old favorite, Pilar's classic ox tail in red wine sauce, in my opinion Madrid's finest rendition of this classic dish. For the new, bacalao a la Riojana was intensely satisfying, the delicate cod just caressed by the rich sauce. Both dishes paired beautifully with the David Moreno house Rioja.

I stumbled into multiple great reviews on this site for Algarabia Restaurant and thought that it would be the perfect mix as it is owned by two sisters as I was bringing my two daughters and wife. Not only were the bechamel croquetas the perfect blend of creamy crunchiness, and their version of rabo encendido, perfectly slowed cooked - the meat barely hanging to the bone, dressed with a strong but not overpowering reduction, the bacalao flaky and fresh, the pear dessert, an unassuming simple but just the right sweetness to finish the dinner with a bang. All these things would make the experience memorable in any other restaurant. But when you add the personality of the two sisters, one that entertains and manage the floor and the other one that cooks, then this becomes a very special experience.

I did my research on TA and decided on Algarabia, near the opera on a side street and a short walk from our hotel. It is a small restaurant, maybe 6 - 8 tables, a very homey atmosphere (looks like that is what it was - a house - and we were in the living room!). We got a large table in a corner. I made our reservation online a few weeks in advance and got one for their opening time. Even so, two other tables were filled and all were filled within the hour, so reservations are highly recommended. We had several appetizers, including quail legs (see picture), which were quite interesting. All entrees were delicious (cod, pasta, very lean beef). Excellent wine. We had a great time and got the obligatory picture with Pilar, sorry I didn't get one with Isabel (the two sisters-owners).

I was the only guest of the restaurant when I arrived, but I did not feel uncomfortable more a special guest.  I was given a small dish of pate whilst I read the menu. It was delicious.  I then ordered a fried asparagus and a braised pork and caramelized onion. Both were the highlights of my trip to Madrid.  Normally I would stop there, but was convinced to try the black chocolate tart. It was also delicious, as was the wine. I got to talking with both the ladies of this restaurant. It was just like being with family. I had eaten in a lot of restaurants in the past week as a solo diner but this was the first restaurant that made me feel welcome rather than a person who should be put in the corner or pitied.

Algarab√≠a (meaning gibberish, from Arabic al-Arabiya literally meaning ""Arabic"") was one of the last recommendations for the area in our Lonely Planet guidebook and we almost didn't go because it was just one dollar sign, and usually we choose two dollar sign places hoping that price equates to quality. Rookie mistake!  We walked in just as the only other table was chatting with the chef and leaving. We thought perhaps this restaurant too would turn us away but an ""este bien"" got us seated. The host/waitress was a sweet middle aged woman who explained that she and her sister, the chef, owned the place and they served Rioja food which was famous for its wines, not its food, though it should be. And it should be! Everything was very reasonably priced. The wine was wonderful. We were brought a complimentary p√¢t√© (""the speciality of the house,"" she said, ""my sister made this,"") which is one of the best I've ever had. We had the escargot (Rioja style--many small snails in tomato broth) and the oxtail which was as tender as prime rib and more tasty. At the end of the meal we had a dark chocolate and raspberry tart which was incredible and a nice chat with the two sisters in the empty restaurant.  This was definitely one of the best meals I've ever had and if I ate it in a nice restaurant in my home state of Oklahoma it would have cost double. I'm sure my wife and I will always remember our honeymoon in Madrid fondly because of nights and food and people like this.

Fortunately, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise - Algarabia was everything we could have wanted and more.  If I hadn't read about Algarabia on Trip Advisor, I could easily have walked straight past it - from the outside it looked closed - the door was shut and there was no 'open/closed' sign. Nevertheless, once inside, we received a warm welcome from the hostess - she speaks very little English, but it's clear that Algarabia isn't set up primarily to cater for tourists and that suited us fine - we loved the authentic bohemian atmosphere.  As for the food itself, it was the best meal we'd had all holiday. The menu was creative and unusual - particularly memorable were the squared lambs feet - utterly different from anything either my partner or I had ever tasted before. A fantastic finishing touch was that after the meal, the chef took the time to individually talk to all the diners in the restaurant.

The very friendly, thoughtful, and attentive service reinforces the impression of being honoured and long-awaited guests rather than paying customers. We had dinner with friends here and, more recently, a lunch with the two of us. In both cases we were completely happy. The menu is short, but all the dishes we sampled here were delicious. When we had made our choices, the owner suggested he serve us two half-size portions of the starters rather than complete ones, worrying that otherwise we would order more than we could eat. These starters (leeks! and artichoke hearts) are subtle, original vegetarian dishes. The pulpo and mackerel were no less tasty. The sweets were worthy conclusions. Since this is a vinoteca, the restaurant has many open wines, and generously offers its guests a sip of two to decide which they like best.

We ended up eating at La Vaca Veronica, a couple of doors down the road. This was a mistake. (OK meal but the owner was offensive and rude who deserves nobody's loyalty - full review to follow shortly!) However, this gem left a lasting and favourable impression. It just looks like a place where you will enjoy a great meal. Which is precisely what we did today after making a reservation. It was worth the wait. Moratin Vinoteca is a small, welcoming, cosy and understated space with a bookish look about it, accentuated by the well-chosen prints and shelves lined with art books and stylish bric-a-brac. No flourescent tubes to offend your eyeballs here. Lighting is underplayed and tasteful. It must be a treat to eat here in the evening, judging by previous reviews. All the design elements combine to lend the restaurant a wonderfully relaxed and relaxing atmosphere. The menu is short. But it is long in interest. Don't expect plates of curling jamon or slices of dried-out tortilla. This menu is full of the tantalising and unusual and wonderfully fresh. Prices are very fair with starters up to around 12 euros and most mains at around 14 euros. Be adventurous and be delighted. We couldn't decide between the tempting starters. So we chose two. The first was the remarkable tiny, juicy artichokes with olive oil and sal de cecina. Cecina is a delicious dried and cured beef that is appreciated throughout Spain and often served as an aperitivo. Here, to make the ""sal"" (salt) they grate it over the artichokes and the result is exquisite. A brilliant and surprising pairing that was delicate yet full of flavour.  Our second starter was mi-cuit of monkfish livers with baby broad beans. This, too, was full of subtlety and taste. The mi-cuit was much more restrained in flavour than goose or duck liver and you'd need to be told it was fish in a blind test. It was, like the previous dish, a blend of less-than-obvious and contrasting ingredients that combine to provide something irresistible. It's alchemy. My main was steak tartare. This may seem unadventurous when there are more inventive and interesting dishes on offer. But it's a dish that should only be chosen in the best restaurants. With no cooking to disguise inferior quality, its success - or failure - depends entirely on the quality of (literally) raw materials and the chef's restraint and skill in combining the meat with the few ingredients to produce a sublime dish. Here the dish is prepared in the kitchen (not in front of you as sometimes happens in more showy restaurants in France, for example) and it is served with a couple of small pieces of toast to provide some crunch to contrast with the succulent meat. I also chose the option of it being slightly more picante than usual. Good choice. It was as good as any steak tartare I have ever eaten. And that is a lot of very good raw meat to beat, if you get my drift. To choose steak tartare in any restaurant is to put your well-being in the hands of the chef. Red meat and egg needs to be very fresh to be eaten raw. Several hours later, as I write my review, I can safely report that the only ill-effect of having eaten this dish at lunchtime is that I am not eating it right now. Oh..and it produces an uncontrollable flow of saliva whenever it is remembered. Eat this if you like red meat. My wife chose the canneloni with carrilleras and vegetables. Carrilleras are pig's cheeks. This may sound unappetising to the uninitiated but it is one of the most delicious cuts of meat if treated correctly, which means cooking slowly and patiently to produce an incredibly tender and tasty meal. I had a taste and can vouch for this dish. Mouth-watering. We ended our meal with the superb chocolate coulant-filled sponge and a perfectly-judged sour cream that was distincty yoghurty.  Our choice of dishes called for a red although the warm spring weather on the day we ate here meant we didn't fancy anything too heavy. The chef/owner (?) recommended a bottle of Treintamil Maravedies. This is a young blend of Grenache, Tempranillo and Syrah from the Bodega Maranones in the Madrid region. It was elegant, and aromatic with a taste of red fruits and a little pepper while being smooth and rounded. It was perfect with our choice of dishes and very easy drinking. Not too hard on the pocket, either, at around 19 euros. Great advice, thanks chef. To top it all off we had two perfect coffees followed by a gin and tonic each. All this for around 90 euros. You won't find better value in Madrid. And that is saying something. Throughout our meal we had attentive but unobtrusive service from the waiter. The chef-owner (?) whose name I omitted to ask checked on our satisfaction on at least a couple of occasions and talked happily about his creations when prompted. No prompting needed to recommend this stellar restaurant, without reservation. Just don't forget to make a reservation.",2014-04-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or260-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_581,0.045,0.764,0.191,0.9995,0.279031219325337,0.5390691362014891,0.4670696969696969,5132,428,0.083398285268901,1,137,False,131,0.1188118811881188,0.1336633663366336,0.3366336633663366,0.0693069306930693,0.1138613861386138,0.0297029702970297,0.0346534653465346,0.0148514851485148,0.1138613861386138,0.0346534653465346,897,506,4.720178372352286,0,0,love morn spent wander around barrio de la letra coupl week ago stumbl across charm restaur lunchtim disappoint learn fulli book end eat la vaca veronica coupl door road mistak ok meal owner offens rude deserv nobodi loyalti full review follow shortli howev gem left last favour impress look like place enjoy great meal precis today make reserv worth wait moratin vinoteca small welcom cosi underst space bookish look accentu well chosen print shelv line art book stylish bric brac flouresc tube offend eyebal light underplay tast must treat eat even judg previou review design element combin lend restaur wonder relax relax atmospher menu short long interest expect plate curl jamon slice dri tortilla menu full tantalis unusu wonder fresh price fair starter around euro main around euro adventur delight decid tempt starter chose two first remark tini juici artichok oliv oil sal de cecina cecina delici dri cure beef appreci throughout spain often serv aperitivo make sal salt grate artichok result exquisit brilliant surpris pair delic yet full flavour second starter mi cuit monkfish liver babi broad bean full subtleti tast mi cuit much restrain flavour goos duck liver need told fish blind test like previou dish blend less obviou contrast ingredi combin provid someth irresist alchemi main steak tartar may seem unadventur invent interest dish offer dish chosen best restaur cook disguis inferior qualiti success failur depend entir qualiti liter raw materi chef restraint skill combin meat ingredi produc sublim dish dish prepar kitchen front sometim happen showi restaur franc exampl serv coupl small piec toast provid crunch contrast succul meat also chose option slightli picant usual good choic good steak tartar ever eaten lot good raw meat beat get drift choos steak tartar restaur put well hand chef red meat egg need fresh eaten raw sever hour later write review safe report ill effect eaten dish lunchtim eat right oh produc uncontrol flow saliva whenev rememb eat like red meat wife chose canneloni carrillera veget carrillera pig cheek may sound unappetis uniniti one delici cut meat treat correctli mean cook slowli patient produc incred tender tasti meal tast vouch dish mouth water end meal superb chocol coulant fill spong perfectli judg sour cream distincti yoghurti choic dish call red although warm spring weather day ate meant fanci anyth heavi chef owner recommend bottl treintamil maravedi young blend grenach tempranillo syrah bodega maranon madrid region eleg aromat tast red fruit littl pepper smooth round perfect choic dish easi drink hard pocket either around euro great advic thank chef top two perfect coffe follow gin tonic around euro find better valu madrid say someth throughout meal attent unobtrus servic waiter chef owner whose name omit ask check satisfact least coupl occas talk happili creation prompt prompt need recommend stellar restaur without reserv forget make reserv,very good,5

Una luz c√°lida y tenue, una musica agradable, camareros atentos, cena exquisita y una bodega no muy extensa (por suerte) pero envidiable. Si todo esto lo unes a una buena compa√±√≠a ten por cuenta que la noche saldr√° redonda.  El restaurantes se compone de unas 10 mesas bien distribuidas con un servicio excepcional y con una carta escueta y excelentemente elaborada con calidad suprema. Nos decantamos por unos primeros ligeros Puerros confitados con salsa romescu (que se desacian en la boca) y alcachofas con sal de cecina (s√≠, yo tampoco cre√≠a que esto se podia hacer)...algo maravilloso para el paladar. Con los segundos quer√≠amos probar de todo, pero yo al final decid√≠ que con el Caliza que estabamos tomando se merec√≠a un steak tartar (lo cual no decepcion√≥ para nada). Me acompa√±ante en cambio tir√≥ al pescado, una merluza al caba en papillote que estaba justo en su punto. Para el postre algo sencillo, una creme brulee para compartir (r√≠quisima y casera) Volver√© porque me qued√© con ganas de probar el cochinillo que cuando lo vi salir a la mesa de al lado me dejo con unas ganas tremendas y tambi√©n para probar el coulant de chocolate. The night in the neighborhood of the letters of Madrid has its charm , but even if you go at night for dinner at this small restaurant. A soft warm light and a nice music , attentive waiters , fine dining and not extensive wine card (thankfully) but enviable . If all this join it with a good company, the night will be perfect. The restaurant is made up of about 10 tables well spread with exceptional service and a brief letter and excellently made ‚Äã‚Äãwith supreme quality. We opted for first light dishes, Leeks confit with romesco sauce (soft on the palate) and artichokes with salt of cecina (yes, I also thought that this could be done) ... something wonderful for the mouth. With the seconds dishes I wanted to try them all , but I finally decided to try the steak tartare (which did not disappoint at all) . My companion, opted for the hake in the caba in foil that was made right in your point For dessert, something simple, a creme brulee to share (rich and homemade ) Back because I was eager to try the suckling pig when I saw him go to the next table left me with an overwhelming desire and also to try the chocolate Coulant .",2013-11-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or260-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_600,0.007,0.86,0.134,0.9965,0.3164462081128747,0.5830687830687831,0.2086285714285714,2425,203,0.0837113402061855,0,59,False,48,0.1639344262295081,0.1639344262295081,0.2786885245901639,0.081967213114754,0.1639344262295081,0.0163934426229508,0.0491803278688524,0.0,0.0491803278688524,0.0327868852459016,439,288,4.523917995444191,0,0,la noch en el barrio de la letra de madrid tien su encanto pero aun si entra por la noch para cenar en est pequ restaurant una luz c lida tenu una musica agrad camarero atento cena exquisita una bodega muy extensa por suert pero envidi si todo esto lo une una buena compa ten por cuenta que la noch saldr redonda el restaurant se compon de una mesa bien distribuida con un servicio excepcion con una carta escueta excelentement elaborada con calidad suprema no decantamo por uno primero ligero puerro confitado con salsa romescu que se desacian en la boca alcachofa con sal de cecina yo tampoco cre que esto se podia hacer algo maravilloso para el paladar con lo segundo quer amo probar de todo pero yo al final decid que con el caliza que estabamo tomando se merec un steak tartar lo cual decepcion para nada acompa ant en cambio tir al pescado una merluza al caba en papillot que estaba justo en su punto para el postr algo sencillo una creme brule para compartir r quisima casera volver porqu qu con gana de probar el cochinillo que cuando lo vi salir la mesa de al lado dejo con una gana tremenda tambi n para probar el coulant de chocol night neighborhood letter madrid charm even go night dinner small restaur soft warm light nice music attent waiter fine dine extens wine card thank enviabl join good compani night perfect restaur made tabl well spread except servic brief letter excel made suprem qualiti opt first light dish leek confit romesco sauc soft palat artichok salt cecina ye also thought could done someth wonder mouth second dish want tri final decid tri steak tartar disappoint companion opt hake caba foil made right point dessert someth simpl creme brule share rich homemad back eager tri suckl pig saw go next tabl left overwhelm desir also tri chocol coulant,very good,5

The restaurant itself is smallish and unlike some places they don't have a tapas area or outdoor seating. Tables are nicely spaced such that you don't feel as though people are sitting on top of each other.  The staff was very friendly and spoke excellent English. When I asked them how large the portions were they said they were full plates, but also said that they could do half-portions of many of the dishes if I wanted try multiple things. They suggested several of their specials and explained why the specials were recommended. We choose Artichoke as the first dish, Octopus as the second and beef tartar for the main. The artichoke was the first of the season and was prepared very nicely with a light seasoning. For a half portion it was relatively large. The Octopus was by far the best I've ever had and I've had good octopus - they have some method of vacuum cooking for it that makes it tender all the way through without getting rubbery. Perfectly seasoned. The beef tartar was billed as one of the restaurants specialties and I enjoyed it very much. When I asked about wine for the dinner, they offered a pairing with half-glasses for each course. Started with a medium dry sherry with the Artichoke, a slightly sweeter Galician white for the octopus and a more robust red with the beef tartar. I then asked them for a glass of their favorite full-bodied red reserve which turned out to be quite delicious. A small dessert of cr√®me Catalan topped the whole thing off. All that and it was less than 50 Euros for the whole thing which I thought was outstanding considering the quality and what I had. This is going to be my #1 favorite small place in Madrid. (And I've eaten at several of the Michelin starred restaurants, all of which were also wonderful but cost more than 10x as much.)

The wait staff were very friendly, attentive and gave us good suggestions on what to order. However as the restaurant's fully packed with customers, they became a bit overwhelmed though they had already been working in a really fast pace. The meal started with a Salmorejo-like amuse bouche and olives, which were the best I have ever had. The food we ordered, in generous portion, was great. Caldero de Arroz (rice in Cauldron with red prawns) for 2 was actually enough for 4. We, 3 ladies, could hardly finish it. Though too salty for our liking, we could tell tonnes of flavour of the sea were packed in it. All other dishes we ordered like the steak, the Galician-style octopus, smoked sardines and the salad were good. The oysters weren't as good though coz they're not in season. We had ordered too much and had to pass the dessert. The meal costs ‚Ç¨125, which was reasonable. But the overall experience wasn't perfect, it took us a really long time to get the crazily busy wait staff to give us the check. It did tarnish our impression of the restaurant band that's why it's rated 4 instead of 5. Though I wonder if it's worth the detour to go there, I must admit that it's absolutely a popular dining place that offered high-quality food for locals and tourists alike.",2019-09-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d15364769-Reviews-or30-La_Gaditana_Castellana-Madrid.html,UID_608,0.034,0.844,0.123,0.95,0.341468253968254,0.4880952380952382,0.4988428571428571,1351,106,0.078460399703923,0,42,False,67,0.1578947368421052,0.175438596491228,0.2807017543859649,0.0526315789473684,0.1929824561403508,0.0,0.0350877192982456,0.0,0.0701754385964912,0.0350877192982456,243,165,4.563786008230453,0,0,got reserv almost first parti seat wait staff friendli attent gave us good suggest order howev restaur fulli pack custom becam bit overwhelm though alreadi work realli fast pace meal start salmorejo like amus bouch oliv best ever food order gener portion great caldero de arroz rice cauldron red prawn actual enough ladi could hardli finish though salti like could tell tonn flavour sea pack dish order like steak galician style octopu smoke sardin salad good oyster good though coz season order much pass dessert meal cost reason overal experi perfect took us realli long time get crazili busi wait staff give us check tarnish impress restaur band rate instead though wonder worth detour go must admit absolut popular dine place offer high qualiti food local tourist alik,very good,5

We agreed to the dish and asked how much this would cost. We were told that they needed to weigh the fish before they could give us a price and then we were told 39 Euros per Kilo. This is way overpriced for Sea Bass. The meal also came with boiled potatoes and a simple salad. The bottles of water were close to 4 Euros each and of course, we were charged a sitting fee. The fish was prepared as a two-sided filet with the thinner ends being cooked properly and the middle, thicker section needing to be cooked more. The service was excellent and very attentive to our needs but overall the meal was overpriced and we left not feeling great about the experience.

I had mentioned off hand that it was my wife's birthday, when she went to powder her nose, the manager came to ask me her name and flashed a very cute little graphic around the restaurant's screens wishing her a happy birthday. While kitsch, it was done in such a cute and unassuming way that it was a great success. The food was good, the batter and oil were fresh.

We started with a green salad with goat cheese, shrimp croquettes, and asparagus in filo dough. Then we each had an excellent fish dish. We closed things out with their extraordinary dessert, baked apple topped with toffee foam (it‚Äôs big enough to share but you‚Äôll want it all).

The food was outstanding, from the vegetable pate that started our meal to the two desserts that ended it, as was the wine (don't even think about drinking anything other than Rioja).  We had the tasting menu, and because I dawdled in writing this review, I don't remember every course. The highlights were the croquetas (de carabineros - feather light but amazingly, intensely shrimpy) and the fish course (cabracho, a kind of rockfish - and Isabel, if you're reading this, si, tenemos algo parecido en nuestro lado del Atlantico, pero la gente aqui no lo aprecia y por supuesto, no sabe cocinarlo como Pilar!).  As good as the food was - and it was VERY good - the really special thing about this restaurant are the two sisters who run it and imbue it with their personalities. Isabel, the front of the house, explains the menu and isn't afraid to be a little bossy if she sees you about to do something that's going to detract from your experience (like not drinking Rioja, or eating the intense dark chocolate dessert before the apple toffee one). Pilar, the cook, comes out of the kitchen toward the end of the evening (dinner is a leisurely, one-seating affair) to make the rounds and chat with her guests.  Because that's really how Isabel and Pilar make you feel - like guests at their dinner party.",2019-11-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991733-Reviews-or10-Restaurante_Algarabia-Madrid.html,UID_649,0.021,0.872,0.107,0.9729,0.2636428571428572,0.6578730158730158,0.6411857142857142,1381,119,0.0861694424330195,1,49,False,40,0.074074074074074,0.2037037037037037,0.2777777777777778,0.074074074074074,0.1481481481481481,0.037037037037037,0.0185185185185185,0.037037037037037,0.1111111111111111,0.0185185185185185,247,177,4.582995951417004,0,0,chose spend last night madrid happi food outstand veget pate start meal two dessert end wine even think drink anyth rioja tast menu dawdl write review rememb everi cours highlight croqueta de carabinero feather light amazingli intens shrimpi fish cours cabracho kind rockfish isabel read si tenemo algo parecido en nuestro lado del atlantico pero la gent aqui lo aprecia por supuesto sabe cocinarlo como pilar good food good realli special thing restaur two sister run imbu person isabel front hous explain menu afraid littl bossi see someth go detract experi like drink rioja eat intens dark chocol dessert appl toffe one pilar cook come kitchen toward end even dinner leisur one seat affair make round chat guest realli isabel pilar make feel like guest dinner parti,very good,5

The food and house wine make for a very pleasant combination of flavors. First was a complementary pate of duck, pork and chicken combined with their crisp and warm bread slices. Perfect. Then we started with the croquettes which come 6 to a portion. 2-4 people can share this rich starter. Very tasty!! On to the main course. We had the oxtail which is a large portion as was the brazed pork medallions. Each was really large enough for two. Perfectly cooked. The house red is delicious and paired perfectly. Finally dessert of poached pears in wine with mascarpone. Isabel and Pilar joined at the end for pictures. The restaurant seats maybe 16. Reservation are really needed. They open at 9:30pm.

We came at lunch time without a reservation and were immediately seated. The customer service here was impeccable from both waiters (waiter/ma√Ætre) that we interacted with. We were walked through the menu, given suggestions, etc, all in a very friendly manner. The food was, on the whole, decent. My girlfriend had a tomato soup (good), and their cod (very good, although the vegetables it came with were cooked to death). I had a leek starter (disappointing) and the veal cheek cannelloni (average). The Catalan cream dessert was sad (though in fairness, it will always pale in comparison to the cr√®me br√ªl√©e, regardless of the restaurant). Overall, this restaurant makes for a decent stop for lunch or (presumably) dinner, but you should adjust your expectations going in. The food is unlikely to blow your mind.

I was blown away by the quality of the food and service. I made reservations in advance per all of the reviews here. Marcos gracioulsy put up with my bad Spanish; he and other staff speak English very well. When we arrived we were greeted with warm and enthusiasm. The establishment is very small, maybe 8-10 tables, if that---hence the reason why you must make reservations. I was surprised that Marcos handles the bookings, is also the chef, AND he comes to each table to explain the menu and make recommendations! Since this was our first proper meal in Madrid, we splurged. We ordered the soup, the salmon, the porcini mushrooms, the veal cheek cannelloni and the cod. Each bite was heaven. I really recommend the salmon, it's marinated for three days in salt and sugar, served cold with a delicious green sauce. My husband's veal cheek was out of this world, and my cod was perfection.  Our waitress was outstanding. She made recommendations for wine. We love wine, but are not savvy. We described what we drink usually, and she brought two samples. both were amazing. We also enjoyed several glasses of cava. I was thrilled to talk to Marcos about the amazing cauliflower cream served with the porcini mushrooms.  I loved that dinner was unhurried and relaxed. The prices were very reasonable--cheap, in fact, for the high quality of the meal and service.

Our host, fluent in English, took great care to describe each and every item on the menu and answered all our questions.  After enjoying an aperitif we treated to their Puerros confitados con romesco, delightfully tender leaks in a wonderful sauce. Our competent server, Olivia, brought a complimentary sampling of their marinated salmon of the the highest sashimi grade. Awesome! At the suggestion of our host we delayed having a second small plate of rich porcini mushrooms until after our main. The steak tartare was absolutely perfect with a slightly spicy blend of ingredients - the best I had ever enjoyed. My wife chose the fish special of the day, a tender, moist sea bass which was flavorful and blessed with a tasty sauce. Moratin Vinoteca offers an expansive wine list with many selections available by the glass. The service was absolutely perfect and the ambiance comfortable and relaxed. A really fantastic experience!

It was cold and windy when we arrived for an early dinner, by Madrid standards, at 10:00 PM due to our early flight the next day. Having just opened, the door was still locked and the very elegant and stylish Isabel greeted us and ushered us into the softly lit and romantic dining room of a beautiful old house resplendent with candlelight and soft music. Isabel is the Spanish version of Antie Mame, she's witty and charming and just slightly mad in the most delicious way ... we knew it was to be a special evening right away! We started with a perfectly chilled glass of Cava and enjoyed the house pate and delicious bread while browsing the menu. Isabel explained the menu in her inimitable style keeping us both laughing, and she is fiercely proud of the Rioja region and it's wonderful food. We both choose the Degustacion menu and were impressed with not only the quality of the food but also by the expert and beautiful presentation. We went with the house Rioja that's bottled specially for Algarabia and it was perfect with our meal, dry and medium body but rich and aromatic as is typical of Riojas. The evening was a whirl of great food and wine and conversation and more wine and all presided over by Isabel while Pilar performed her magic in the kitchen. The crispy asparagus was incredible as were the croquettes, and Spain is known for it's croquettes. What was supposed to be an early evening turned into a late evening as the equally charming and beautiful Pilar joined us and before long we felt like long lost friends. Madrid is one of our favorite cities and now Algarabia is our favorite restaurant in Madrid. Algarabia is a must for anyone that appreciates local cuisine and values service and attention to detail and at a very affordable price. It was not just a wonderful meal but also about making friends and memories!

There's only seating for 28-32 so your chances of getting a walk in table are virtually nil. They are also closed Sunday and Monday While small in size they have kept their diners comfort in mind by not squeezing tables everywhere. The tasteful artwork on the wall is thoughtfully displayed and you truly feel as if you're dining in someone's home. Our party of four began our meal with some delicious apertifs including a dry Cava and a yummy vermouth. Pours throughout the evening were generous and the small staff of three were welcoming, gracious and competent. English was spoken with varying degrees of fluency but language proved to be no barrier as their good will and desire to make their customers happy seemed paramount. To begin, a complimentary platter of potatoes and a small basket of toothy olive bread - the first hint that we were in for a special dinner. Appetizers included a warm tomato soup that was declared the best tomato soup ever made anywhere. Leek confit, cooked so well it tasted more like white asparagus, with no bitterness at all and an in-house cured salmon. A mid course of super savory mushrooms over a cauliflower puree was sublime.

It pains me to write this review, as I had SUPER high hopes for this place based on the incredible reviews on Tripadvisor. I know it is 2 sisters running it and I commend them on their efforts and wish them success, but this place was not for me. I thought for sure this place would blow me away and would become part of my regular rotation on trips to Madrid. I went with my friend and mother during a recent trip. We made reservations for the first slot of the evening and showed up about 10 minutes early. The lady who runs the front of the house made a little joke about it not quite being the time yet, but sat us. The d√©cor of the room is odd, to say the least. It is like sitting in someone's living room, except that someone is your 95 year old grandmother and she has been collecting bric a brac for years. There were strange pictures on the wall that did not fit, and it seemed like a cramped old house. I ordered the rabbit pasta, which was terrible. It had slivers of bone in every other bite, which made it very difficult and not enjoyable to eat. The wrapped and friend asparagus were salty and greasy and not that impressive. My mother had the mushroom soup, and found it to salty for her. When the lady came by and noticed she had not eaten it, she asked if there was an issue, and my mother told her it was too salty for her, to which the hostess replied, that lady over there is eating it, and it is excellent, it isn't too salty. Not exactly the kind of response I want, especially when we don't even complain without you asking. Don't ask if you don't want to know. On the positive note, my mother had a tuna entr√©e which she said was actually very good. I forget what my friend had, but I recall he was not pleased, and overall, the meal was eminently forgettable. We also had some shrimp croquetas, which were mediocre at best (go the Guadarrama to La Chimenea for croquetas). After all, I did not even order dessert, which is spain is a sin for me. The meal was very pricey and the food was just not good. I am baffled at the reviews here. Overall, service was decent and polite, if not the most agreeable, the food was not good and overpriced and the d√©cor was cramped and offputting. For that kind of money, hell, for even less money, there is WAY better food to be had all over Madrid.",2014-03-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991733-Reviews-or310-Restaurante_Algarabia-Madrid.html,UID_705,0.098,0.782,0.12,0.9069,0.1137247474747474,0.522371424871425,0.4815958333333333,2339,244,0.1043180846515604,0,62,False,69,0.1,0.1615384615384615,0.2230769230769231,0.0461538461538461,0.1538461538461538,0.0538461538461538,0.0384615384615384,0.0307692307692307,0.123076923076923,0.0692307692307692,451,248,4.188470066518847,0,0,ok let start pain write review super high hope place base incred review tripadvisor know sister run commend effort wish success place thought sure place would blow away would becom part regular rotat trip madrid went friend mother recent trip made reserv first slot even show minut earli ladi run front hous made littl joke quit time yet sat us cor room odd say least like sit someon live room except someon year old grandmoth collect bric brac year strang pictur wall fit seem like cramp old hous order rabbit pasta terribl sliver bone everi bite made difficult enjoy eat wrap friend asparagu salti greasi impress mother mushroom soup found salti ladi came notic eaten ask issu mother told salti hostess repli ladi eat excel salti exactli kind respons want especi even complain without ask ask want know posit note mother tuna entr e said actual good forget friend recal pleas overal meal emin forgett also shrimp croqueta mediocr best go guadarrama la chimenea croqueta even order dessert spain sin meal pricey food good baffl review overal servic decent polit agreeabl food good overpr cor cramp offput kind money hell even less money way better food madrid,very good,5

The total experience is very nice. The dining room is a bit dark (my daughter said it was like a funeral parlor), but we thought it was very romantic. The place was full and very small.

Our booking was done by email & they had remembered that my daughter was "" gluten free"" & when the bread arrived they brought rice cakes instead - we were very impressed.

We were warmly greeted upon arrival at 2200 with a hug and a kiss by our exuberant hostess Isabel. The charming salon is warmly lit and very inviting, the tables spaced to allow for intimate and romantic dining. The tantalizing aromas wafting from Chef Pilar's kitchen further set the mood as we were very hungry after a long day's night of travel. Feeling adventuresome after an icy cold glass of Cava we opted to let Chef Pilar surprise us with some of her off menu specials of the evening, and the David Moreno house Rioja. We began our journey thu Rioja with salmon mousse served in martini glass and topped with a luscious watercress cream. Next wonderfully fresh seasonal artichokes sauteed with Iberic ham. Then light as air lentils and foie gras, oh my! What followed next was a totally unexpected regional and seasonal Rioja dish of borrajas, similar to a very tender kale, sauteed with angulas which resemble tiny and delicate chanterelles and river crayfish.. stunningly simple yet amazingly satisfying. The finale was our favorite protein other foie, Iberian pork cheeks in a seductive Jerez sauce. Altough all our courses were plated to share we felt compelled to waive the white flag at this point and almost decided to forgo dessert, that is until Isabel brought us pears cooked in Rioja served with a mascarpone sauce. Dessert of course led to expreso's and then of course agua ardiente.. By now it was 0130 and we needed to stagger back to our hotel to recuperate. As we were the last guests that evening Chef Pilar and Isabel both escorted us out but not before more warm hugs and a kisses.. Thank for such an enchanting and sumptuous evening!

There are always people around to create a certain din in the room. This restaurant is tiny with less than 20 seats and doesn't have an accompanying bar scene, so it's a very different atmosphere from the usual Madrilean, city-center establishment. Not that it's dead quiet! The waitress (who is also the owner, along with her sister - the chef), is quite chatty but in a great way if you like characters that will converse on any subject and that are genuinely curious about their patrons opinions and experiences. People that like to stick to talking to their dining partners only will not appreciate this aspect of the visit here. Our opinion: if you've spent your trip with the same person you're dining with, you probably can use a conversation with someone else. Food is based on cuisine from Rioja, their native region. On the saucier side than most regional dishes, which is great for dipping their bottomless basket of bread. Standout dishes were: their signature asparagus, which was simple and perfectly cooked; the housemade pate; their Riojan snails in sauce; and the shrimp croquettes, which are not for people who prefer frozen, tasteless shrimp because these taste like they came out of the sea. For the price, their house wine from Rioja is perfectly acceptable. Allot a couple of hours to enjoy the various courses.

The Bistrot is small about 10 tables and decorated with contemporary art. The staff were spot on. The maitre d was simply the best, arriving at our table to pour wine exactly at the right moment, clearing dishes, taking orders etc. The chef Gil came out to talk to us to recommend a local Madrid wine to go with our meal and explain the menu. I asked if he did a taster menu and he said not but to order 2 dishes and share between the four of us. Do we did this 3 times. We started with leeks with a sauce on the side and marinated salmon with pickled vegetables. The salmon was so fresh it melted. We followed with a portion of cod and a portion of hake cooked in paper. The cod was good but the hake was exceptional. The next course was veal cheek stuffed pasta and chicken thighs in a sauce. Gil told us that the chicken thighs came from a chicken that originated in Essex. The recipe was his Grandmothers chicken recipe which he had tweeked slightly, so very tasty. The next course was chocolate fondant to die for with creme fraiche, bliss! We finished with a coffee and white port.

It's a very small restaurant so booking ahead for dinner is a must. Whilst we were there so many people who hadn't booked were disappointed. The owner of the restaurant is charming and his love of food is infectious. He spends a lot of time at each table discussing the menu and wines. We chose the tasting menu but even then the scope to leave out some or order as you go along is unusual but a great idea. We skipped lunch anticipating our dinner here and were so glad we did. We tried everything! The chef suggested we shared some dishes as we told him we wanted to try it all. The wines were magnificent and complemented the food. Desserts and coffees and digestifs were all delicious. I can't praise this restaurant or the staff highly enough. It had been three years since our last visit to Madrid but I may just jump on a plane to enjoy this restaurant again.

It's elevated home cooking, nothing too fancy but great food. The restaurant has the look and feel of eating at your grandmother's home. Isabel runs the front of house and her sister Pilar is the chef. That sentence is deceiving, they are the only people working there and they do everything. The sisters are from the Rioja region (the best food in Spain) and they make great food from their childhood. They even had wine bottled for their restaurant, I think it was from their family vineyard. Isabel's English and our Spanish was lacking but once we got her talking we had a lot of fun. This was a perfect way to end our trip and definitely one of our favorite meals. In regards to the negative reviews. Think of this restaurant like going to your grandmothers for dinner. You would not show up last minute with five friends and expect your grandmother to prepare a Thanksgiving type meal. They are just two people so book well in advance so they can shop and prepare.

From such practicalities are dreams made. Warmly greeted, we were given a thorough run through the menu before being served a wonderful meal, a cracking bottle of Crianza, and enjoying some of the best customer service we've ever experienced. From start to finish we were made to feel both welcome and at home in this cosy, quirky setting just off the Opera, and I couldn't recommend Algarabia too highly. I've been to many restaurants on my travels over the years, and I can honestly say that this was an exceptionally pleasant experience. We were tempted to order a second bottle of wine so we could linger another while (yep, we're Irish), but failing to do so is my only regret when I reflect on our meal at Algarabia. Every best wish to the two wonderful ladies who make this restaurant a true labour of love and a diner's delight. Oh, and I think I can still taste the glorious pate.

A pleasant environment and nice enough food were spoiled by the most astonishing rudeness of the staff - we were not sure what we had done to offend ... or if this was the regular standard of service. There were plenty of staff on hand, but difficult to get anyone's attention, and their manner came across as pretentious, rude, and cold - very different from what we had encountered elsewhere in Spain and Portugal. It seemed to us that we were not welcome in this restaurant.  In addition, a small aperitif, which we did not order, was delivered to the table at the same time as the food we had ordered. We were charged for the aperitif. This is a low tourist rip off more usually perpetrated by the less salubrious type of establishment. Very poor form for such an up market type of restaurant in the most popular shopping street in Madrid. The diner has the dilemma of not wanting to further spoil the experience by having an argument over a few euros, and not wanting to be difficult as you don't want to be a bad ambassador for other travellers.

Heard great things so I decided to go there last night with my wife. I didn‚Äôt make reservations and arrived around 0930pm and luckily there was a table available. Staff warmly greeted us and sat us in the back of the restaurant. This restaurant is fairly small so would recommend making a reservation as it filled up to capacity while we were eating. As mentioned from previous reviews the food has a Gallegean/Asian infused food per our waiter. I ordered a local craft beer from Northern Spain (awesome ) and we ordered a few appetizers. The stuffed tomato was delicious . They served it with the skinned peeled off and stuffed with an assorted mix of avocado and other greens . I can only describe it as if you love tomato‚Äôs get it you won‚Äôt be disappointed. The other appetizer which were the clams were flavorful as well. I wanted to grab mussels however we ate that previously. Lastly, we ordered the octopus dish which had so many good flavors with a hint of spice and the shredded beef dish inside of some light dough and cheese sauce. Great. Overall my experience here was great and I would definitely come back here again in the future .

We had not made prior reservations, but thanks to the hotel ME Reina Victoria, got us a table. It was nice that the restaurant was within a nice walking distance from our hotel as well.  On our first night, we arrived early and were seated at a nice table for two. We were greeted warmly and treated like VIP's throughout the evening. I must say that this bisro/vinoteca is very intimate and we found it charming. There are not that many tables, but we didn't ever feel rushed or crowded.  We ordered for our first dinner the free range chicken in an albarino sauce with potatoes as well as I ordered the ""dish of the day"", along with the ""soup of the day"" (I believe it was a tomato). Of course, we also ordered some really great wine by the glass. If I recall correctly, our server (could have been owner) indicated he usually sells it by the bottle. If you're lucky and it's in stock, you must try the Toro San Roman 2015 red wine, particularly if you enjoy a bold, dry red wine. I must also say the bread and sides were excellent as well. This is not fancy food, but just great comfort food. We also shared a wonderful plate of grilled vegetables, glass of champagne. On our last night five nights later, we were just so tired that we cancelled reservations at another restaurant called Arrayan and booked Moratin again. Nothing against Arrayan but it was just too far away for us and we were very tired. We definitely would rebook at Arrayan upon our next trip.. Anyway, back to Moratin. This time, we had some more great wine (Toro again and another wine), salmon with pickled vegetables, the same chicken we had our first night, etc. Everything was just as great as our first dining experience there.  Oh, and we would say that it was perhaps one of the best values for the money during our entire Spain/Portugal trip. Our total bill each night ranged between 64 and 74 euros (before gratuity). We would definitely go back. We highly recommend this restaurant. Before or after dinner, please give yourself time to dawdle down several of the streets between Santa Ana Plaza and Moratin. They are narrow, full of different types of shops, and made for pedestrians.",2019-02-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or30-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_810,0.023,0.738,0.239,0.9989,0.2134171907756814,0.5104192872117399,0.3902076923076923,2308,189,0.0818890814558059,0,69,False,118,0.125,0.1964285714285714,0.3214285714285714,0.0892857142857142,0.1785714285714285,0.0178571428571428,0.0,0.0357142857142857,0.0357142857142857,0.0,415,250,4.556626506024096,0,0,like said dine two differ occas within five day moratin recommend hotel concierg second day made prior reserv thank hotel reina victoria got us tabl nice restaur within nice walk distanc hotel well first night arriv earli seat nice tabl two greet warmli treat like vip throughout even must say bisro vinoteca intim found charm mani tabl ever feel rush crowd order first dinner free rang chicken albarino sauc potato well order dish day along soup day believ tomato cours also order realli great wine glass recal correctli server could owner indic usual sell bottl lucki stock must tri toro san roman red wine particularli enjoy bold dri red wine must also say bread side excel well fanci food great comfort food also share wonder plate grill veget glass champagn last night five night later tire cancel reserv anoth restaur call arrayan book moratin noth arrayan far away us tire definit would rebook arrayan upon next trip anyway back moratin time great wine toro anoth wine salmon pickl veget chicken first night etc everyth great first dine experi oh would say perhap one best valu money entir spain portug trip total bill night rang euro gratuiti would definit go back highli recommend restaur dinner pleas give time dawdl sever street santa ana plaza moratin narrow full differ type shop made pedestrian,very good,5

Fortunately the very kind waiter found us a place to sit near the bar and it was nice and comfortable. We ordered the tomato dish, grilled with guacamole, mango and kale. This was their signature dish and it is very safe to say that it is the best tomato I have ever eaten. Please try this if you get the chance.  My friends tried the mussels and pork knuckle and rated those dishes very well too. A special mention regarding the seafood Ceviche which was very delicious and very hearty.  But collectively we believe we have tried our favourite cheesecake of all time, which was delightfully served with a small jar of jam.  Would just like to thank the staff as well as they were fantastic and explained all the dishes to us, were very prompt and were overall very kind to us.

We walked in and the chef greeted us at 1:30pm to an empty restaurant with a clean, simple and modern interior. Warm lighting showcased the artwork and bookcases of literature with empty wine bottles dotted around. It felt relaxed and comfortable, I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. The menu had no more than a handful of dishes with both English and Spanish descriptions. The chef took time to explain each one to us which was lovely of him. We chose the tomato soup, the octopus, the artichokes, the hake fish and the veal cheek cannelloni. The chef took this into consideration and designed the courses with half and full portions so that we could try everything but not be too full. A refreshing approach as most restaurants just want to charge you maximum price for everything and won't care if you can't finish the food.  He also recommended two glasses of cava to start and let us try them before choosing which one. That was very nice of them. The tomato soup was velvety smooth. The accompanying bread well baked with a crispy crust and soft fluffy filling. The cheese sprinkled on top melted and made the dish very warming and delicious. The octopus was served on a bed of creamy smooth potato mash and drizzled with chorizo oil. Tender and full of flavour it was our favourite dish. The artichokes were served in delicious bite size pieces. Soft and creamy, they were decorated with a well paired salt beef sand that gave a little crunch and texture. Unusual and worth a try. The hake was accompanied by grilled asparagus from Peru. Well cooked and full of flavour it was the best part of the dish. We had a generous portion of fish which was well cut. Sadly it was far too salty and slightly overcooked. This was the only bad thing about the meal. The veal cheek cannelloni had a flavoursome beefy filling which had been booked with wine, mushrooms and onions. The bechamel sauce and pasta was light and just right with the crunchy cheesy crust on top making it taste like a high end Mac n cheese... That was kind of lovely hehe. A good end to the meal, we finished and had to rush off to the Real Madrid game but if we had time we would have stayed for dessert as no doubt it would have been delicious.  As we left, the chef came over to shake our hands and thank us. This attentiveness and genuine friendliness makes us want to return and we definitely will. Thank you and enjoy.",2016-02-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or210-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_850,0.042,0.765,0.193,0.9976,0.2222103870788081,0.562369813422445,0.4576344827586207,2544,213,0.0837264150943396,0,46,False,86,0.0957446808510638,0.1382978723404255,0.3191489361702128,0.0531914893617021,0.1808510638297872,0.0212765957446808,0.0425531914893617,0.0319148936170212,0.0425531914893617,0.0744680851063829,461,276,4.51409978308026,0,0,fianc book place surpris walk quiet call de moratin nearli miss unassum restaur entranc walk chef greet us pm empti restaur clean simpl modern interior warm light showcas artwork bookcas literatur empti wine bottl dot around felt relax comfort must admit pleasantli surpris menu hand dish english spanish descript chef took time explain one us love chose tomato soup octopu artichok hake fish veal cheek cannelloni chef took consider design cours half full portion could tri everyth full refresh approach restaur want charg maximum price everyth care finish food also recommend two glass cava start let us tri choos one nice tomato soup velveti smooth accompani bread well bake crispi crust soft fluffi fill chees sprinkl top melt made dish warm delici octopu serv bed creami smooth potato mash drizzl chorizo oil tender full flavour favourit dish artichok serv delici bite size piec soft creami decor well pair salt beef sand gave littl crunch textur unusu worth tri hake accompani grill asparagu peru well cook full flavour best part dish gener portion fish well cut sadli far salti slightli overcook bad thing meal veal cheek cannelloni flavoursom beefi fill book wine mushroom onion bechamel sauc pasta light right crunchi cheesi crust top make tast like high end mac n chees kind love hehe good end meal finish rush real madrid game time would stay dessert doubt would delici left chef came shake hand thank us attent genuin friendli make us want return definit thank enjoy,very good,5

We ordered 5 items and shared. The plates were just the right size and great for sharing. The Octopus is the best I have eaten - juicy and well cooked and not at all spongy.

It is a great joy to be greeted with such heartfelt warmth by Isabel and Pilar as our favorite table awaits us. There is always a new dish with ingredients from Rioja to be savored. First course was a wonderful salad of fava beans and artichokes from Rioja and the marvelous white asparagus topped with a poached egg and jamon iberico also from Rioja. Both were beautifully presented and paired wonderfully with the ice cold cava. I seem to always opt for The Rabo de Toro as no one does it like Pilar and my partner had the Chumarro pork, both perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth tender, and of course a bottle of the excellent David Moreno Rioja bottled especially for Algarabia. We had long journey from Lake Como, and were leaving for La Mancha early next day so did not get to enjoy our usual dessert, cafe and agua ardiente to properly finish our evening in true Rioja style. Nevertheless we had a grand evening with Las Chicas de Rioja and enjoyed meeting their other guests, as they always seem to attract such an eclectic and fascinating clientele. Bravo Chicas!

This is the place to experience the unique TripAdvisor members‚Äô club restaurant atmosphere, made possible by reserving a table online with the help of TripAdvisor. Geared towards international guests, this restaurant has the menu available in every foreign language and the waiter knows her languages. The menu itself mixes starters and main courses and needs explanation, but you are shielded from the awkward feeling of going local. In line with foreign restaurant policy, you are asked beforehand for any allergies. Very save dining in a nicely decorated small and not so busy restaurant. This two sister restaurant - the second is in the kitchen - offers Spanish and Mediterranean cuisine. We ordered in April 2017 ‚ÄúChumarro"" (lightly braised pork loin) with caramelised onions (‚Ç¨18) and cod (‚Ç¨18). Regarding the presentation of the cod, tomato sauce covering the large piece of cod is always suspicious. Why should any chef conceal the most important ingredient? The cod itself did not excite the taste buds. Well prepared without fine taste. The same for the Chumarro, presented with a small portion of grilled onions. Without asking additional onions were offered. Good anticipation from the sisters, but it did not improve the absent of fine taste.  The wine was a David Moreno, Rioja 2012, selected by the restaurant (‚Ç¨17). It tasted good but not a wine to be remembered. For dessert, we ordered crunchy chocolate and raspberry cake (‚Ç¨7). Very nice chocolate smell. The best dish of the whole diner and the second sister left the kitchen to receive our compliments for her cake. For newbies in international travel, Algarabia Restaurante shields you from going native with hard to decode menus and hand signalling with waiters. In addition, you have the opportunity to exchange you travel experiences with other TripAdvisor members. On the other hand, Algarabia Restaurante shield you from the finer Spanish cuisine, any inside into Spanish dining habits and an unforgettable local dining experience.",2017-05-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991733-Reviews-or130-Restaurante_Algarabia-Madrid.html,UID_879,0.039,0.806,0.155,0.9928,0.1644404761904761,0.3832142857142857,0.2970227272727272,2092,133,0.0635755258126195,0,54,False,59,0.1538461538461538,0.1076923076923077,0.2153846153846154,0.0615384615384615,0.1538461538461538,0.0615384615384615,0.0307692307692307,0.0307692307692307,0.1384615384615384,0.0461538461538461,332,212,5.301204819277109,0,0,n w like eat among tripadvisor member without local peopl place experi uniqu tripadvisor member club restaur atmospher made possibl reserv tabl onlin help tripadvisor gear toward intern guest restaur menu avail everi foreign languag waiter know languag menu mix starter main cours need explan shield awkward feel go local line foreign restaur polici ask beforehand allergi save dine nice decor small busi restaur two sister restaur second kitchen offer spanish mediterranean cuisin order april chumarro lightli brais pork loin caramelis onion cod regard present cod tomato sauc cover larg piec cod alway suspici chef conceal import ingredi cod excit tast bud well prepar without fine tast chumarro present small portion grill onion without ask addit onion offer good anticip sister improv absent fine tast wine david moreno rioja select restaur tast good wine rememb dessert order crunchi chocol raspberri cake nice chocol smell best dish whole diner second sister left kitchen receiv compliment cake newbi intern travel algarabia restaurant shield go nativ hard decod menu hand signal waiter addit opportun exchang travel experi tripadvisor member hand algarabia restaurant shield finer spanish cuisin insid spanish dine habit unforgett local dine experi,very good,5

We made a reservation and finally made it on our last night in Madrid. It's a wonderful cosy place with great food. The white asparagus starter was delicious and the pate they served with bread was very good. I was not very hungry that day as we had eaten a very late lunch. However, my husband did justice to the meal. The pork roast was wonderful. The place is run by two sisters, really warm and friendly and it's like eating at someone's home. Isabel showed us pictures that she clicked when she visited India. She seemed so excited and genuine. They only have a 5-6 tables so make a reservation. It's a must visit if you are in Madrid.

This restaurant is a real gem in Madrid! I was a solo traveler and happened to walk by and popped in for lunch. Since the restaurant was full, they seated me at the bar and I received such great attention from Pablo, one of the three friends that runs the place. I was made to feel welcomed and Pablo, though very busy engaged me, in great conversation. Such a welcoming thing to do for a solo traveler! Oh and the food... wonderful contemporary spins on Galician cuisine!

When it opened we were shown to the back room which seemed a little sparse and crowded. I wanted to order the Galician Seafood Cocktail but they were freshly out of that so I settled for the Galician Mussels. These were huge mussels in a Malaysian curry sauce and a real treat. My wife had the freshly made pie which turned out to be a tuna pie, not something we have had before but very tasty. I had the grilled Octopus for my main and my wife the pork knuckle which was served on a massive bed of noodles in a peanut and teryaki sauce, both were amazing.

They treat you as if you were a dinner guest in their home. We had the Chef Tasting menu which started with fresh p√¢t√© and toast, followed by cheese croquettes and baked asparagus wrapped in a thin slice of meat. It was a unique taste in that the asparagus was actually crunchy! Excellent! Our next course was a generous portion of fresh cod baked in a tomato sauce. Very juicy! The main course was four pieces of tender pork loin topped with carmelized onions that gave the meat a slight sweetness. Another winner! All of this was enjoyed with a very nice bottle of Rioja. Get their oldest vintage. It's well worth it! Dessert was a surprise by Pilar, the chef. It was a small cup of apple mousse paired with a flourless chocolate cake that had just a hint of raspberry.

Isabel and Pilar are the chef/owners and they were wonderful hosts. We had not reserved and the restaurant was quite busy, however Isabel was very accommodating and we were soon seated sipping a superb Basque red wine that complimented our meal. Each of the courses were delicious. On Isabel's recommendation we shared the meal family style so I was able to try most of the menu selections. Everything was wonderfully prepared and presented by Pilar. We had the asparagus wrapped in pastry, the stuffed tomatoes, croquetas (the best that I have ever had!) and the pork loin. For dessert the apples and cream made for a delicious finale. At the end of the meal Pilar came out to speak with us and talked about the regional influences she takes in her cooking.
