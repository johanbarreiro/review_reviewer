We were the only tourists in there and we were really well looked after by Louis & his team.  There is a good choice of food and we were advised about how much to order. The recommendations were all delicious and we were very full when we left. Particularly enjoyed the croquettes and scrambled egg dish.

However, I can say that I was happy that I inadvertently did. For this menu, you get two starters (zucchini salad and smoked salmon), two main dishes (ravioli and Iberian pork), two desserts (dark chocolate cake and torrija), paired with a wine or liqueur for each course. I have to say that the food was well prepared and portioned, and the wines of good quality. Definitely a good dining experience and well worth the EUR25 price. I will be recommending this place to my Madrileno friends to try out. Now, the bad. Compared to other smallish degustation menus that I have tried before, this menu is a set, and I mean a SET so there are no other options to choose from. If you have any dietary constraints (e.g., pork, nuts, alcohol), this menu may not be for you. And finally, the bizarre. Just before the dessert, I inquired about the ravioli, and was told it was the third dish I was served. I had to rack my brain to remember what the third dish was, and what I remembered was slices of meat on a bed of vegetable puree. However, the manager insisted that I was served ravioli so I asked to see what their ravioli looked like (just in case ravioli means something else in Spain). From what I was shown, I can categorically say that the third dish was not ravioli. I don’t eat a lot of pasta, but I would like to think I know a ravioli when I see one.

Our server was welcoming, and spoke excellent English. He even humored us as we tried to order some in Spanish. The food is served in stages, which the three of us shared. We started with guacamole and banana chips, followed by goat's cheese with basil and honey. We then moved on to seafood, with mussels in a tikka masala sauce and octopus. We ended with pork on skewers. Each dish was better than the last, and I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a bad thing on this menu. The meals weren't, strictly speaking, traditional Spanish dishes, but rather unique takes on classics. We ended with three different, delicious desserts: cheesecake, blackberries and white chocolate cream, and strawberries with vanilla sorbet and coca cola extract. They were all great. Some other thoughts: the food is delicious, but the portions aren't huge (especially if you're coming from the States). The desserts were fantastic, but a bit pricy (6 euros a piece). In hind sight, they were actually quite large, and we probably could have shared two.  Overall, our meal came to 68 euros, with all the above mentioned dishes, lots of bread (you'll want to use it to enjoy all your extra sauce), and a beer. Considering the quality of the food and service, we all felt this place was an excellent value.",2012-02-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or440-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_8508,0.025,0.762,0.213,0.9956,0.2630102040816327,0.4923894557823129,0.21508,1370,110,0.0802919708029197,0,53,False,58,0.0847457627118644,0.2542372881355932,0.3220338983050847,0.0338983050847457,0.1694915254237288,0.0169491525423728,0.0338983050847457,0.0169491525423728,0.0508474576271186,0.0169491525423728,237,165,4.780590717299578,0,0,know outsid place offer excel food server welcom spoke excel english even humor us tri order spanish food serv stage three us share start guacamol banana chip follow goat chees basil honey move seafood mussel tikka masala sauc octopu end pork skewer dish better last think hard press find bad thing menu meal strictli speak tradit spanish dish rather uniqu take classic end three differ delici dessert cheesecak blackberri white chocol cream strawberri vanilla sorbet coca cola extract great thought food delici portion huge especi come state dessert fantast bit prici euro piec hind sight actual quit larg probabl could share two overal meal came euro mention dish lot bread want use enjoy extra sauc beer consid qualiti food servic felt place excel valu,very good review,5,Spanish

THE best croquettas we had in Spain, crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, one type filled with a mushroom cream, the other with manchego. Also had a fried mussel tapa. These were bizarre but I liked them very much. Mussel shell filled with a mussel cream, then breaded and deep fried. We also had the black pudding that was wrapped in a crispy pastry shell, looked like the size of a pirouette cookie. Also had a rice dish with duck confit. It was really good, much better than Valencia paella. They had another rice dish with mushrooms and beans, but didn't see that one until after we ordered. The only dish that I would rate ""good"" but not great, was a tuna and roasted red peppers. The waiter thought I had ordered it, but we didn't == just a miscommunication in languages. He was so nice and we didn't want to offend him, so accepted it. I was expecting raw tuna, but it was cooked, which I am really not a fan of, however, the flavors paired really well. All dishes were plated creatively. I think reservations are essential. Very casual place, with a big screen TV that had soccer game playing which made the place more fun. Just two guys running the place, a bartender and the waiter. The bar tender was mixing what looked like killer drinks. Wine by the bottle and glass (nice pours and only 2.10E each!).

We had been vainly looking for another restaurant recommended by a friend but we gave up and opted for this as we liked the look of it.  So incredibly pleased we did! This place is a find.  We started off with complimentary black pudding parcels and egg salad crisps - they were delicious and an indication of the amazing food standard that was to come. We had beef and cheese croquettes, a beautifully dressed and plentiful salad, goats cheese, wrinkled potatoes. All the dishes were thoughtfully presented and excellently executed.  The desserts didn't disappoint either. We shared home made chocolate and caramel ice cream and a stand-out strawberry cheesecake. It's rare for cheesecake to leave a lasting impression, but this did! Every element of it was 100% on point. From the base to the creamyness/cheesiness factor and the fruit topping....even the sweetness. It really was impressive! The service. Again. Amazing. The waiter - I think he was the owner, helped us order and then we he could see we had perhaps over ordered cancelled our final dish without charge. He checked, unobtrusively, throughout our meal that everything was satisfactory and was just totally charming. I actually cannot wait to recommend this place to my friends. I can't wait to return.

The smells from the kitchen can be clearly heard in the sitting area which is somewhat annoying. Not many tables and not much space in between - in the evening becomes super loud. The food is average - eatable but not something you would come back for or think about the next day, and a bit pricey for 'nothing special'. We came in at 8pm and the waiter told us that we can be seated until 10pm as there was another reservation coming (which was totally fine for us), but then he started coming to our table to ask if we are finished starting from 9pm. The waiter helped us to choose the wine and proposed a bottle. We liked the wine a lot (thank you!) and asked for the second one, but there was no one left (seriously? in the beginning of the Friday evening?), and the second one recommended was not so good at all.

It's in a small side street so glad we looked it up as we wouldn't have just stumbled upon it! We arrived just after 8.30, we hadn't reserved but they had a table for 2. If you intend to arrive later than this probably best to book as the restaurant filled up quickly, mostly with bookings. Waiters were really friendly, I am a Spanish speaker but my friend isn't so when they realised I was translating for her they were more than happy to explain everything in excellent English. They advised us to share a couple of the smaller dishes to start and then have a main, either from the meat section or the rice section. We shared the goats cheese in honey and basil and the octopus with foamed potatoes. Both were absolutely fantastic and good sized portions. Definitely could have eaten them twice over! We then shared Fideua as a main which is like paella but instead of rice uses small noodles. This was also fantastic, a more than ample portion for two people and although we were both quite full we couldn't bring ourselves to leave any! We didn't have dessert, too full up, but we saw some people having the famed mojito sorbet and they said how good it was. We also had a couple of glasses of nice wine with our meal. Had we been staying longer in Madrid I'm certain we would have returned here to try some of the other things on the menu and I'd definitely return next time I'm in Madrid. Food was fantastic, Spanish but with a modern twist and very reasonably priced for the quality.",2017-04-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or80-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_8339,0.004,0.778,0.218,0.9978,0.2991211484593837,0.5174439775910366,0.3337285714285714,1607,156,0.0970752955818295,3,33,False,62,0.1836734693877551,0.1632653061224489,0.2857142857142857,0.0612244897959183,0.2040816326530612,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0,0.0612244897959183,0.0204081632653061,297,188,4.414141414141414,0,0,stay hotel near restaur flag search tripadvisor nearest one small side street glad look stumbl upon arriv reserv tabl intend arriv later probabl best book restaur fill quickli mostli book waiter realli friendli spanish speaker friend realis translat happi explain everyth excel english advis us share coupl smaller dish start main either meat section rice section share goat chees honey basil octopu foam potato absolut fantast good size portion definit could eaten twice share fideua main like paella instead rice use small noodl also fantast ampl portion two peopl although quit full bring leav dessert full saw peopl fame mojito sorbet said good also coupl glass nice wine meal stay longer madrid certain would return tri thing menu definit return next time madrid food fantast spanish modern twist reason price qualiti,very good review,5,Spanish

We decided to check this place out as it seemed like the type of restaurant we were looking for. Our server was so courteous and found us a place to sit even though the restaurant usually takes reservations. He then proceeded to ask us what language menu we would prefer. The menu offered a lot of vegetarian options which was great as some of us did not eat meat. While we waited for our drinks, he brought out a couple of hors d'oeuvres for us to share. The food did not take long between courses and always came out hot. After dessert, the server gave us a mini piña colada to wash everything down.

I was pretty excited to come here with my friends because I had read some great reviews but I would have enjoyed more of a variety of dishes. I ordered croquettes with beef and cheese and they were delicious! I was very pleased with presentation and taste. I also ordered the sautéed porcini mushrooms with crispy spinach which was really good as well. I was satisfied with the food and the service but I wish the place was a little bigger and the menu offered more. There were a lot of drinks to choose from but not many entree dishes or desserts. I had the caramel ice cream for dessert and fell in love, only bad part was it was a single scoop so if you do order this ask for an extra scoop! I had a great time here but it was definitely a place for an older group and I'm a college student so it didn't really wow me. I would come back just with a friend not a group.

We wanted to try authentic Spanish food, where locals may choose to eat. This is a small restaurant but when we arrived at 7.30 there were only two other tables occupied, the decor is simple but lovely. The waiters are attentive and try very hard to communicate in English, which was good as we know no Spanish. On arrival we were treated to an amuse bouche which was delightful and at the end of the meal we were given a dish of sweets - lovely! Where they thought we were over ordering they suggested we hold back which proved sensible, they advised on the menu successfully and we enjoyed all of our food. The small portion of patas bravas was enough for two as a started and completely delicious. My son had the salad filled with nuts and a lovely dressing, For main I had the hake, my partner had the monkfish with noodles and my son the croquettes. He also managed cheesecake which he assured us was fabulous. We rounded the meal off with Irish coffee which was perfect.

The food was innovative and delicious. We had the goat cheese salad which was one of the bestmI ever had. The mussels tikka masala were wonderful and the Iberian pork melted in our mouths. The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars was the neighborhood and the Formica table atmosphere. For foodies, a great find- any great restaurant would be proud to serve it!

The reviews were good so thought we would try turning up without a reservation and luckily there was a table free. The inside has cute and quirky decor, the staff were friendly and the food was amazing! We opted for the ‘full brunch’ which included either an orange juice, mimosa or cava, a tea or coffee, yoghurt with fruit and granola, selection of breads and croissants with jam etc then followed by a chose of various cooked elements - we opted for the brunch salad which had poached eggs, spinach, avocado and bacon. We were so full after all of that which cost €17 which we felt was a great price for such an amount of food including drinks. There was a smaller option which cost quite a bit less and then a menu which you can choose your own items from. So pleased we found this place thanks to tripadvisor!

We got the fried goat cheese with honey and basil oil, octopus with foamed potatoes, and the black rice paella. The goat cheese is served with bread and is so savory. My husband is not a fan of goat cheese, but he LOVED this dish. The honey and the basil oil made the sour taste that is associate with goat cheese disappear. Get this dish when you come here. The foamed potato and octopus was also very good. The octopus was so soft and not hard and rubbery. The dish kind of reminded me of the steamed eggs you get at Japanese restaurants. You can definitely taste the potato in the foam. It was very unique and delicious at the same time. The black rice paella was huge. We were so full after the paella. It takes 25 minute to make but it is worth the wait. It comes out super hot and there is shrimp, mussels, and clams in it. I recommend getting the paella and maybe 2 other dishes or just stick to all there other dishes so you can try more things and not get full from paella. We were STUFFED after our meal and could not finish the paella. The servers here are very attentive and can give you some recommendations if you are a visitor in Madrid. We called the day of to get a reservation for this restaurant because it is small and fills up really fast.

The food was good, the service was pleasant and efficient and the wine was fine. They have menus in English. Our impression was that Vinos de Bellota was run by a few youngish graduates who are destined to make a go of things. Based on the number of, mostly Spanish, people eating and drinking there they are succeeding. We made a reservation for the following night and found Vinos de Bellota even busier with people prepared to wait up to an hour for a table. The food was just as good but the service, although still very pleasant, was much less efficient.  We would strongly recommend Vinos de Bellota and would certainly choose to eat there again. One thing to watch though is that, for some reason, they put payments made by card through in your national currency not Euros. They really should ask first.",2013-11-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3530204-Reviews-or140-Vinos_de_Bellota-Madrid.html,UID_8595,0.0,0.824,0.176,0.9795,0.2991269841269841,0.4391534391534391,0.4125599999999999,964,78,0.0809128630705394,0,20,False,42,0.2033898305084746,0.1525423728813559,0.3050847457627119,0.0677966101694915,0.2033898305084746,0.0,0.0,0.0338983050847457,0.0338983050847457,0.0,174,126,4.540229885057471,0,0,made journey eat visit reina sofia c bu short walk base trip advisor review realli enjoy first meal food good servic pleasant effici wine fine menu english impress vino de bellota run youngish graduat destin make go thing base number mostli spanish peopl eat drink succeed made reserv follow night found vino de bellota even busier peopl prepar wait hour tabl food good servic although still pleasant much less effici would strongli recommend vino de bellota would certainli choos eat one thing watch though reason put payment made card nation currenc euro realli ask first,good review,4,Spanish

He is a chef as well, speaks great English, and explained his menu nicely. It is a creative menu of relatively simple foods but executed well. Goat cheese salad is a must -- my wife is still talking about the dressing. The guacamole is fresh, full of flavor and had me mopping up the last bits with my bread because the plantain chips were gone. My octopus (""pupo"") in a ""potato foam"" was absolutely outstanding. I'm thinking of going back again tomorrow. Asparagus done with parmasean and a light balsamic was simple, flavorful and delightful. The skewers of pork were perfectly spiced, succulent. The restaurant is a small, very casual place that might benefit from a touch more decorating. If you were to walk by and not know what was within you might not stop. But this would be your mistake. The food is great, the prices right, and the host very charming. His passion for the food is very obvious and it shows on the plates.

Simply put food phenomenal . . . service was great, and the ambiance was relaxed and local. We shared everything we had and probably ordered more than we should as everything sounded so good. We had the potatoes to start with the red pepper sauce which were simple and delicious. Then the goat cheese salad came out which was the best goat cheese I've ever had, warmed to perfection with a slightly crispy bottom layer with an amazing balsamic reduction that was the perfect blend of sweet with the vinegar. Then the Mussels with a tikka masala sauce that was a combination I never would have thought of and was again amazing. The asparagus with the same balsamic reduction and slightly melted finely shredded parmesan cheese was the best by far. Every bite just disintegrated in our mouth's and blew us away. At this point we were both pleasantly stuffed and thought we could handle no more. We had caught notice of one dessert at the table next to us that was intriguing. It was some sort of green gelato with rum poured on top. Our waiter then came up with perfect timing and explained that it was a mojito sorbet. It was just that only better than any mojitio I have ever had. We shared it as it we ate soo much it would have been impossible for us both to have our own. Our waiter recognized us as american and was very curious to hear where we were from and what we were doing in madrid. he made conversation and handled the small but busy resturant well and the food was timely but not rushed. definitely a visit that we will make again.",2012-04-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or420-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_8606,0.013,0.86,0.127,0.9811,0.2807894736842105,0.518577694235589,0.2012368421052631,1678,158,0.0941597139451728,0,24,False,57,0.18,0.18,0.26,0.08,0.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08,0.04,308,185,4.451298701298701,0,0,girlfriend look last minut place dinner reserv stumbl onto gastromaquia via trip advisor simpli put food phenomen servic great ambianc relax local share everyth probabl order everyth sound good potato start red pepper sauc simpl delici goat chees salad came best goat chees ever warm perfect slightli crispi bottom layer amaz balsam reduct perfect blend sweet vinegar mussel tikka masala sauc combin never would thought amaz asparagu balsam reduct slightli melt fine shred parmesan chees best far everi bite disintegr mouth blew us away point pleasantli stuf thought could handl caught notic one dessert tabl next us intrigu sort green gelato rum pour top waiter came perfect time explain mojito sorbet better mojitio ever share ate soo much would imposs us waiter recogn us american curiou hear madrid made convers handl small busi restur well food time rush definit visit make,very good review,5,Italian

I have now been to Gastromaquia twice and I can happily say that if I had more time in Madrid I know I would be back. The first time I went with my girlfriend and sisters and I can safely say we ordered nearly half of the menu. The types of dishes they make and the interesting twists they place on Spanish classics displays a true love for food and desire to provide a unique and interesting dinning experience. Add on top of that the helpful staff and fact that one of the two chefs is in charge of the dinning room, so he is always talking about the food and doing so with great English, and you have an incredible dinning experience that is accessible to anyone. Obviously most of the time you would expect to pay excessively for this type of food, but I can happily say that this meal left both our stomachs and wallets 100% satisfied!",2012-05-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or410-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_8607,0.006,0.844,0.15,0.9754,0.3634057971014492,0.5554347826086957,0.23626,938,94,0.1002132196162046,1,10,False,39,0.12,0.24,0.38,0.04,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,178,109,4.275280898876405,0,0,would found place without tripadvisor especi drawn write review gastromaquia twice happili say time madrid know would back first time went girlfriend sister safe say order nearli half menu type dish make interest twist place spanish classic display true love food desir provid uniqu interest din experi add top help staff fact one two chef charg din room alway talk food great english incred din experi access anyon obvious time would expect pay excess type food happili say meal left stomach wallet satisfi,good review,4,Spanish

The place was pretty much empty and they said they were out of food. Initially he, the host (also server) said that if we came back tomorrow, they would be able to do a better job of serving us. We didn't ask but I think he was also the chef. He was very chatty and I think that made the meal that much better. He had spent some time in NYC and spoke pretty English quite well. When told that this was our last night in Madrid, he said his food options were limited, as they had run out of most of their food. We said we would take whatever.  The starters were delicious, potatoes in an amazing local sauce and guacamole, and the local beer and wine were great as well. They were recommended by the host with significant discussion regarding sourcing the wine (which was pretty cheap BTW).  The rabbit was very good and the pork skewers were absolutely delicious. The chocolate dessert was awesome. I think the food was very good, we would have given it 4 stars based on just the food. Then again I would never have ordered guacamole in Spain when I live in California. Thats not to say it wasn't very good and given the slim pickings, the late night accomodation, I wish I could give them 6 stars. Overall for 1 beer, 1 wine and a bottle of water, 2 good sized appetizers and 2 main dishes as well as desert, the total was just under 50 euros.

Initially the restaurant was not really what we expected, as the bar is fairly dominant when one enters and it seems that this place is more renown for its drinks. But once the food is served, you know you are in the right place. We had a variety of starters, all excellently cooked. The foie gras with a gin sauce was the best I have ever tasted. The wine list is short, as is the menu, but the quality is perfect. The restaurant also boasts a long gin list and a very good homemade Gin Fizz shot. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. When the bill came, we were surprised about the low price. An absolutely excellent restaurant and do recommend to reserve a table.

All were fabulous, particularly the croquettas, still the best I've ever had. Other standouts included a mushroom and bean saute surrounded by crispy spinach, small potatoes that were halved, and topped with a sauce. They were different than potatoes bravas. The goat cheese was excellent, as was the pate with the gin and tonic jelly. Wine list was wonderful, but if you go, get a Gin and Tonic (Larios 12 anos) -- sensational. So good that with tastes from my glass, 4 others at the table ordered them! 7E each seemed to be comparable price in the USA, however, upon arrival they were 3x the size of a gin and tonic in the USA.

I mean, the kind of service that made us look at each other and say ""this would never happen in the states"". Our waiter was quick, kind, and knowledgeable about the dishes we wanted to try (mainly the paella). He spoke English, but engaged in our attempts to speak Spanish when we could. The paella is made from scratch, so it does take 25 minutes to arrive. In that time, he recommended we get a little something to munch on, but we told him we couldn't really afford to (we're students with very little money). Of course, when a plate of guacamole and plantains comes to our table, we became concerned and flagged him over to tell him we didn't order it. Do you want to know how he responded? ""We've all been young once."" The only problem is, I am now burdened with the task to pay it forward! What a genuinely kind gesture to two students looking for some good food. The food was more than that: it was delicious! We opted for Arroz Negro because neither of us had tried squid ink before. This would definitely be the place to try it out. The guacamole is different than what we have in the states, but it was a great appetizer before our HUGE dish of Arroz Negro arrived. We ate until we were full, and there was still more left. You are definitely getting at least your money's worth here. While paying, another waiter was really friendly, and talked to us about family he has in the states. He told us to hold on before leaving, and came back with two shots of Bailey's to send us on our way. This is the kind of restaurant that leaves both your stomach and your smile full. We will be back to enjoy it some more.

While I did enjoy the “surf and turf” paella that we had, it is my opinion that it could have been better. I found that (a) the chicken was cut into some small, unfamiliar pieces, (b) the seafood (shrimp, mussels and calamari) was somewhat over cooked and (c) it lacked the “socrito” (the crispy base that forms in the bottom of the pan) that good paella is known for. The rice and seasoning were very good. I suspect that the proteins were prepared separately and then added to each order resulting in them being over cooked and that the chicken pieces were cut small to facilitate quick cooking. I did notice the pan itself was well seasoned enough to allow for a socrito to form had there been less liquid in the pan and it had been allowed to cook just a bit longer. The earlier comment about the proteins being cooked separately and then assembled per order could have also contributed to the overall dish satisfaction. We did try some super outstanding eggplant chips that were drizzled with what was described on the menu as honey but was more resemblant of molasses. They were thin, flash fried morsels of deliciousness and worth a trip here for only those. We enjoyed a bottle of excellent rose wine that went well with both dishes. Our servers, Laura and Sheryl, were friendly and engaging. I also found prices to be very reasonable. Fun, hip and enjoyable food off a small street near the bustling Plaza del Sol.

However this restaurant we think is definitely over-rated from 2.5 -3 star to 4.5 star. The place is pretty small with out of date decoration. Very limited choices of food and drink - only one beer option. Several dishes appeared on the menu are only served in winter time. Food is very slow - we waited for over 1 hour for the main dish after they served our food one by one - and slowly. The first two dishes are salty and the beer glass is so small. Then we waited for ages for pur main dish which is a seafood fried noodle which we expect to be less salty. However, this dish was extremely salty - even saltier than the most salty Kebab I have ever had in an Austria kebab shop. We can't even finish 1/4 of the dish because of its poor tasting and pure salty taste. Things happens but the waiter charged the salty dish for 2 persons in checkout which apparently it didn't write as ""min 2 persons"" like some other dishes. We pointed this out and the waiter became less patient and showed bad mood - even they let us waited so long with very little customers at that time. and the salty food - little poor beer.

It’s on a tiny side street amongst many other small restaurants. First of all, the decor makes you bust out laughing. There are huge bunches of colorful paper flowers all over the walls, which gives it a tropical (maybe Hawaiian) theme - but not. Maybe “The Little Shop of Horrors” theme - but not. The menu seems straight up, but when the dishes come out, our mouths drop in surprise and laughter.  When the Burrata salad comes out, there’s a huge white eyeball thing on the plate. It’s the size of a softball. Then, the waitress, and all of them have a strong sense of humor - must be a prerequisite to be hired at this restaurant - pulls out a huge hypodermic needle and injects the white ball with liquid green pesto. Hmmm, that’s kinda different. The shredded pork is between two soft Chinese bao buns in a V shape. They’re Chinese shredded pork tacos - that’s what they are but we are in Madrid! They are nicely seasoned and very tasty.  They didn’t have the baby squid that was listed on the menu so they substitute it for beef. The grilled octopus is good but could have a bit more flavor.

Just like the previous reviewers have already said, it's a small, simple place and the main focus is on the food itself. Last summer I visited here 3 to 4 times and had different courses each time - everything was very tasty and I was rather disappointed that I wasn't able to taste everything during my summer break in Madrid! The best part is that the owner - who is such a nice and sincere guy - was kind enough to provide tips on how to cook the courses myself! It's in the middle of bustling Chueca and the atmosphere is best described as ""lively and loud"" - just like in all the best places in Madrid.

He recommend a lovely bottle of Ribera del Duero wine for us to enjoy our meal with. We had ensalladilla (a cold cream potato salad) as lovely to start with on the warm evening.

The flavors are the same as the classic preparation, but the opposing textures in Gastomaquia’s version leaves you wishing this was the version they were serving across Spain!

Travelling alone, I usually sit at a bar and chat to the staff and tonight was no different. I found the staff here, on my two visits, to be extremely friendly and engaging with time to answer my questions about their food, cocktails and wines.  The tapas served with every drink were exquisite, especially the savoury broth, which was most welcome, given the ambient temperature outside ( -1C ). In no time I felt at home, conversing with staff and locals alike.

I also thought its location would let us have a nice walk through the Retiro Park to and from the restaurant either side of a good lunch, and follow it up with free entry to the Reina Sofia (from 1330 on a Sunday) or the Prado (1700-1900) . To my relief, everybody loved it although we skipped the museums afterwards because it was great weather and we all wanted to walk lunch off a bit. We liked the look of the starters more than the mains and so ordered large starter portions to put in the middle to share which the waiter was happy to help us sort out. The food was delicious and arrived at intervals so we each tucked into the same dish. It worked really well because the oven baked rice, one of their specialities, takes a while to prepare and arrived last. All of the food was of a very good standard, with the steak, ""tigre"" mussels and cheesecake really standing out. The drinks as well were fantastic as the bar specializes in cocktails so some of us had a few to finish our meal off along with a shared desert.  It's a small, modest but very local place so we were the only tourists, which my sister liked. Service was good and we always had something to eat or drink, which my other sister liked. The wine and cocktails kept my parents happy while my wife liked the general ambience. We were all very happy with the food and I was very impressed with the value for money.

Because of the traffic patterns, we had to take a cab clear around Retiro Park, but Madrid cabs are not expensive. We arrived about 8:15, and of course most patrons were still outside sipping wine. We ate inside and found it had a very pleasant, relaxed atmosphere. The waiter was friendly and helpful, and there was an Englsh menu, although all the other patrons seemed to be locals.  I ordered a pork loin, and was asked how I wanted it cooked. Somewhat surprised, I said medium well done. Then I remembered that in Europe the way they feed hogs does not carry any danger of trichinosis, so I did not need to have it well done. When it arrived, it was slightly pink, and very moist and tender, better that the somewhat dry pork we eat here. It was quite a treat. Edith also was very pleased with her vegetable dish and house wine, while I had bottled water that was slightly more costly than the wine - a not uncommon event in European restaurants. The total tab, with tip, was less than 50 Euros, and that made this not only a fine meal, but a bargain also. This restaurant is highly recomended.

We had sangria, nachos to start then fajitas and risotto as mains. All very tasty however I have deducted 1 star as my fiancee placed the order while I was washing my hands. She said he seemed wowed that we ordered a large nachos as a starter but took the order anyway. The plate of nachos that came out wouldve been more suitable for 4 to 6 people to start them off. They were absolutely delicious but by the time our mains came out we were quite full and unable to finish our mains which I found disappointing as they were also tasty.

A smallish place with an almost family atmosphere and character, a purely Madrileno clientele (at least when we went, for lunch after a Sunday morning in Parque del Buen Retiro, itself not to be missed!) a welcoming, personable, smart and attentive waiter really good with advice about the food, including what would make enough of a meal - it was on his suggestion that we halved our order for the dish of boletus mushrooms and beans, one of the day's specials, that the two of us were going to share for a starter, and found he'd been absolutely right - and, most important, well-conceived and beautifully cooked food, stylishly served. My main course, of cod with tomatoes and hand-cooked chips with a pesto-like trailed across across the top, looked so much a work of art I felt almost reluctant to stick my knife and fork in it, and did so only after doing what I hardly ever do, take a picture, as attached. Snapped in low light it's unfortunately a bit fuzzy, but the dish was really delicious, as was my partner's food. When she and I asked to meet the chef so we could thank and congratulate him, he turned out to be a shy 21-year old, which made us all the keener to shake his hand, and wish him the best.

It’s the size of a softball. Then, the waitress, and all of them have a strong sense of humor - must be a prerequisite to be hired at this restaurant - pulls out a huge hypodermic needle and injects the white ball with liquid green pesto. Hmmm, that’s kinda different. Shredded pork: When this comes out, there are two soft Chinese bao buns in a V shape with shredded pork filling.

I’d prebooked lunch here for midday but due to it taking an hour to get from the airport to the restaurant we arrived 20 minutes late. Nevertheless the staff were welcoming and sat us at a table right at the front of the taverna. This place is very quirky and although the lunch menu was limited the food was delicious. We ordered the pork tenderloin, the Patatas wedges, mango chicken & ham croquettes. Due to the lack of choice we also order the surf & turf paella....and we definitely over did ourselves.  The food is incredible and the service is excellent. I can see why this restaurant is so highly rated and I’m so happy I chose to spend two hours of our 5 hours in Madrid in this lovely little gem of a taverna. On a side note, seating looks more comfortable downstairs although the decor isn’t quite as interesting.",2018-11-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7204621-Reviews-or500-Rosi_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_8787,0.031,0.713,0.257,0.9953,0.2959902597402598,0.6576623376623377,0.36725,912,74,0.0811403508771929,0,19,False,42,0.088235294117647,0.2058823529411764,0.2647058823529412,0.0588235294117647,0.1470588235294117,0.0294117647058823,0.0,0.0294117647058823,0.088235294117647,0.088235294117647,169,121,4.396449704142012,0,0,okay bit extrem best friend enjoy day trip london madrid prebook lunch midday due take hour get airport restaur arriv minut late nevertheless staff welcom sat us tabl right front taverna place quirki although lunch menu limit food delici order pork tenderloin patata wedg mango chicken ham croquett due lack choic also order surf turf paella definit food incred servic excel see restaur highli rate happi chose spend two hour hour madrid love littl gem taverna side note seat look comfort downstair although decor quit interest,very good review,5,Spanish

There is a smile and welcome from the barman as you enter. A waiter who is only too eager to please: none of the surly, hurried and harried and overworked standard Spanish waitstaff in sight. No “atmosphere “ and fighting for elbow room here. The tables are considerately spaced comfortably apart. And the food and drink and dessert are simply superb. Note that mixed drinks and dessert are not an afterthought here as in many Spanish restaurants:they were just wonderful!!!The wine list is well thought out and reasonably priced.

Our first surprise came when reading the menu, which was just one cheaply plastified page and did not have anything special or different listed in it. The menu lacked personality, with a couple of Venezuelan tapas but the rest of the menu were just ordinary dishes you could find anywhere and not identified with any type of cuisine (Latinamerican or otherwise). They did not have a wine list either, so we had to blindly choose what to drink. Also, the wine we finally had was O.K., but ended up being 20% costlier in the bill than what the waiter had told me when I asked. As for the food, we asked for different dishes to share. Instead of bringing all the dishes at once, they would bring every dish with a minimum 20 minute difference between them, forgot one of the dishes we had asked for and would only tell us that they had run out of one of the dishes after we had been awaiting for over 50 minutes. The food taste and presentation were only acceptable by minimum standards and no different from what anyone without training would be able to quickly cook during a lazy Sunday. On the good side, their staff was friendly (although rather distracted and very slow) and they offer a complimentary coffee cream liquor with the bill (too bad that we had spent over two hours there already when the bill came in and could not afford to stay more time to enjoy the complimentary drink). We may have had bad luck in terms of the food quality and negligent service, but the other things in this review are serious objective shortcomings showing that in no way can this restaurant be ranked among the best in Madrid (was listed fourth best when we visited it).",2016-12-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10786717-Reviews-or420-Cacao_Restobar-Madrid.html,UID_8813,0.067,0.811,0.123,0.974,0.1022380952380952,0.5497142857142856,0.2880777777777777,1762,159,0.090238365493757,0,31,False,65,0.1046511627906976,0.1627906976744186,0.2325581395348837,0.0697674418604651,0.1162790697674418,0.0581395348837209,0.0465116279069767,0.0348837209302325,0.127906976744186,0.0465116279069767,319,193,4.5266457680250785,0,0,live venezuela encourag visit venezuelan restaur rave review first surpris came read menu one cheapli plastifi page anyth special differ list menu lack person coupl venezuelan tapa rest menu ordinari dish could find anywher identifi type cuisin latinamerican otherwis wine list either blindli choos drink also wine final k end costlier bill waiter told ask food ask differ dish share instead bring dish would bring everi dish minimum minut differ forgot one dish ask would tell us run one dish await minut food tast present accept minimum standard differ anyon without train would abl quickli cook lazi sunday good side staff friendli although rather distract slow offer complimentari coffe cream liquor bill bad spent two hour alreadi bill came could afford stay time enjoy complimentari drink may bad luck term food qualiti neglig servic thing review seriou object shortcom show way restaur rank among best madrid list fourth best visit,bad review,2,Spanish

I stumbled across it by accident - I was browsing TripAdvisor after a visit to El Prado, looking for somewhere authentic that wouldn't be overrun with tourists. Cacao Restobar had very few reviews, so I figured it was a good bet. (Although I can see now they have tons of reviews! I think there were only about 8 when I went in early October.) I think I arrived in the restaurant at an odd time - it was only my second day in Spain, after all - because I was the only one there. The men who owned the restaurant were very friendly and the food was made from scratch and DELICIOUS. After I finished my meal, they began talking to me a bit and they told me they had only been in business for a few month. We talked for about 30 minutes and they told me about their plans for the restaurant and gave me a tour. They even complimented my Spanish, which I really appreciated! I told them I would come back in two weeks before leaving Spain, and as I walked by on my way to El Retiro, one of them saw me pass by and came outside to talk to me.

Cocido is essentially when lots of meat and vegetables are cooked together for a long time to make a big stock. The stock is separated and you get two meals: 1) Soup - with the stock and added fideos (a really thin noodle) - which is delicious 2) Everything else - they then bring out all the tender meats, chickpeas and lots of other vegetables (including cabbage/carrots/leek) It was a really hearty meal which I would say is the equivalent to an English roast - and we were super full! We also got a glass of Cava, croquettes and desert of our choice included in the price per person!

Fantastic service from people who truly care about your visit and appreciate your visit. Cocktails were authentic and delicious. Chris (professional bartender) created wonderful cocktails and Sangria utilizing fresh ingredients and infused liquors he makes himself. His passion really drives the bar portion of the restaurant. Although we tried the original cocktails he created, his knowledge could probably create a special cocktail on the spot for you. The food was also on point. We had the Arepas, Patocones, Nachos and Fajitas. I recommend all! Fresh ingredients that were well prepared and very addicting. We couldn't stop eating them and left no trace of food in the end. Finally, the atmosphere. It's not your typical Madrid cafe/restaurant. It's a great blend of modern decor with some rustic pieces. Very accommodating. My wife and I couldn't say enough about how much we enjoyed our visit. Planned to stay 1-1.5 hours, but stayed 3 hours and only left because we truly couldn't eat or drink anything else.

My partner and I were in Madrid for a week in October and went to Gastromaquia on our first night. It's very conveniently located in an up and coming and very gay neighborhood in Madrid. Do not be turned off by the plain exterior. The innovative tapas were the best we experienced during our trip and yes, the mussels were spectacular. We also experienced an amazing smoked salmon salad that was as beautiful as it was tasty. Be sure to save room for dessert ... the offerings are wonderful. The service was impeccable and the wine offerings were more value priced but delicious. We were prepared to use our Spanish translator installed on the phone but this was unnecessary since the owner described the menu in detail in English while at the same time explaining that was only a guide and that kitchen could work with us if we had something else in mind. Our only suggestion for improvement might be to lower the lighting level a bit.  We ate a several more upscale locations during the week and spent over twice the amount for far less inspired and in some case disappointing food. On our last day in Madrid we tired to return for a late lunch and were disappointed to find a change in hours that had the restaurant closed all day on Monday.",2012-11-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or370-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_8846,0.054,0.809,0.137,0.9547,0.2194327731092437,0.5998832866479927,0.3091818181818181,1353,131,0.0968218773096821,0,17,False,44,0.0847457627118644,0.1186440677966101,0.2542372881355932,0.0677966101694915,0.1864406779661017,0.0169491525423728,0.0169491525423728,0.0338983050847457,0.1186440677966101,0.1016949152542373,246,158,4.5,0,0,thank trip advisor submit review direct us terrif find partner madrid week octob went gastromaquia first night conveni locat come gay neighborhood madrid turn plain exterior innov tapa best experienc trip ye mussel spectacular also experienc amaz smoke salmon salad beauti tasti sure save room dessert offer wonder servic impecc wine offer valu price delici prepar use spanish translat instal phone unnecessari sinc owner describ menu detail english time explain guid kitchen could work us someth els mind suggest improv might lower light level bit ate sever upscal locat week spent twice amount far less inspir case disappoint food last day madrid tire return late lunch disappoint find chang hour restaur close day monday,very good review,5,Spanish

They only serve cocido, which is the typical dish of Madrid. It's a prix fixe of 29 Euros and it's all you can eat. When you arrive at this typically decorated restaurant, they seat you and immediately serve you a glass of Cava (Catalunya's answer to Champagne). Then they bring you delicious homemade rolls that you can dip into a plate of also delicious tomato sauce. This is followed by a chicken noodle soup that is brought to you in a clay pot, which keeps it hot. I can assure you that few of you have tasted a better chicken noodle soup. Then they bring the garbanzos - chickpeas along with boiled potatoes, cabbage, carrots and other goodies and on another plate chicken, tocino, chorizo, black pudding.

The staff are polite, friendly and helpful, but without being overbearing, and the decor is modern and tasteful. When we visited there was a really good acoustic Ibiza sessions soundtrack playing in the background which we really enjoyed. We chose to have mojitos, which are our favourite cocktails, and of which we consider ourselves a good judge having been drinking them for years in many different countries. We were thrilled to discover that the cocktails were lovingly and expertly prepared with fresh ingredients, plentiful alcohol and they tasted superb!  We had the house red wine with our meals, which was great too, and it didn’t stop there because the food was delicious too. The first time we visited was for or evening meal. My fiancé had a lovely king prawn risotto and I had a Mediterranean vegetable stack with goats cheese sauce, which although called something different to this, was explained well so I knew what to expect. Both dishes were served hot and fresh, and I was smiling the whole time I was eating it. We both had chocolate brownie with chocolate ice-cream for dessert which was not only generous in terms of the portion size, but also good on taste with a nice crispy shell housing soft decadent brownie within. Two mojitos, two glasses of red wine, two mains and two desserts set us back just €56.50 - incredible value for such a delicious meal. We were so impressed with our evening meal that the next day before we left Madrid, we couldn’t help but pop back to Cacao again to grab another couple of those fabulous mojitos. We also shared some nachos which were among the best we’ve had. This time the bill came to €25.90. We can’t recommend this fantastic restaurant enough! Despite the huge choice of places to eat in Madrid, if we go back there we shall return to Cacao for sure.",2018-05-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10786717-Reviews-or180-Cacao_Restobar-Madrid.html,UID_8896,0.02,0.707,0.272,0.9989,0.3831395348837209,0.5737726098191214,0.3776733333333333,1928,153,0.079356846473029,2,37,False,78,0.15,0.1625,0.2875,0.0875,0.1625,0.05,0.0,0.0125,0.0625,0.025,337,214,4.721068249258161,0,0,love everyth place visit twice differ time day short stay madrid staff polit friendli help without overbear decor modern tast visit realli good acoust ibiza session soundtrack play background realli enjoy chose mojito favourit cocktail consid good judg drink year mani differ countri thrill discov cocktail lovingli expertli prepar fresh ingredi plenti alcohol tast superb hous red wine meal great stop food delici first time visit even meal fianc love king prawn risotto mediterranean veget stack goat chees sauc although call someth differ explain well knew expect dish serv hot fresh smile whole time eat chocol browni chocol ice cream dessert gener term portion size also good tast nice crispi shell hous soft decad browni within two mojito two glass red wine two main two dessert set us back incred valu delici meal impress even meal next day left madrid help pop back cacao grab anoth coupl fabul mojito also share nacho among best time bill came recommend fantast restaur enough despit huge choic place eat madrid go back shall return cacao sure,very good review,5,Spanish

I had booked in advance and the restaurant was very responsive, including sending us a set menu due to the size of the group. This was ideal as it was a set price which made settling the bill much easier at the end of the meal! Our table was located in the basement of the restaurant while upstairs had smaller more intimate tables.  The starter course was a selection of 3 tapas dishes to share which were wolfed down by the group. The main was steak, and the restaurant was also able to accommodate the two vegetarians in our group with a delicious alternative. The dessert was individual cheesecakes and also went down well. We were pleasantly full by the time we had finished as well as slightly merry as the set menu included drinks during the starter and main course.  The staff were brilliant and very accommodating of our slightly high spirited group. The restaurant itself was decorated in a vibrant floral style.

Six guys descend of this rather poky provincial looking “feeding hole” in the back streets of Cheuca on a typical Friday night. My initial impression, once inside, was not positive especially as you hit a tall bar and column/pillar in front of my clear vision. The young lady was nice but spoke pigeon English. Very swiftly the magic commenced. A rather dashing waiter came to collect us from the back of this elongated eatery even as she continued to try and pronounce Daniels’ Dutch family name…the waiter had noticed our arrival and heard the name; the table was already and set for our pleasure. Im already impressed .All nice and airy after meandering our persons through the little tabled area we had the nice spacious area at the back. Another two ticks! Enter Hugo, fluent in English, this Catalan was not betraying his roots but reinforcing excellent Spanish hospitality. He articulated almost every item in detail from the starter until we stopped him due to the fear of eating each other as we got hungrier and hungrier. He chose a selection of items and we also had the aid of a couple of bottles of white wine which he also chose. The dishes arrived on time and with excellent presentation. The dishes pleased both the eye and palate and we did re order a couple of items.  We spoke of going back but were too scared similar to making that second date phone call too soon incase it goes pear shaped! In plain English ….this place is fantastic. The service was akin to my experiences at the Gordon Ramsey’s Hospital Road and other 5 stared restaurant…ie fantastic and the food was to go back for.

And I am glad to say it lives up to the hype! To start with, the owner, Hugo, is extremely friendly and personaly greeted every guest in the restaurant. He translated the entire (Spanish only) menu for us and gave us plenty of time to choose (though a good sign was that the menu was not overly extensive) To start with we had the pan seared goats cheese with honey, which was unlike anything I've ever had before...delicious. The patatas bravas were also tasty (and came in a very decent sized portion). Next came the octopus with a light creamy potato foam - again a unique, delicious experience for me. We also had the asparagus with Parmesan and balsamic vinegar, of which the latter had a subtle sweetness to it, enhancing the flavor of the dish. Our mains concluded with a skewer full of tender, succulent iberian pork pieces -it was so good I was about to ask Hugo what the marinade was! Finally we finished off with a yummy vanilla ice cream and strawberry sorbet with coke syrup plus a mojito sorbet - a refreshing way to finish off a fantastic meal I highly recommend this restaurant to any traveller passing through Madrid. Though there are a lot of tourists in the shop, it is definitely NOT your usual tourist trap and is very reasonably priced. I would gladly return here if I visited Madrid again.

We ordered the guacamole & banana chips (very tasty!), the goats cheese (blew our mind) the octopus with potato foam (very unique as we had not tried foamed potato before!) and deliciously seasoned pork skewers with hummus. We finished off with the famous mojito gelati (very refreshing). Hugo and another friendly waiter (sorry we didn't get his name) were very attentive & encouraged us to try some Spanish shots of liquor. Which we happily tried. We were so impressed with the food & service that we returned 2 nights later to try the rabbit, goats cheese salad, the mussels, potatos bravas and finished with strawberry, vanilla & coca cola gelati.

Defintiely don't judge the food by what the restaurant looks like from the alley. The walls are white and it is really small, but the food and service make up for it. Our waiter was so nice and helpful and made some great suggestions. The menu is in Spanish but he helped explain what each dish was. We had the guacamole, squid, and rabbit.

Luckily for us a table for 5 was found downstairs in the restaurant. Initially service was slow; we were left with the menu for about 15 minutes - not an extensive selection, but as we were to find out what this restaurant did produce it produces to an excellent standard! Drinks and food was ordered in due course: two selections each.  I would describe the food here as ""big tapas"" - each dish is delivered as it is cooked, but is a lot more substantial than usual tapas dishes. We ordered between us the pork, beef, Taranaki chicken and burrito - all were fantastic!  This was definitely our best meal during our four day stay in Madrid.

The place didn't seem terribly appealling at first sight, but the waiter who greated us, Joaquin, was charming and explained how each of the dishes on the menu were prepared. He served us hors d'voures that were delicious. Then an assortment of phenomenal croqretas unlike any we have ever tasted. The main courses of pork, lamb and merluza were among the best any of us have eaten. Plates were served with delicious papas souffed.

The food was delicious, service very good; we overall very much enjoyed the experience. Price was very reasonable (we were only charged 80 euro per person for what seemed to be the long tasting menu listed as 132 euro online). Definitely deserving of the Michelin star. First I will note that they were able to accommodate a diner with celiac disease who did not get sick after the meal. We simply made this note on the reservation; many of the courses were naturally gluten free, and for those that were not they were able to make small changes to exclude any gluten. We visited Gaytan on a Saturday night. The restaurant is small - just 5 or 6 tables which all surround the large completely open kitchen area where you can observe the 3 chefs at work (head chef Javier Aranda did not seem to be there the night we visited). Surprisingly only 3 of these tables were full on a Saturday night so the service was extremely good, 3 waiters for only 3 tables with 7 guests in the restaurant. We were not given a choice of menu but it seems we were given the long tasting which ended up being 14 courses total (though surprisingly the bill revealed only an 80 euro/person price at the end!). The spring menu featured a variety of mushrooms, starting with some mushroom based appetizers, then vegetable based courses, followed by fish, and then meat finally followed by desserts. The wine selection seems good and we had two good glasses.",2019-05-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d11434547-Reviews-Gaytan-Madrid.html,UID_8956,0.009,0.893,0.097,0.9738,0.221578947368421,0.5831892230576443,0.4147909090909091,1607,126,0.0784069695084007,1,31,False,64,0.1724137931034483,0.1379310344827586,0.2413793103448276,0.1206896551724138,0.1206896551724138,0.0172413793103448,0.0517241379310344,0.0172413793103448,0.0862068965517241,0.0344827586206896,284,181,4.661971830985915,0,0,gaytan offer creativ uniqu tast menu experi follow style mani cours european tast menu restaur spanish flair chef aranda food delici servic good overal much enjoy experi price reason charg euro per person seem long tast menu list euro onlin definit deserv michelin star first note abl accommod diner celiac diseas get sick meal simpli made note reserv mani cours natur gluten free abl make small chang exclud gluten visit gaytan saturday night restaur small tabl surround larg complet open kitchen area observ chef work head chef javier aranda seem night visit surprisingli tabl full saturday night servic extrem good waiter tabl guest restaur given choic menu seem given long tast end cours total though surprisingli bill reveal euro person price end spring menu featur varieti mushroom start mushroom base appet veget base cours follow fish meat final follow dessert wine select seem good two good glass,very good review,5,Spanish

It was expensive for a little piece of nugget. It was the price of a bottle of wine! But heck, it was a special occasion! I was able to chat a little and tell the chef how much we enjoyed the experience and have a photo taken with him. How delicious was the meal?

One is located in calle Ibiza and the other one in calle Puenteareas.  I can tell you that I could close my eyes and feel like if I was back in Brazil eating the delicious dishes my Brazilian mother in law used to cook.  Each type of meat has its own flavour,  all being  extremely tender. The vegetarian/vegan  buffet is also  very flavoury. We enjoyed a lot eating there!! Before I forget, make sure to start with a Caipirinha, the Brazilian famous cocktail. My favorite one is the kiwi Caipirinha. If you are not a cocktail person, this one will make you change your mind! We are genuinely glad to have discovered that restaurant, and  will definitely go enjoy the rodizio meat buffet (14€) once more before leaving Madrid. Restaurant highly recommended! Ciao Ciao VILA BRASIL es el lugar ideal para comer una deliciosa comida de brasil o simplemente disfrutar de cócteles en el bar o en la terraza. Uno está en la calle ibiza y el otro en calle puenteareas. Puedo decirte que puedo cerrar los ojos y sentir que si estaba de vuelta en brasil comiendo los deliciosos platos que mi madre en la ley usaba para cocinar. Cada tipo de carne tiene su propio sabor, siendo todo muy licitador. El buffet vegetariano/vegetariano también es muy sabroso. ¡disfrutamos comer allí!

The menu offered several vegetarian options which we were not expecting (having to have been flexible with our diets generally in Madrid) and turned out to be delicious, in particular the vegetable lasagna and aubergine chips. They also offer many fish and meat options as well as many side dishes and traditional Spanish wares. The pudding we chose, a melted chocolate dish was delicious and we had to try several items off the cocktail menu! The drinks are presented in a fun way and the food presented professionally and with flair. The hostess was kind enough to let us change tables due to the corner table not being very comfortable for my very tall partner and we were seated in the bright and cosy downstairs.  The place was full of locals which we always take the be a good sign and we were waited on fantastically by two charming and attentive waiters who appeared to be twins! They were very funny and improved the experience even more.  We spent considerable time here that evening and ordered considerable amounts of items also due to the pleasant atmosphere and lovely staff. It made it up there into our favourite experiences as we left our hunger satisfied and smiling.

It is almost hidden, off the main street, up an alley. We arrived there after a seriously long taxi ride from our hotel in Plaza de España. In the dark, their little unlit sign was invisible. We were beginning to think our taxi driver had played a trick. But a friendly local walked us down the alley.  The room is very attractive. The kitchen is the stage. The discreet array of well spaced tables are arranged in a broad semicircle around the stage. Chef Javier stands center stage. Though quite young, he has an imposing presence. He is intense and takes in everything going on in the kitchen and in the audience. His kitchen brigade is alert, precise, and not very relaxed. When you arrive at Gaytan you are invited to have 1 of 2 set menus. Then you begin your first bit of theatre. A series of liquids to 'awaken' your palate, along with a brief description of what will follow. From boxes you are asked to select a pearl, a piece of silk, or something else. That seemed to define what was going to arrive for you. Interesting. Sort of. You are told that you will travel on a journey of dishes from China,through Mongolia, Nepal, Persia,India Italy, France and finally Spain. Those responsible to carry out the explanations have a big responsibility to keep it interesting, fun, and understandable. Our waiter was earnest, but his English was marginal. He didn't seem to get it when we didn't understand him. He just motored on with the spiel. Things felt hokey at times. The opening dish was a drama. Chicken,roasted corn, mushrooms and vegetable infusion with a Beijing duck taco. A small serving with remarkable intensity and complexity. From Mongolia came Horse Mackerel Tartare, Cured Yolk, and Black Garlic Fluid. This arrived in a small plastic bag. Scissors were provided to cut the bag. You then squeezed the contents onto your plate. It was extremely delicious just the same. Most of the remaining dishes ranged from very good to just OK. The theatrics of the presentations too often overshadowed the pure food flavours we were seeking. We opted for the wine pairings. Our waiter turned out to also be the sommelier. We had some pleasant wines, but they often did not fit the dish. There was a randomness to what arrived. This is after all a fairly pricey evening. More could be expected here. So overall a mix. It is a novel experience. The theatrics were interesting at times. Some of the food tastes were exotic and fascinating. The wine service was lacking.

These were very unique and delicious and followed a fun story line which continued at the table. We chose to opt for the smaller tasting menu with the traditional wine pairings. The first course, which was a soup inspired from China, was very delicious in flavor but very overwhelming (as well as filling) due to its bold flavors and thick texture in comparison to the serving size. Another issue we experience was overcooked meat on some dishes. The fish on one dish was so tough and rubbery it was left on the plate after one bite. The tasting menu, however, had 3-4 plates that were delicious. The best plate on the menu was the pulled duck taco dish. The rest were very disappointing, lacking balance and harmony in it's flavors and textures. The flavors sometimes were very bold and too strong for the amount you received in the dish. The wine pairing was disappointing to say the least. While there were a few good wines the sommelier selected, none of which paired well with the courses presented, either underwhelming or overwhelming the dishes. The story behind the dishes in traveling through different countries was fun and unique. There were several unique utensils and plates. The service was good but it seemed that they were rushed, not ""in synch"" with each other, and at times lost. There seemed to be a lot of pressure to have everything ""perfect"" which seemed to create a stressful atmosphere for the staff as well as it's guest.  Overall, there were several good dishes (especially the duck taco), however it is not enough for us to come back for another visit.

Unfortunately, I was there a little bit early and given the freezing day it was, having to wait for them to open the doors at 2pm was a little bit of a downer.  The interior is simple but elegant. The fully open kitchen and basically eye level, allows all the customers to fully enjoy the art in the food creation. I was impressed that given a very important personality was dining as well at the place, all the tables were served to perfection.  On the food side, we had the long degustación menu and were fairly impressed with all the dishes. There were two that did not really say much to me, which were the mushroom dish as the cochinillo. For the desserts, they are light and would rate them normal. I always forget to take pictures of the dishes until it is too late, but one day I will get there.

The restaurant is beautiful and chic - few desks turned to the central piece of the room, where the open kitchen is located (with the best exhaustion system I have ever seen). It is quite the experience Gaytán offers - from beginning to the end. You will see liquid nitrogen being used to harmonize cocktails, the Lamb Experience composition will also blow your mind (after they tell you what it was you ate, part of the experience :)) However, I did feel the restaurant to be a little cold and not so friendly. I did not feel very comfortable - not sure if it was the fact that we had to stare at the staff the entire time, or the tight timing we had to actually have our meals.It is also really tricky to find, it is located at a side entrance of a parking lot and we only found the sign indicating entrance long after the meal ended. It is also a bit tricky to leave if you have a late dinner given the location of the restaurant is a bit outside the main hubs and it took us about 15 minutes to get a Taxi. Gaytán defintely deserves its stars - impecable Menu and super criative dihses that will be food for the eyes as well!

We were always impressed with the food, their service, and the whimsical ambience of the restaurant. I was excited to return upon my most recent visit to Madrid, but found our experience underwhelming at best. First, the food was much worse than it used to be. The paella did not have even a hint of saffron flavour, and the rice was overcooked. The croquetas were overly creamy and undercooked.  The service was good: the staff was friendly and fast, but almost suspiciously fast (we were in and out in 50 minutes, much shorter than the usual 2 hour dinner to be expected in most European restaurants), and we felt rushed out of the restaurant.  It seems to me this once-authentic Spanish restaurant has compromised quality in order to rake in the tourists (who love fast service and usually probably cannot tell the difference in authentic Spanish food).

Brilliant - but must have been a pain for them and costly.  Service levels excellent - despite it being just the 3 of us and assuming all the staff were probably thinking of being elsewhere.  Great decor - spacious and relaxing interior.  We took the long tasting menu - 10 countries and 16 was courses. Just slightly too much for me as I was struggling slightly towards the end. A journey based on the old silk route from China to Spain stopping off in various countries along the way to experience their take on local food during the period of the silk trade.  All dishes extremely well presented with colour, textures layout etc. Some dishes worked better than others - a great mini Indian meal (4 courses served together) and also a dish fro Italy of an inside- out crunchy ravioli excellent and very flavour some, but others not so well- this fish course for example, the purée didn’t match with the fish and the fish itself was not so tasty.  Overall highly enjoyable and much changed since my previous visit (2 years ago?).  Would be a 4.5 if I could record that. Just slightly undone by a couple of the less successful dishes.

We were not disappointed as we had a superb dining experience. The restaurant was a little bit tricky to find as it is actually located down the side of a building that fronts Principe de Vergara and carries the same street number, being, 205, as it would appear do several other buildings. It is located very near to Concha Espina metro station. The interior design is innovative and creative with the open kitchen being in a semi circle and the wooden dining tables also being curved with the diners both on the same side of the table facing the kitchen almost as if you are watching a theatre production with the entertainment being provided by the chefs. We had the Dining Experience tasting menu which was comprised of an amuse bouche, 6 tasting snacks, 6 mains, a pre-dessert, dessert and a fantastic little covered wagon that contained the petit-fours at a cost of Euro100 per head. All of the dishes were beautifully presented and extremely tasty. Gaytan also had gluten free bread. Wine list was extensive with a number of reasonably priced bottles as well as top of the range. Service was excellent, friendly and efficient, with all of the dishes being explained. Fabio, in particular, was first class. Lunch took about 2 and a half hours however we didn't notice any real length of time between dishes, they all seemed to be well spaced.

The World Journey Tour was pretty good in that I have been to all the cuisines touched. They took an Asian country and put Javiar's version on it and he was pretty good.

Unfortunately you have only a set menu (either 10 or 14 courses) which is intriguing, but to a certain element also limiting the choices, as you cannot select from a menu. The journey is interesting and you need to take it really as an experience in a discovery park where people at the table describing the plates are trying to tell you a story that is somehow limited. So the storyline comes out a bit awkward and out of context. Without further elaborating on this, the culinary experience is great. You are sitting in front of the kitchen where in a half circle or as an ""amphitheatre"" they prepare your dishes. Looking at these chefs is amazing: all their movements are professional, precise and you can feel their skills. All different delicacies are incredibly presented and stunning.

Each dish thereafter continued to toy with your palate in inventive and exotic ways. Each plate became a palate for visual food art. The drink pairings were equally well thought-out and pleasing. Surround seating allowed for observation of the quiet competence and interplay of kitchen staff. Service was attentive and friendly, never overbearing or stuffy.

First thing on entry was the wine cooler full and smoking. Coats taken and the to our table.  Very cleverly designed - round tables that split into 2 and arranged as in a jazz club / Caberet with the stage obviously the kitchen which all could see- around the large mushroom like pillars.  We took the long tasting menu (only options a long and shorter version). For the evening it was to be honest 1 - 2 plates too many, but maybe that is age.  All dishes presented immaculately with great attention to detail and fully explained. Mixture of textures and flavours all working well together. Many interesting deconstructed dishes.  A fantastic risotto - but without any rice! Great fish dish cooked on the table in front of us and a very good lamb dish.  A couple of things didn't quite work - baby squid nice but not to the level of the rest. But the rest fantastic.  A real eye opener and much more imaginative and surprising that expected.

Back home in the States as a family we have been enjoying watching shows like 'Chef's Table' together. Honestly, I had always thought that sometimes the architectural food I would see in those shows looked a little pretentious and wasn't sure how the food would actually taste. So, I told my boys to appreciate the attention to detail and passion with which the food was created.  THE FOOD BLEW US ALL AWAY!!  The talented and rising star young chef, Javiar Aranda was working hard all night right near us and he is able to infuse incredible and contrasting flavors and textures into dishes in a way that is totally surprising and satisfying. We had a full degustation menu that lasted over three hours with the wine pairings that highlighted for us what an incredibly delicious and well-priced national treasure the wines are in Spain. I was hopeful that my youngest ( age 11 ) would enjoy the meal, along with his ""foodie' big brothers. He ate everything and thanked me (!) after each course ( of which there were 17 ) for bringing him there. For all of us, we were so satisfied we weren't hungry for practically the whole next day and we have had a lot of fun discussing the meal and every aspect of it. I read a recent review where the person got there early and had to wait for the restaurant to open. We had the same experience at 9 p.m. and loved the fact 1. that in Spain that is when a restaurant is opening and 2. that the Spaniards can be so relaxed. It made us get out of our normal New York heads and to be there in more ways than one. And though this is not an inexpensive meal, the value of this meal with it's creativity and quality of food and wine served is tremendous.",2017-01-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d11434547-Reviews-or20-Gaytan-Madrid.html,UID_9039,0.009,0.816,0.175,0.9961,0.2739641311069882,0.5472613894042465,0.5266642857142857,1783,164,0.0919798093101514,4,43,False,67,0.1969696969696969,0.2424242424242424,0.303030303030303,0.0606060606060606,0.1666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0303030303030303,0.0,331,212,4.38368580060423,0,0,famili first experi go michelin star restaur winner back home state famili enjoy watch show like chef tabl togeth honestli alway thought sometim architectur food would see show look littl pretenti sure food would actual tast told boy appreci attent detail passion food creat food blew us away talent rise star young chef javiar aranda work hard night right near us abl infus incred contrast flavor textur dish way total surpris satisfi full degust menu last three hour wine pair highlight us incred delici well price nation treasur wine spain hope youngest age would enjoy meal along foodi big brother ate everyth thank cours bring us satisfi hungri practic whole next day lot fun discuss meal everi aspect read recent review person got earli wait restaur open experi p love fact spain restaur open spaniard relax made us get normal new york head way one though inexpens meal valu meal creativ qualiti food wine serv tremend,very good review,5,Spanish

The staff were great and explained each course but their accents speaking in English meant we lost quite a lot of their explanation and had to ask each time for different parts to be repeated before we got it! The kitchen staff are watching you, sometimes we felt to see if you liked their concoctions but more usually to get the timing of the next course spot on, which they did. They were true professionals. The kitchen itself is very modern and you sit around and facing it though there are some places where viewing proceedings would be more challenging from behind a pillar - try and reserve a good view, it's worth it. We have the full tasting menu which was extensive with small snacks before dishes with chicken satay, scallop, white beans, mushroom soup, sweet potato with a mussel sauce, crab, red mullet, Peruvian beef, wonderful lamb and two delicious sweets (apologies for my pitiful descriptions but I just recall the headline ingredient in each dish!). There was a beautiful selection of bread served as well which could have been disastrous as they offered and we would have eaten more but sensibly declined. The presentation and detail was fantastic and included not only the food but the serving dishes and cutlery which came in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. Gaytan's selection of wines accompanied the food superb and I would recommend having this rather than choosing one or two wines yourself. The wine pairing cost 50 euro's and dinner 101 euro's each. Thanks to other contributors who provided help on finding the restaurant. The entrance is at 205 Principe de Vergara and down an alleyway that is on the left hand side of a car park. There is a smartly dressed doorman waiting to receive you at the from door when you arrive. There is a sign on a street lamp-post that says ""Gaytan"" so you shouldn't miss it. When we were ready to leave, we asked the staff to get us a taxi and when one was there, they told us so there was no waiting around outside. A great and very memorable experience and I hope we will be back sometime.",2018-01-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d11434547-Reviews-or10-Gaytan-Madrid.html,UID_9048,0.036,0.766,0.198,0.9977,0.2540173847316704,0.5388114134542706,0.4045133333333333,2215,188,0.0848758465011286,3,43,False,73,0.1184210526315789,0.1842105263157894,0.3289473684210526,0.0789473684210526,0.1578947368421052,0.0131578947368421,0.0,0.0263157894736842,0.0526315789473684,0.0394736842105263,393,247,4.638676844783715,0,0,realli enjoy eat food servic experi realli enjoy though end flavour begin merg staff great explain cours accent speak english meant lost quit lot explan ask time differ part repeat got kitchen staff watch sometim felt see like concoct usual get time next cours spot true profession kitchen modern sit around face though place view proceed would challeng behind pillar tri reserv good view worth full tast menu extens small snack dish chicken satay scallop white bean mushroom soup sweet potato mussel sauc crab red mullet peruvian beef wonder lamb two delici sweet apolog piti descript recal headlin ingredi dish beauti select bread serv well could disastr offer would eaten sensibl declin present detail fantast includ food serv dish cutleri came sort differ shape size gaytan select wine accompani food superb would recommend rather choos one two wine wine pair cost euro dinner euro thank contributor provid help find restaur entranc princip de vergara alleyway left hand side car park smartli dress doorman wait receiv door arriv sign street lamp post say gaytan miss readi leav ask staff get us taxi one told us wait around outsid great memor experi hope back sometim,very good review,5,French

We ordered the sangria blanco which is made to order not like most places which are premade. So tasty. The best white sangria we had in Madrid. We also had the potatoes with spicy sauce, shrimp with garlic & octopus. The potatoes were hand cut wedges, perfectly cooked & delicious. The spicy sauce was not my favorite so we did the mayo ketchup instead. The garlic shrimp were a few large ones with plenty of slices of garlic in a flavorful oil. So fresh & full of flavor.

It's not a bad restaurant but the décor, surroundings, ambiance, service and presentation of food cannot catapult it to this level in its peer group in Madrid as it just isn't that good. The surroundings were shabby and the walls were pine clad. Whilst I can cope with that the service was indifferent and occasional. There was no table cloth, the mains arrived before the starter plates were removed and we were asked to keep our cutlery from one course to the next. Service was slow and the staff were difficult to attract. We would have had more drinks had the service been more efficient; we might even have had a sweet course had we been asked but by then we had tired of the place, having cleared our main courses onto an adjacent table ourselves as the staff weren't going to clear the table. We had the arepas degustacion as a shared starter between the 4 of us. We are familiar with Venezuelan food and they were fine but nothing special. After a long wait, our mains of pabellon, fajitas and salmon plancha arrived and their common theme was they were all cold. As we had been waiting and the hour was late, we got on with the cold food which again was OK but nothing spectacular, apart from the obvious, that it would have tasted better had it been hot.  At no point did any staff ask us how we were enjoying our meal, if there was anything further that we needed etc. We had to go to the front desk to get and pay for our bill which with Perrier, 2 rum cocktails, Sangria Cava and the food described above, was over 100 euro's. Will we be back - no! The really annoying part was that expectations failed to be fulfilled which is entirely the responsibility of over promotion by Trip Advisor and the way their system works.",2018-01-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10786717-Reviews-or210-Cacao_Restobar-Madrid.html,UID_9048,0.087,0.817,0.096,0.6994,0.0533963585434173,0.5403361344537815,0.4219642857142856,1910,191,0.1,1,37,False,58,0.1111111111111111,0.125,0.2083333333333333,0.0555555555555555,0.1805555555555555,0.0555555555555555,0.0277777777777777,0.0416666666666666,0.1388888888888889,0.0555555555555555,350,205,4.457142857142857,0,0,visit restaur rate th restaur madrid quickli realis serious promot trip advisor list bad restaur cor surround ambianc servic present food cannot catapult level peer group madrid good surround shabbi wall pine clad whilst cope servic indiffer occasion tabl cloth main arriv starter plate remov ask keep cutleri one cours next servic slow staff difficult attract would drink servic effici might even sweet cours ask tire place clear main cours onto adjac tabl staff go clear tabl arepa degustacion share starter us familiar venezuelan food fine noth special long wait main pabellon fajita salmon plancha arriv common theme cold wait hour late got cold food ok noth spectacular apart obviou would tast better hot point staff ask us enjoy meal anyth need etc go front desk get pay bill perrier rum cocktail sangria cava food describ euro back realli annoy part expect fail fulfil entir respons promot trip advisor way system work,very bad review,1,Spanish

It was absolutely delicious, we’ve never had something like this. If you go, make sure you try this. The final dish we had was the lamb stuffed with goat cheese, another great dish. My wife is not a big fan of lamb, but she loved this. For dessert we had White Chocolate Foam with Raspberries. The foam was just the right touch. It was simply delectable.

Difficult to locate (we walked) and when we did find it were not sure if we had arrived at the right place (small, few tables etc..). Luckily we decided to stay. We immediately hit it off with the owner (I'm a little bit of a foodie) and when we mentioned we have a house in Miami Beach and that one of our favorite restaurants there is Pub Belly, turns out the owner of Pub Belly is one of his best friends....well the night was made. The food is exceptional, tapas portions easily shared between two people. Unique though is the Chefs modern interpretation of classical Castillian and Catalonian dishes. The guacamole/bananas..wonderful way to start the dinner, the croqueta boletus (light and creamy, beautifully fried), the pulpo plancha (nicely prepared and very delicate) and finally the pincho de secreto...just wish we could have had more. To top it off the people at the table next to us had the mejillones and thet were so enthusiastic that we had to try them (despite my dislike for mussels). Phenomenal, couldn't leave a drop of the sauce behind. We ate too much but despite the abundance of food the bill wea very reasonable,90 euro. Can't say enough of the owner, knowledgeable, enthusiastic, friendly, someone I'd like to meet again, hopefully soon at the Taberna.",2013-02-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or350-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9077,0.012,0.825,0.163,0.9855,0.2239208909370199,0.6115463389656938,0.53544,1375,109,0.0792727272727272,0,52,False,49,0.1346153846153846,0.1346153846153846,0.25,0.0769230769230769,0.173076923076923,0.0384615384615384,0.0576923076923076,0.0,0.1153846153846153,0.0192307692307692,237,166,4.805907172995781,0,0,last night madrid came read review trip advisor chowhound difficult locat walk find sure arriv right place small tabl etc luckili decid stay immedi hit owner littl bit foodi mention hous miami beach one favorit restaur pub belli turn owner pub belli one best friend well night made food except tapa portion easili share two peopl uniqu though chef modern interpret classic castillian catalonian dish guacamol banana wonder way start dinner croqueta boletu light creami beauti fri pulpo plancha nice prepar delic final pincho de secreto wish could top peopl tabl next us mejillon thet enthusiast tri despit dislik mussel phenomen leav drop sauc behind ate much despit abund food bill wea reason euro say enough owner knowledg enthusiast friendli someon like meet hope soon taberna,very good review,5,Spanish

We waited in the somewhat sketchy neighborhood for it to open. Doors didn't open till 8:30, and we found that they did not have us written down, but even though they were booked full, since it was Valentine's Day, they allowed us in. Thank goodness. The owner broke down the entire menu for us in English and stopped us when he thought we were ordering too much. My husband liked the guacamole and plantains the best and i thought the octopus was amazing. The staff and owner were attentive and the dishes came out in perfect time, one after the other. The owner told us his philosophy that he cares more about producing good food that a smaller number of people would enjoy rather than okay food for a larger mass of people. it may me harder to make more money that way, but he is passionate about the food.

Extremely friendly staff who explain specialities, how their food is cooked and answer any questions you have in Spanish or in English. If you don't finish anything, they ask you why and if everything was ok.  Also this is a restaurant so of course the food had to be great. Cacao Restobar is meant to serve up Latin American dishes and it does arepas and fajitas very well. There are also typical Spanish options like patatas bravas and flavorful risotto cooked to al dente. Instead of my usual vino tinto or tinto de verano, I was recommended the sangria and the reason became quite clear soon after. My friend and I shared tres leches which was super milky (as it should - the best tres leches I have had in my life was at Porto's Bakery in Glendale, California, and this comes extremely close, possibly at par.) Last but not least, the location is super convenient for anyone before or after museum visits, eg, Prado, Reina Sofia, Thyssen, or Sol even. But if you want to eat during typical Spanish meal time, you should definitely book in advance. One quick tip: wifi only works in the front by the bar, almost doesn't work at all in the back section.

Plus this place is super small it's not very convenient to take too many friends there. So our verdict is this: hop in get a beer share the pulpo dish and then pay and leave for more pintxos elsewhere..",2012-11-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or360-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_373,0.042,0.754,0.204,0.9622,0.1706060606060606,0.5847916666666667,0.2423499999999999,508,54,0.1062992125984252,0,9,False,18,0.1052631578947368,0.1578947368421052,0.3157894736842105,0.0526315789473684,0.1578947368421052,0.0,0.0,0.0526315789473684,0.1052631578947368,0.0526315789473684,98,79,4.1938775510204085,0,0,live madrid natur curiou restaur rate highli ta find tapa realli felt wow creami pulpo la gallega convinc gastrobar madrid better creativ tasti cook plu place super small conveni take mani friend verdict hop get beer share pulpo dish pay leav pintxo elsewher,average review,3,Spanish

We cannot include our experience here in our list of good restaurants however. It's a small place, with minimal decor. Yes, the owner is very friendly and accommodating, and spoke good English. We ordered 5 items; Three came out one right after another. Our first course, the Fois, came out so cold that we had to wait and let it warm up some, to enjoy (and spread) it. The goat cheese salad was quite good, as was the tikka masala mussels - though the sauce was very salty. The Pulpo (octopus) we would pass on again, too much cream/cheese and the secreto Iberian skewers were flavorless and overcooked. Where they really lack is in the service; there's the owner explaining the menu and taking the orders, and one other person staffing the room. Each time our next course came, the last course still remained, and we had to shuffle our plates to make room. Additionally, we were left with the plates from the previous course, sauces and all, and we had to ask for new fresh plates to enjoy the next course. I thought after we asked the first time that he would be responsive for future courses, but we had to ask again after each course. Bottom line, it was average food at above average prices ($100US) with poor service, in a nutshell. To top it off, there was a couple with a young child two tables away from us, who was climbing on the table and making a lot of noise in the restaurant, causing us (and other tables around us) to be annoyed. We mentioned this to the server at the beginning of the meal, and again once more, and we heard others commenting as well. His response to us was that he couldn't do anything about it. Don't get the impression that my experience was skewed by the child; yes, that was an annoyance. But I am commenting on the food and the service here, and for my last night in Madrid, this trip, I was sorely disappointed in the food and the service...and I wouldn't return nor recommend it to my friends.",2012-11-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or360-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9104,0.046,0.867,0.087,0.8714,0.1049464424464424,0.3976134976134976,0.4465764705882353,2016,184,0.0912698412698412,0,69,False,85,0.1839080459770115,0.160919540229885,0.2183908045977011,0.057471264367816,0.1494252873563218,0.0344827586206896,0.0344827586206896,0.0,0.1379310344827586,0.0229885057471264,372,221,4.422043010752688,0,0,spent month spain day madrid outstand food cannot includ experi list good restaur howev small place minim decor ye owner friendli accommod spoke good english order item three came one right anoth first cours foi came cold wait let warm enjoy spread goat chees salad quit good tikka masala mussel though sauc salti pulpo octopu would pass much cream chees secreto iberian skewer flavorless overcook realli lack servic owner explain menu take order one person staf room time next cours came last cours still remain shuffl plate make room addit left plate previou cours sauc ask new fresh plate enjoy next cours thought ask first time would respons futur cours ask cours bottom line averag food averag price us poor servic nutshel top coupl young child two tabl away us climb tabl make lot nois restaur caus us tabl around us annoy mention server begin meal heard other comment well respons us anyth get impress experi skew child ye annoy comment food servic last night madrid trip sore disappoint food servic return recommend friend,average review,3,Spanish

I had an amazing meal here and would go back again in a heartbeat if I could. As I was dining alone it's a shame that I couldn't try out a lot of the menu due to portion sizes and cost but the waiter was absolutely fantastic helping me to translate the entire menu for me. Service like this is a rare breed and is to be applauded. I opted for the banana chips and guacamole. Hands down the best guacamole I've ever had. Stunning. Then I had some spicy potato dish which whilst certainly tasty left me regretting choosing this over other dishes on the menu. Then I had the lamb skewer. I've eaten a lot of meat in my time but oh my, it tasted so good and the meat was just melting in my mouth. I couldn't say no to desert and wasn't let down by what I can only describe as a plain chocolate soup dotted with crunchy breadcrumbs, olive oil and a tiny amount of salt. Again, tasted fantastic, every ingredient earning its place in the dish. I just wish I could go back again and try the restaurant highlights.

Fantastic inspirational cocktails made by Chris - try the smoked bourbon/orange infusion - it is amazing! Carlos, Edgar and Edicsson - who manage and own the bar were always around and all so friendly. There is a lovely atmosphere to the place with fantastic and well thought out decor for the bar area and the 2 other eating rooms. Every area was exceptionally clean and comfortable.

Everything is made ""in house"" and it shows. Fresh, fresh, fresh. The homemade sangria, served in a mason jar was garnished with cinnamon stick and lots of fruit. Delicious. Service was fairly swift, but we were never rushed. Yummy was the Arepas degustacion and the Patacones, a pulled pork tapas starter. Then the beef and chicken fajitas were served garnished with sour cream (their version, very good), avocado cream, grated cheese and chopped tomatoes and onions. All very filling, but don't miss the desserts. We shared brownie and homemade ice and lemon pie. Along with the check came a delicious, complimentary chocolate liquor.

It took insistent TripAdvisor gushes to coax me in the first time, and the experience was so overwhelmingly positive that I've made it one of my very few ""regular"" places in the city. The pulpo, the pulpo! Get the octopus with potato foam; it alone is enough to warrant repeat visits. The impossibly creamy guacamole also shines, but the true star here is owner Hugo, who was absolutely born for this line of work. My visits have been spaced out with multiple months in between, and the guy's not only recognized me warmly each and every time, but also recalled my HAIRCUTS. His English is outstanding, and he's an impeccable host. I've been here with my mother, I've been here with dates, I've been here with great old friends.

The failings of tourist aimed croquettes around the city are revealed by the ethereal lightness of the mushroom croquettes that despite their appearance nearly float in your mouth. And just when you think you have enjoyed octopus everyway possible, this kitchen comes up with a paprika magic preparation that people apparently flock here for.

We were told that each dish would be plenty for the two of us and it was. We ordered the red wine, bread, Guacamole with plantain chips, Orange Honey salad, grilled asparagus with parmesan cheese, and kabobs. We were very full but Hugo suggested we at least share the mint sorbet with rum, we were glad we did! He then served us 2 shots (free)! One was a red berry and the other some herb – did NOT like the berry but we did like the other. Everything was so GREAT we had to come back for another night. We ordered the orange salad again, Foie Gras, caramelized goat cheese with honey sauce, and BBQ ribs. It was all excellent other than the ribs. They were very tasty but we are Texans so we really should have skipped BBQ Ribs. Their specialty is the mussels, and octopus but my husband won’t eat either of those!

We hadn't much luck with food in Madrid for the few nights we were there but that all changed when we found this place. The food was so so tasty and the prices were fantastic . The cocktails also went down a treat also. The staff were all so friendly and the manager/ owner (not sure) made us aware that the restaurant had two sister restaurants in close proximity. We ended up going to the sister restaurant which was no more than a 5 minute walk away the next day and that was superb also.,2018-09-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7204621-Reviews-or590-Rosi_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_9193,0.051,0.763,0.186,0.9667,0.1608585858585858,0.5025252525252525,0.40906,614,58,0.0944625407166123,0,10,False,34,0.1,0.2,0.2666666666666666,0.1,0.1666666666666666,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,115,83,4.3478260869565215,0,0,two friend came across tapa restaur chanc eye caught fantast exterior design much luck food madrid night chang found place food tasti price fantast cocktail also went treat also staff friendli manag owner sure made us awar restaur two sister restaur close proxim end go sister restaur minut walk away next day superb also,good review,4,Spanish

Ups: Great food, we ordered tuna tartar, massala mussels (mejillones) and octopus in potatoe cream... Mmm delicious, I just remembered and wanted to taste all again. Great service, very nice people serving the tables, and I'm not sure if we were lucky or the kitchen had us timed, but each time we finished a dish, the next was ready in our table. Good quality-price ratio Downs: There was no English, nor French menus a la carte, and the place is in a very touristic neighborhood so if you decide to try it, you'll probably end up guessing what you'll eat, because they have very gourmet options and no good English skills to explain you that the dish is deer for example, exactly what happened to the folks next to our table, they were watching all the dishes to decide what to order, so a good recommendation for the restaurant is to invest in a menu translation option. You can reply this message, I can help you with that.  We went with very high expectations (actually we reserved via phone) we were downsided by the fact that the restaurant allows street sales (peddling) inside, no good for your image, except if you have some sort of ONG support campaign though... Because of that I'll give it a 8 over 10. Overall very good experience.

The service was very attentive and friendly at all times. They also had no difficulties speaking and understanding English, which wasn't always the case in Madrid.

It's quite unassuming when you walk up but the food was YUM. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and even though they were called ""spicy"" potatoes, they weren't. Get the half order...trust me. My two favorites were the goat cheese (freaking amazing) and the mojito sorbet with a shot of ""something"" in it. We had some great wine as well. The biggest bummer for me was that we couldn't have paella or anything with rice because the (one) guy who makes their rice was sick. Strange to hear, but I guess in these smaller places, they have one guy who does that one thing.

The waitress was very apologetic and took us through to the bar where she then gave us some complimentary guacamole as an apology. Whilst this was a nice touch, we ended up waiting well over an hour to finally be seated which was rather frustrating - it then took a long time for anyone to come and take our order. The food itself was very good - we ordered the octopus and asparagus to start, before moving on to the lobster paella. The octopus was very rich, but the asparagus was delicious, as was the paella (although the lobster meat itself was somewhat limited). We had a nice bottle of rioja, but we particularly enjoyed their 'special recipe' sangria - so delicious and refreshing, and highly recommended.  Overall it was a very good meal and not a bad price overall, however the service was rather a disappointment. Whilst the staff were very friendly, they seemed to just be running round all over the place and all rather chaotic (despite having 4 waiters in what is only a small restaurant). The restaurant was busy and so I definitely recommend booking (just hope they don't give your table away!). Aside from the service, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and really enjoyed the food and sangria.",2015-09-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or160-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9225,0.056,0.699,0.245,0.9957,0.2430238095238095,0.6335317460317461,0.4214888888888889,1324,118,0.0891238670694864,1,33,False,58,0.140625,0.140625,0.203125,0.078125,0.140625,0.046875,0.078125,0.015625,0.09375,0.0625,232,146,4.706896551724138,0,0,despit reserv disappoint find arriv tabl accident given away waitress apologet took us bar gave us complimentari guacamol apolog whilst nice touch end wait well hour final seat rather frustrat took long time anyon come take order food good order octopu asparagu start move lobster paella octopu rich asparagu delici paella although lobster meat somewhat limit nice bottl rioja particularli enjoy special recip sangria delici refresh highli recommend overal good meal bad price overal howev servic rather disappoint whilst staff friendli seem run round place rather chaotic despit waiter small restaur restaur busi definit recommend book hope give tabl away asid servic thoroughli enjoy meal realli enjoy food sangria,very good review,5,Mexican

A small and cosy place but extremely smart at the same time.  It's tucked away in a quiet side street between Calle de Goya and Calle de Alcala but not too hard to find. We were staying near Goya station, so only a short stroll away.  I love tapas but have only ever really experienced the 'main stream' offerings. This place takes it to the next level, with contemporary versions of a variety of dishes.  We arrived with hungry bellies and no pre-set idea of what we were going to have. The waiter, who was extremely friendly and professional suggested that we let him select a range of dishes for us, which proved to be a fantastic eclectic mix from fried broccoli to sweetbreads. He also recommended the wines to accompany the food, which were superb and not over priced.  If you try nothing else, have the deep fried broccoli, which was a taste sensation! Something I would never have dreamt of ordering but it turns out to be their signature dish. Worth going their just for that...  Four of us ate until we were comfortably full and drank liberally but the bill only came to 150 euros (without service), which, considering the quality of everything, I thought was fantastic value.

A restaurant that recreates tapas for the modern era and actually serves vegetables, and fruits in their desserts. The restaurant is intimate and cozy with a very friendly staff that goes out there way to explain the dishes. If you're an American, like me, whose limited experience with vermouth is in a martini, then start out with a red vermouth aperitif and you'll understand why Spaniards can't get enough of the stuff. It's a limited menu but since each item is exquisitely prepared you will have more than enough to eat. Our server was kind enough to ask us before serving all the dishes we had ordered if we had had enough and our answer was a unanimous yes. My wife and I shared the sardines, mussels, 2 of the the broccoli since they are so good you must have one each, the mushrooms and the Iberian pork sandwich with mustard. Each of the tapas was creatively prepared and delicious. The tomato and bean dish was superb but we were there in the beginning of September when the tomatoes could not have been more perfect. All of this was washed down with Les Crestes, a delicious and very fairly priced wine from Priorat. For dessert we shared the peach yogurt citrus streusel and the chocolate blackberry chantilly, both of which were wonderful. Our only problem now, is where do we we eat dinner tomorrow???",2017-09-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10678592-Reviews-or10-RECREO_Espartinas-Madrid.html,UID_2300,0.032,0.768,0.199,0.9952,0.3516926655719759,0.6094690749863164,0.4089461538461538,1428,136,0.0952380952380952,0,32,False,39,0.1538461538461538,0.1538461538461538,0.3076923076923077,0.0461538461538461,0.1846153846153846,0.0307692307692307,0.0,0.0153846153846153,0.0615384615384615,0.0461538461538461,254,169,4.625984251968504,0,0,ok tire iberian ham chorizo patata brava smother aioli recreo rescu restaur recreat tapa modern era actual serv veget fruit dessert restaur intim cozi friendli staff goe way explain dish american like whose limit experi vermouth martini start red vermouth aperitif understand spaniard get enough stuff limit menu sinc item exquisit prepar enough eat server kind enough ask us serv dish order enough answer unanim ye wife share sardin mussel broccoli sinc good must one mushroom iberian pork sandwich mustard tapa creativ prepar delici tomato bean dish superb begin septemb tomato could perfect wash le crest delici fairli price wine priorat dessert share peach yogurt citru streusel chocol blackberri chantilli wonder problem eat dinner tomorrow,good review,4,Spanish

One reason that we enjoyed it so much was the fabulous Rosi La Loca Taberna restaurant.  We were warmly welcomed again back to the restaurant during our first visit back this year. The food and service last year was the best, however this year and they stepped it up even further. The service was just as warm and friendly, but the food presentation was amazing. It is hard to beat. Our first visit this year, was early afternoon, when we had the Menu del Dia. Another wonderful well prepared and beautiful meal. We have a very restricted eating style, and again they were attentive to our requirements. We did not feel that we were inconveniencing our waiter at all. The house wine, which comes with the menu was so good, we ordered it for our final meal in Madrid.  We had the Hawaiian Salad each time we ate at Rosi’s. They offered one of their very best salads for the Menu del Dia.  The had an amazing presentation for lunch, but the supper presentation was to die for. Look at the pictures below we have the tuna and the octopus for supper.  By the way do not go there for supper without a reservation because they are so busy all the time.  The restaurant has such a fun atmosphere at suppertime. The bartender was taking pictures of all his beautiful creations before the waiter takes them to the table. The staff are having so much fun. It makes the meal so much more enjoyable.  When they came out with the tuna it was in a boat with steam coming from dry ice. The picture which I have put in with this review does not do justice for the beauty and excitement created. The tuna that was absolutely the best I’ve ever had.

You cannot go wrong when ordering here but some of my personal favorites are: goat cheese with basil and honey, tuna tar tar, sobrasada salad, chicken leg with dates and bacon, and the ribs. Once again, you can't go wrong when ordering here- every dish is more delicious than the next. Lastly, the service here has always been incredible. They will tell you how much to order for the amount of people you are with. When the owner is around, he comes up to the table to speak to you and suggest dishes.

We showed up on a Friday night based on tripadvisor reviews without a reservation and were first told that they had no seats for us. Luckily a family at the bar was wrapping up their meal and offered us their seats if we didn't mind sitting at the bar. We took those seats and had no idea what we were in store for. Hugo, whom I assume is the owner, came by and explained each dishes to us in detail which was very impressive since the dishes were not only eclectic but also extremely creative. Hugo said that he has lived in the states before working with Jose Andres which was cool because we had just visited the Bazaar before our trip.  We took a lot of his suggestions and LOVED every dish! I especially enjoyed the calamari, which is nothing like the usual fried calamari in other tapa bars. My family also liked the pork skewers, which had a great cumin flavor. Honestly we liked everything we tried and probably could've returned for another meal to try all the other dishes if we had more time. Hugo was very busy tending to the crowd but always made sure he came by to check up on us throughout the night. He has a great personality and we really enjoyed chatting with him. We really didn't have room for dessert but tried two anyway since everyone else in the restaurant were having them. The mojito dessert was so refreshing and delicious!  I think if you're looking for ""traditional"" tapas then this is obviously not the place for you, but if you're open minded and would like to try some inventive, tasty, and fun food, then you have to come check this place out!!",2013-05-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or320-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9246,0.016,0.796,0.188,0.997,0.4073958333333333,0.6909126984126984,0.5511199999999999,1692,159,0.0939716312056737,4,34,False,77,0.1153846153846153,0.1538461538461538,0.5,0.1153846153846153,0.1153846153846153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,315,185,4.368253968253968,0,0,complet day spain trip famili peopl place favorit meal trip show friday night base tripadvisor review without reserv first told seat us luckili famili bar wrap meal offer us seat mind sit bar took seat idea store hugo assum owner came explain dish us detail impress sinc dish eclect also extrem creativ hugo said live state work jose andr cool visit bazaar trip took lot suggest love everi dish especi enjoy calamari noth like usual fri calamari tapa bar famili also like pork skewer great cumin flavor honestli like everyth tri probabl could return anoth meal tri dish time hugo busi tend crowd alway made sure came check us throughout night great person realli enjoy chat realli room dessert tri two anyway sinc everyon els restaur mojito dessert refresh delici think look tradit tapa obvious place open mind would like tri invent tasti fun food come check place,very good review,5,Spanish

I've visited this lovely, quirky restaurant three times now and each time has left me feeling full and satisfied. The low lit and lively atmosphere complements the tasty and typically Spanish dishes, a choice between a variety of tapas and paella.  The menu offers the tapas dishes in two different sizes, 'tapa' and 'super tapa', depending on how hungry you're feeling! My boyfriend and I shared five tapas, all of different sizes, each was soo delicious! The teppanyaki tuna and the classic patatas bravas were a highlight for us. All of the staff are very friendly and chatty, in particular, Jordan was very helpful in recommending whether we had enough food between us or not along with very accommodating. As for the drinks, the sangria is rich with a fruity flavour and refreshing, good to share with a jug! I've also tried the homemade lemonade which I would definitely recommend if you're straying away from the alcoholic drinks. I would recommend to book if you're visiting in a group, especially at the weekends as it can get pretty busy, my boyfriend and I arrived without booking and were allocated a table in under 10 minutes at peak time!

A quick look on TripAdvisor lead us try Rosi La Loca and we’re glad we paid a visit! There were two of us and we ordered 5 tapas dishes which was just the right amount. The stand out was the smoked octopus. It came in a cloche that when lifted this mouth-watering smoke wafted out. Everything here was so well presented. The burrata was a delight.

I'm going to say that we got the table next to the door and my heart sank initially but once the friendly waiting staff got going we could not care less. I would have been happy eating on the pavement with the standard of food we got. We ordered a nice bottle of Albariño and settled in for one of the best meals I have ever had. We consider ourselves pretty spoiled with great food in Edinburgh (Scotland) but the imagination that this restaurant possesses surpasses anything we have in the UK in terms of value. Our second time to Madrid and our third time in this amazing restaurant. The waiting staff guided us through the menu and kept us in order to prevent the typical Brit idiots ordering too much. We had guacamole, foie gras, tuna tartar, deer carpaccio and grilled octopus. The octopus is in a rich creamy sauce so not for everyone but everything else was beautifully fresh and with incredible taste and presentation. A feast for two! We are booked for tomorrow night and cannot wait to try some of the other delicacies on the menu like the goats cheese starter and pigs ear. The waiting staff were great, please be patient initially, it is all well worth the wait. Very reasonable prices for the standard of food and also very reasonably priced and quality wine list.
