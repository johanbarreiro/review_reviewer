Staying in the neighborhood, our hotel suggested Le Entretenida, and we’re so happy they did. Arriving without reservations well into the evening, we were greeted warmly and shown a table towards the bar area. The atmosphere and ambiance was very nice - brick interior, tables with space around them, and a busy wait staff looking after patrons. Across the night, multiple staff members checked in on us - which was well appreciated. We were well taken care of across the evening. After ordering some drinks, we were welcomed with an amuse-bouche. It was a delightful potato soup with hints of cream. Very nice. For mains, the ladies went with paella and I ordered the salmon tartar, as unfortunately they were out of the tuna tartar. My tartar was very fresh, well-prepared and delicious. Salmon was fresh and mixed with nice flavors. Really good. And then the paella came - and it disappeared quickly! The ladies loved it, and as it was my daughter’s first paella, we weren’t certain she’d enjoy. But she loved it. The rice was creamy, and the seafood portions good across the dish. Along with some drinks and dessert for the little one, our evening was very enjoyable. We liked the atmosphere, the wonderful service, and the delicious offerings. My compliments to the entire team.

It seems to be a place for politicians and known people to see and be seen. Well I didn't see anyone I knew, but didn't find that a pity. The variety of the dishes, was as usual in Spain, also good in this place. We went for some starters to share, salpicon de mariscos, tostada de tomate con anchois and pulpo a la gallega. The anchois were indeed between the best I have ever eaten, but I don't consider that an achievement of the chef, because they come canned or anyway else ready prepared. The pulpo was rather good as well, soft and tender and not the chewy stuff that you get in many restaurants. However the salpicon de mariscos (seafood), something with which the chef could have shown that he indeed knows how to cook, was a complete failure. The shellfish was way overcooked, hard and mixed with practically no herbs or spices and a usual vinaigrette. This was chewy and not nice. As a main dish we ordered a turbot for four that was prepared as a whole fish. This is in my opinion one of the best ways to cook a fish, with some oil or butter in the oven. And as every chef knows the risk of overcooking is not to big this way, but this chef managed to get it much to hard and dry. The turbot was presented just cut in four quarters, with skin and side bones. I have eaten in many Spanish restaurants all over Spain, but this is a very unusual way to present such a nice fish and not appetizing as well.

As an American traveler, these are my top two sources after exhausting recommendations from friends. Unfortunately, the glowing reviews of this place could not be further from the truth. I generally do not care about bad service as long as the food is good, but this place falls flat on both fronts. Besides making multiple basic mistakes which I can fully forgive owing to cultural differences and language barriers, the service here was completely unacceptable. The first dish that we were served came with a large piece of styrofoam mixed into it. When I brought this to the attention of the nearest restaurant staff, they immediately brought it back to the kitchen and replaced it. However, that was the extent of their effort to make up for this egregious error which could have easily gotten someone very sick if they weren't carefully looking at what they were eating. This might be acceptable behavior if this were a below average restaurant in the middle of a tourist center where nobody actually cared because business is guaranteed. However, because of the fact that this place is so highly rated, expensive, and tries to be a fine dining establishment, what happened with the service is absolutely unacceptable and unforgivable even considering language and cultural barriers (for the record I have enjoyed every other restaurant in Spain I've been to so far and had no problems with either of these issues). Besides the service, the food was awful as well. We asked for and ordered the recommendations but all the seafood was very mushy and over cooked. The mussels in the seafood mix were smelly, the octopus was over cooked and mushy, the shrimp had the texture of paste, and the sea bream came with bones which we explicitly asked multiple times about before ordering. Everything was also too salty overall. The only redeeming quality was the waiter bringing the bread. He was completely on point and the bread was fine. The wine was pretty good as well and was completely necessary to wash down the food.  Overall this place is very overpriced and the service is worse than the other restaurants in Madrid that are not nearly as expensive. If you are a visitor here I would actively suggest avoiding this place since there are so many other better options for dining.",2017-10-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991774-Reviews-or40-O_Pazo-Madrid.html,UID_32066,0.083,0.8,0.117,0.9111,0.0356873582766439,0.4618891723356008,0.4628944444444445,2356,207,0.0878607809847198,0,37,False,73,0.0842105263157894,0.0736842105263157,0.2421052631578947,0.0421052631578947,0.1368421052631579,0.0631578947368421,0.0736842105263157,0.0631578947368421,0.1263157894736842,0.0947368421052631,402,238,4.8606965174129355,0,0,came see stellar review yelp trip advisor american travel top two sourc exhaust recommend friend unfortun glow review place could truth gener care bad servic long food good place fall flat front besid make multipl basic mistak fulli forgiv owe cultur differ languag barrier servic complet unaccept first dish serv came larg piec styrofoam mix brought attent nearest restaur staff immedi brought back kitchen replac howev extent effort make egregi error could easili gotten someon sick care look eat might accept behavior averag restaur middl tourist center nobodi actual care busi guarante howev fact place highli rate expens tri fine dine establish happen servic absolut unaccept unforgiv even consid languag cultur barrier record enjoy everi restaur spain far problem either issu besid servic food aw well ask order recommend seafood mushi cook mussel seafood mix smelli octopu cook mushi shrimp textur past sea bream came bone explicitli ask multipl time order everyth also salti overal redeem qualiti waiter bring bread complet point bread fine wine pretti good well complet necessari wash food overal place overpr servic wors restaur madrid nearli expens visitor would activ suggest avoid place sinc mani better option dine,very bad review,1,Spanish

Food is well done, and service is great. It was little strange when we first walk in with 6 of us that did not seem like we were too welcome by the Captain(i assume).  After we start ordering the wine, and somehow we clicked and things were all good afterward. I guess, it is a high end place in some way that we were so tourist like from HK could give a wrong impression. But all good after few minutes of work and i respect that.  I would recommend this place if you want seafood in madrid. It is on expensive side but still cheaper compare to some US and Asia Seafood Restaurant.

In Madrid for Father's Day weekend .. also happened to be my husband's birthday. Our hotel recommended a Vanvera so off we went. We arrived at opening -- overall, we found the service to be friendly. Chef did stop briefly at our table, but definitely did not pay the level of attention that I've read in other reviews. That high level of attention was given to people at tables surrounding us though. Started off with the burrata, which was promising. For mains, daughter ordered pomodoro, husband and I each ordered the spicy pork sauce, son ordered the truffled mushroom pasta. Ya'll know one important fact from reading my reviews: you can gauge the quality of an Italian chef simply by the quality of his basic pomodoro sauce. We didn't find anything redeeming in a single dish including the pomodoro. There was truffle in the mushroom sauce, but no salt, no follow through. (in fact, there was no salt or additional flavor in anything we ordered) The spicy pasta was well, spicy, by virtue of it being a spicy pasta .. no pork to be seen and the pomodoro was acidic. Tried to find redemption in the dessert; meh. Didn't even send us out the door with a limoncello. Two stars because we wouldn't return even to have dinner with friends.",2016-06-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5774304-Reviews-or30-A_vAnvera-Madrid.html,UID_19186,0.051,0.853,0.096,0.9058,0.0787394957983193,0.3614565826330532,0.2806,1394,113,0.0810616929698708,0,46,False,42,0.0833333333333333,0.1388888888888889,0.4444444444444444,0.0277777777777777,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.0277777777777777,247,167,4.647773279352227,0,0,anyon follow review know italian everywher go one disappoint italian experi awhil madrid father day weekend also happen husband birthday hotel recommend vanvera went arriv open overal found servic friendli chef stop briefli tabl definit pay level attent read review high level attent given peopl tabl surround us though start burrata promis main daughter order pomodoro husband order spici pork sauc son order truffl mushroom pasta ya know one import fact read review gaug qualiti italian chef simpli qualiti basic pomodoro sauc find anyth redeem singl dish includ pomodoro truffl mushroom sauc salt follow fact salt addit flavor anyth order spici pasta well spici virtu spici pasta pork seen pomodoro acid tri find redempt dessert meh even send us door limoncello two star return even dinner friend,bad review,2,Italian

We found it very welcoming, the food was good, (especially the squid) and the service was very friendly.  The prices certainly seemed very reasonable.  We also had a lovely selection of desserts. The ambiance was quite laid-back. There is a big TV on the wall in one section of the restaurant. My only gripe was the waiter's insistence on leaving our wine and water way out of reach, but my opinion may have been coloured by the dreadful day we had had before we got there, which demanded immediate access to wine! If I am in Las Huertas again this summer, I would certainly consider visiting this restaurant again. .",2015-01-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7283589-Reviews-or120-La_Entretenida-Madrid.html,UID_16820,0.075,0.839,0.087,-0.1815,0.0768622448979591,0.6492517006802722,0.4444285714285714,789,73,0.0925221799746514,1,21,False,29,0.1142857142857142,0.1428571428571428,0.1428571428571428,0.0571428571428571,0.1428571428571428,0.0571428571428571,0.0571428571428571,0.0571428571428571,0.1142857142857142,0.1142857142857142,142,103,4.549295774647887,0,0,flight uk delay bad weather walk restaur la huerta late saturday night without reserv hope would ok found welcom food good especi squid servic friendli price certainli seem reason also love select dessert ambianc quit laid back big tv wall one section restaur gripe waiter insist leav wine water way reach opinion may colour dread day got demand immedi access wine la huerta summer would certainli consid visit restaur,good review,4,Mexican

My only thing is that the truffle pasta could've used a little more garnish or something on the side to liven it up.

We were there early for Spanish dining and were warmly welcomed to this casual but elegant taverna and restaurant. We were served hot and fresh bread and complementary soup shots and a bowl of olives and pickled capers. We had grilled artichokes, a special appetizer for the day, the best I have ever eaten. They appeared as beautiful as they tasted - the hearts and inner leaves trimmed, choke removed so that at they looked like a flower- with olive oil and lightly grilled! We also had grilled mixed vegetables- perfectly cooked with a red pepper sauce on the side. We also shared rice with shrimp- done in a pan like paella, but with a light tomato and seafood based stock, a very generous serving and delicious. We just had a glass of the house red wine which was quite good. We were too full to order desert, and were just having cappuccino but were brought a luscious sherry (chocolate- like flavor) and a small serving of desert that we just couldn’t pass up. When we came in the restaurant just had a few tables in use, but by the time we left it was packed. Everyone that came in received the same warm welcome.

I bring all my visiting friends here after they have tried some Spanish food their first few nights. Everyone loves it.  It is basically gourmet pub food at a reasonable price in a very comfortable atmosphere with excellent service. What's not to like? I usually have the Buffalo Chicken Burger (good piece of chicken breast in a tasty spicy sauce) or the Falafel Burger (which comes with a nice ranch type sauce). You don't have to be just a hamburger lover to love this place, although my friends who eat burgers rave about it. Mad Cafe also uses purple onions for the onion rings and they are fantastic. I appreciate the fact that they get the importance of having decent lighting and good music on. Having a great meal at ""The Mad"" allows you to continue your night without being hungry. It is in a great area to go for drink before or after dinner.

I decided to visit this branch in Cava Baja as it is only a short walk from my flat here in Madrid.  We arrived at around 8.40pm, 10 minutes after they had opened. The waiter asked if we had a reservation, to which I said no. He then contemplated giving us a table (the restaurant only had two couples that were seated), after much deliberation he said we could have a table until 10pm which we took. I was quite disappointed with this welcoming as in Mad Grill the week before the waiter was SO nice and accommodating!  Anyways, we ordered nachos which were really good! We then ordered cheeseburgers with fries. Fries were really good, we both ordered our beef WELL DONE, and we got well done on the outside and raw pink in the middle. This was a huge disappointment.  Our waiter was also a tad impatient, not attentive and could not crack a smile.  We then ordered a brownie for dessert – this was superb! A proper brownie and the ice cream that accompanied it was good too! By this point we were given a much friendlier waiter who did smile and was very polite! He also asked us if we wanted a complimentary shot which was a lovely Spanish style Baileys! I also really like the atmosphere here too, full of couples or groups of friends..very pleasant!  All in all, the food was good (minus the mishap with the burgers). I would probably return just for the food as starter and dessert were very good!

So if you are to visit the restaurant in the evening, remember to reserve a table. The service was friendly and we felt welcome from the second we stepped into the restaurant. The place itself is a nice mixture of rustic, old bar and modern restaurant. They also feature nice collection of local and international beers, try them out! We ordered two bacon cheeseburgers that, to my mind, were good, but nothing special really. The meat was cooked well, but was left a bit tasteless.

I'm really into good burgers and very keen to sample the local places wherever I go. We ordered chicken wings for starters and burgers for mains. The chicken wings were surprisingly delicious and had a very authentic buffalo wings sauce on them. On the other hand, the burgers were not on par with the wings. The chili burger I ordered wasn't a burger with fresh chili or chili purée, but instead a burger with some chili con carneish minced meat sauce on top. And the sauce wasn't even slightly hot, it had more of a bland tomatoish taste to it. I suppose the beef and the bun were of decent quality but the huge amount of the chili con carne pretty much overwhelmed everything else on the dish.

We reserved (essential) for a Sunday afternoon at 2pm. Service was a mix of friendly and dry (we had two different waiters) but very efficient. The worst part of the experience was being seated by the staircase where I kept being bombarded by the smell of the bathroom fragrance spray. It was really unpleasant.  The menu is nice, prices are a bit high for what it is and I would've loved some non-alcoholic options that weren't sodas (homemade iced teas or lemonade, for example). But I had a decent glass of Rioja wine. The burgers were okay, cooked medium rare as we'd requested, and with a smoky charred outer crust (which I enjoyed, but my husband did not). The burger of the month had cabbage and Thai curry sauce-- the sauce was overbearing and would've been better with seafood. The fries were nice. For dessert we ordered the brownie, it was extremely dry, and the vanilla ice cream was just okay. 2 burgers, beer, glass of wine, one dessert and coffee for 39€. Not the best value in my opinion, given the overall experience. We were charged for an extra beer on our original bill, which they fixed since we noticed. Two shots of crema de orujo were given on the house, which is always appreciated.

We were greeted with rolls and a small plate of smoked salmon in lieu of butter. I spied one of my favorite rosé champagnes on the wine list at a very reasonable price so decided to splurge/economize on the Laurent Perrier at €68. That went down real easy…We started by sharing a half portion of jamon iberico, which was not quite so luscious as that in the sandwich I had the day before at Mercado San Anton, and a plate of anchovies de Santoña, which were superb, particularly on the pan con tomates (like a tomato pizza) which the waiter recommended as an accompaniment. Next was the biggest indulgence of the meal - two grilled caribeneros de Huelva, like the sweetest, juiciest langostines - even the roe was delectable; the pair weighed in at 345 grams and cost a steep €38 - cheap at twice the price. My daughter had sole (lenguado) as her main and I wild turbot (rodoballo salvaje) - wow! Why can't there be a fish restaurant this good in NYC? The only garnish was the very simple - and modestly priced at €2.50 - green salad with onions. We finished by sharing fillas rellenas de crema (the best crepes ever, stuffed with a decadent pastry cream) accompanied by a glass of solera that miraculously transformed into three through the wizardry of our waiter. The service was wonderful throughout the meal; the proprietor helped me to order and directed the very efficient, slightly shy, but friendly young English-speaking waiter our way. The room is elegant and restrained, and the noise level so civilized that I could even hear my daughter across the table.

In order to have a fine dining experience the service should match the quality of the food. We had the rudest most miserable head waiter.  We waited ages to be given a menu, customers who came in after us 'regulars/locals' were looked after before they even thought to see if we needed anything and were treated with a courtesy and a smile. When we did manage to get attention to order some drinks our wine was slopped into glasses and over my hand and later in the evening wine glasses taken away before we even finished our drinks.  You were ignored most of the time despite trying to get the waiters attention. This completely spoilt the experience. At the end of the service our credit cards were taken away which was weird due to the fact everyone else had a card reader bought to the table - we had to go and ask what was going on only to get a credit card chucked onto the table with 'no we don't accept this type of card'.

For me, Ali is the bait to come back and back many times when I am visiting Madrid. And now the restaurant.

The food is excellent Spanish cuisine. I usually have octopus or cod, both delicious. I recommend to come early, they are open all day.

It's a few minute walk from the hotel. We arrived shortly after 9pm on a Monday night and were prompty seated at this upscale eatery. The restaurant was sparsely occupied at the time and we had our choice of tables. We ordered many dishes to share for our first course... hamon and cheese platter, calamari, and spinach salad. Each was tasty. They also comped us two appetizer plates... one was like octopus pizza, the other was melted cheese on tomato and bread.

We had to ask for bread THREE times, which was finally delivered with our entree.

The food was quite nice and the waiter appeared embarrassed by the judgemental and pompous display from his, so called, senior. The food was OK. We ate a slightly over cooked but nicely presented spider crab and then ate a cooked sole. The level of competence was fine but not excellent. The tart de santiago was 'nice' and the chocolate mousse was OK, if a little too similar to a pre-made 'slam-it-in' and hope for the best restaurant shot-cut/time saver. The prices were certainly not reflected in the quality of the food or the unfortunate experience of meeting the 'head waiter'. But, we did have a laugh - at him.

They are very professional and really do know how to treat their diners. The staff is very knowledgeable, they are always willing to make recommendations once they understand what you are really looking for. Even though we were thinking of a more expensive wine following our order they recommended wines that were considerably cheaper but they believed they were a perfect match to our fish. Spot on. The food is superb. I do not need to go into detail to describe everything we had but everything was fresh and cooked in very simple way not to overpower the taste of the fish.

Thankfully they recommended La Entretenida, which was just around the corner. What a pleasant and welcome surprise! It was a chilly and damp late December evening and the restaurant itself was a beacon of light in a basically non-commercial area nearby. The restaurant was warm and pleasant and the staff very friendly and helpful. But what is a restaurant without good food - and La Entretenida's was terrific. My wife and I shared the terrine of foie gras with figs which was smooth and creamy - some of the best that we have ever had; the spinach salad with pine nuts, apple, and cheese was also excellent; and the main course of hake grilled with garlic butter that was served as a whole fish and split at the table was outstanding. And the waiter recommended a glass of local rioja wine which was perfect for the meal - a totally wonderful meal with excellent and helpful service.  And we went back the next evening to try the meat courses, which were also great. I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough for service, atmosphere and food.

If you are after an authentic performance of flamenco dance in an intimate setting (seats around 50) with passionate performers, then this may be the place for you. Located in a quiet suburban street near the Plaza del Torro de La Ventas, this place oozes passion. The performance (1 1/2 hours in total) consisted of 3 dancers, a singer and guitarist. In such an intimate venue there was no need for amplification. The dancers were fabulous and poured their heart and soul into their performances.

Readers should be aware that the restaurant has no kitchen but serves a few tapas, which are quite good and the portions are large. I booked through Tripadvisor and TheFork, which promised a 50% discount.

It is a beautiful, small and traditional Spanish taberna with friendly, helpful staff with a real passion for flamenco music. For Euro 35 each, we had a meal, drinks and watched the show which was absolutely fantastic value for money. We ate before the show - the food was fantastic and very tasty.

We found La Quimera and booked online at the last minute. It was a Sunday night and there was only one show, so we did not get the dinner option. But that didn't matter as we were mesmerized by the fabulous dancing and singing. There was one singer with a guitar and the seated dancers added percussion for whoever was performing. The establishment is fairly small, so everyone is seated close to the small stage and you feel the rhythm of the shoes tapping on the stage. The dancers (two men and one woman) were so passionate about their performances, it felt intimate and raw, not at all like a tourist show, but as though we had walked into someone's living room. The dancers were simply superb. We received a drink and appetizers with our admission. The show was just under an hour long, but very energetic and captivating.

Talk about the complete immersive Spanish cultural experience! We bought the tix that included one drink, which seemed like the best deal going of the top 3 shows in Madrid. We were seated pretty close to the stage and it seemed like the small setting did not really have a bad seat in the house. The show started at 10pm and went on for more than 1.5 hours.  The Flamenco group consisted of a guitar player, a female singer and three dancers, 2 female and 1 male. All of them were excellent and brought a level of intensity to their performance that just rocked the audience. The energy and skills demonstrated by the male dancer were over the top. The show pace increases with intensity all the way to the end, it was exhilarating to watch and to listen to. Very soulful. A great night to experience Spanish culture.

We travelled by taxi. Afterwards we just walked to the end of a street and easily picked up one to take us back. It was a small venue with a triangle stage in the corner. Dinner was basic but good quality. It consisted of the usual cheese and ham, followed by choice of main. I had moussaka just for something completely different. Pretty decent white wine too.  Besides we were here for the show and including dinner meant better seats. Our seats were great, one row back with a clear view.  The minimalist troupe absolutely looked authentic with a flamenco guitarist, a slightly possessed looking elder man, a rather handsome elder woman and good-looking young man and woman. The elder woman was the singer and she sounded soulful and passionate. The elder man was an amazing dancer and totally committed to his art, the passion almost consuming him at times. I was rather glad to be in the second row as the sweat was literally dripping off him with effort.  Flamenco is meant to be intimite and passionate and this show delivered on both accounts. We have booked to see a large ""professonal "" production in Barcelona so chose this as the other end of the spectrum.

Mad Café is my roommate's favorite (she LOVES burgers and fries). I have been here twice, once as a girls' night, and once on a date with my boyfriend. It is a fun place to have dinner because their burgers are delicious and big. Really good meat. Their carrot cake is also the best carrot cake I have had in Madrid. They have all kinds of fun beers, and their ambiance is great for a date. The nice thing is that it is right next to Cava Baja, where all the tapas bars are. So on a night out, my boyfriend and I went to Mad Café for a big dinner, and then we partied the night away with friends in Cava Baja. One little thing was that I asked for my meat well done, and it was not. I am not picky about how my meat is cooked, so it was not a problem for me.

There is only one waitress and she is quite kind though can not speak English. Me and my friend have been to Mad Cafe after reading so many good comments about it and wanted to try different burgers from their menu. We have tried 3 different burgers, nachos and a salad. To begin with, all the burgers were burnt. I wanted well done while my friend requested medium for the meat but unfortunately all were burnt. I do not remember the name but I tried the burger with duck breast on it and it was really bad. I strictly recommend you not to try this one. My friend liked his burger with extra cheese on it. We have also ordered nachos with guacamole sauce and it was really good on contrary to our expectations. We were expecting burgers to pop out but the best dish turned out to be the nachos. Keep in mind that portion of nachos is quite big, you will see how big is half portion in the pics below. Chicken salad was also bad because of the fish sauce on it. Yes, you heard me right, chicken salad had fish sauce on it and we did not like the combination of fish with chicken. You might like, I do not know.

We dined at La Entretenida and felt welcomed and comfortable. The decor at this restaurant is typically Spanish with a strong rustic look through thick stone walls decorated by thin wooden shutters. The menu is both comprehensive and appetising. The wine list equally provided ample choices and at reasonable prices. We were provided with appetisers of olives and bread, and choice of waters. Our entree was the grilled asparagus with Parmesan, which we shared. The asparagus were thick stalks and very nice. For our mains we selected the haute cuisine Cod fillet, with a thick sauce, and chicken with citrus and potatoes. Both meals were well presented and there were more than enough chicken pieces to satisfy any appetite. Our accompanying wine was a bottle of Spanish Verdejo which was perfect for our tastes.

There were 3 dancers, a singer and a guitarist, but I was mostly impressed by the dancing--extremely dynamic and breathtaking!  We went on a Thu without a reservation and we hardly got a table for 2 (only because there was a last minute cancellation), so do make a reservation ahead of time to make sure you'll get in. We paid 18 euros per person just for the show + a drink and we didn't have dinner in the tablao--quite frankly, I think the value is in the show, not in the food or service. Plus, it was way too crowded for my taste to have dinner during the show. Do go to see the performance--it's an unforgettable experience!

Our dinner was good, but not as good as the previous (or the next). We had a bowl of tiny chorizo and a bowl of dates wrapped in bacon (probably the best serving of the evening). There was some cured salmon with a tasty bit of cream cheese-like topping on a bit of bread, also good. A fresh and hot tortilla with cheese and potatoes arrived. It was good, but wasn't as tasty as the one from the night before. There also was a plate of several cheeses with mango jam. It all added up to more than enough food. The dinner and show cost 31€ and included a large glass of red wine. Nonetheless, we added another bottle for the table of five for an additional 20€, bringing the total to about $45 per head for dinner and a show. We took cabs to get here as it would have been quite a walk. A ten minute cab ride cost us a mere 10€.

We came in there just after 9pm being the first with another couple. 15 minutes later the doors opened and People flooded in occupying every table - so make sure you have a Reservation. The menu itself wasn't the best looking, a lot of fine print you would rather see in a take-away. But available also in english. We decided to drop the menu and just follow the recommendations. We Chose three courses: red giant prawns a la plancha, bacalao (cod) with 2 sauces and Lobster Rice.  An ""Amuse geule"" was served with Bread and we had to mention that we would not go for meat or wheat. They reacted in seconds: there is gluten free bread and the ""chistorra starter"" was replaced by an absolutely delicate fish ceviche. This is an outstandingly positive reaction and I have never seen anything that quick in Spain before. The recommended Albarinho was amongst the best that I have tasted so far (and I am collecting them). Although I believe you can eat everything in there, the Loster was crunchy and sweet at the same time, while the Rice came in just as spicy as it should. You'll easily end up at 200 EUR or more, but it is woth every penny. With such a caring, quick and perfect Service plus outstanding Food and wine, I'd pay more if they just keep that Level.",2015-09-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697585-Reviews-or30-Goizeko_Wellington-Madrid.html,UID_32339,0.023,0.807,0.171,0.9925,0.3309974747474747,0.5396254208754209,0.3135615384615384,1323,117,0.0884353741496598,0,36,False,49,0.2105263157894736,0.2105263157894736,0.2631578947368421,0.0526315789473684,0.1578947368421052,0.0,0.0,0.0526315789473684,0.0526315789473684,0.0,242,171,4.466942148760331,0,0,wife stay wellington came pm first anoth coupl minut later door open peopl flood occupi everi tabl make sure reserv menu best look lot fine print would rather see take away avail also english decid drop menu follow recommend chose three cours red giant prawn la plancha bacalao cod sauc lobster rice amus geul serv bread mention would go meat wheat react second gluten free bread chistorra starter replac absolut delic fish cevich outstandingli posit reaction never seen anyth quick spain recommend albarinho amongst best tast far collect although believ eat everyth loster crunchi sweet time rice came spici easili end eur woth everi penni care quick perfect servic plu outstand food wine pay keep level,very good review,5,Spanish

As others have noted, it's not a modern trendy restaurant, but rather an elegant, slightly more formal dining room though the service and the feel were relaxed and cozy. Waitress was friendly and accommodating. Tuna tartar with herring caviar was delicious, spiked with shallots and garlic. We enjoyed trying the traditional baby eels dish, Angulas a la bilbaína, and were pleased also to find that the dishes could be ordered in 1/2 portions, so we were able to try several things to share.

Like much of Madrid it seems a bit overly formal compared to the rest the world but the place had warmth. The staff while at first a bit stiff warmed to conversation and gave us some wonderful advice about a very diverse and some what foreign cuisine. Most notable was the lack of noise in the place which was such a plus to fine dining.  We sampled a puréed soup concoction with a touch of bacon, half portions of ceviche which is not basque, clams and artichokes. We had Cod in an extraordinary green sauce made from fish skin, garlic and parsley. The bread and olive oil were all first rate. We were surprised with a delicious dessert of Basque pastry and chocolate truffles Our clams were the only thing not to our liking, this is not a good thing. The wine, a Granacha, was reasonable and excellent. The wait staff were first rate. By My standard I thought the meal was reasonable and excellent.

We started with a glass of wine at the bar before moving on to the restaurant. We thought we would go with main course and dessert however we still had a delicious aperitif of Tuna in a pastry slice. For main course we had the tenderloin of beef which was cooked to perfection with a side of green salad. As a dessert I went for the apple pastry which judging by the smile on the waiter I knew was a good choice. To accompany the food we had a bottle of the Rioja which was excellent. To cap it off the piano player in the lounge started playing which just added to the evening.

We wanted to have a late lunch after checking in at a nearby hotel. The host was extremely polite and welcoming. He promptly sat us at a coffee table with club chairs- not a dining table. I was a bit confused initially as I had told him that we were there for a meal, but the table felt as though it belonged in a club (more for drinks).Hey assured us that it was possible in fact to order food from where we had been sitting. Upon looking at the menu, we realized that the menu featured many different alcoholic beverages and snacks(appetizers), rather than actual food. Nonetheless, we decided we would just have drinks and then go elsewhere for a meal. We sat there for over 10 minutes, and no one came to take our drink order. The 2 to 3 servers we did see stayed in the back of the room attending to the other parties Who had in fact ordered from the lunch buffet which had closed already.  A server only came by when he saw us getting up and gathering our things to leave. When he approached us he said, ""Do you want to order something?""

It fit the bill wonderfully on all fronts! Under the beautiful, stain-glass dome in the center of The Palace Hotel, La Rotonda is an awesome place to dine, have an afternoon coffee, or an evening glass of Cava or wine. The Palace Hotel was built in 1912 and has been an institution ever since. Across the street from Spain's Congress Building and the Prado right on the Plaza de las Cortes, it's in the epicenter of Madrid. La Rotonda is open virtually all day. For breakfast, they do a huge hot and cold buffet, and will make you eggs any way you want them. The fruit is fresh and the coffee is hot! We did just breakfast and dinner every day in Madrid because we had such a great option for breakfast (eg no lunch required). Breakfast Buffet is open from 7am to 11am. On Sunday's, they do an Opera Brunch from 1:30pm to 4pm. Today, we had a beautiful Soprano and a tuxedo-clad Tenor, both with amazing voices that filled the dome and magically bounced around delightfully! They were accompanied by an excellent Pianist on a Grand Piano. Fantastic way to spend a rainy, cold Sunday afternoon in Madrid! The day we arrived from Seville, after a long day of driving and touring, we decided to grab a quick dinner at La Rotonda. My wife had a 4 Euro Dinner Salad, I had a 9 Euro bowl of Minestrone Soup, and we split a Spaghetti Bolognase for 15 Euros. Everything was delicous! Salad was fresh, the Minestrone outstanding, and the Spaghetti substantial, nicely spiced, and with lots of meat! It totally fit the bill! Most Hotels, even beautiful one's like The Palace, don't have a restaurant on-site of this caliber.

It is always very busy at night time so you need to get there reasonably early and be prepared to wait for a table especially if you are in a large group.

The atmosphere is always great and the food fantastic. We usually get a selection of things between us all to share.

How could this be so peaceful when its just a few hundred yards from main roads, 5 minutes from the Palace and Cathedral? The square was bathed in sunlight on this September day and there were a number of cafes/restaurants with plenty of tables outside. This was a Sunday lunchtime and there seemed to be families and friends enjoying lunch, reading the papers...just relaxing! I then noticed the signs which confirmed that the establishments in the square (Plaza de la Paja) had worked together to stop buskers and other 'entertainers' disturbing the peace (no wonder it was quiet!). La Musa caught my eye - one of many restaurants - and I had a pleasant lunch. The menu (written in the form of a newspaper, with each 'article' giving different selections of food) gave a variety of tapas dishes. Remember you're in the heart of Spain, not a holiday resort, and many places only have menus in Spanish - so a phrase book (or translation app on your phone) will come in handy The tempura prawns were delightful, with thirst quenched by an ice cold beer. So the food was good - the location and atmosphere made the occasion. I'd love to go back there.

We had been served our first bottle of wine & the olives when another table opened up that could seat us more comfortably. The food was so good, I would not have had a problem staying at our original table. We ordered chicken & salmon tostas, the manchengo cheese was delicious. The portions were very good & we ended up ordering a 2nd bottle of wine! My nephew had not experienced authentic tapas on a college student budget. However the prices were good, very well priced for the quality of food & the service. My husband ordered a port for my nephew & himself.

Having visited 150+ restaurants, I think we have gained a good feel for the food, service and price for good meal in Spain.  Unfortunately, this restaurant did not live up to the majority of the reviews posted. I always say “beware of reviews from people that have never posted before”. A lot of first time reviewers on this one. I have to say the poor reviews were fairly accurate. The service was incredibly slow. It took 45 minutes to get our appetizers. There was such a long time between seeing our waitress that we were pouring our own wine. No apology or explanation from the staff as to why it was taking so long. The place was pretty empty (only 2 other tables and one of them arrived after us) so it was not The food eventually did come. The soups were “okay” extremely over salted. We all got fish for the main course. It was fairly bland. We debated as to whether to bother with desert then figured that we would share the chocolate ecstasy.

What drove me to choose this place was it offered 30% off our food bill as advertised by The Fork, if we decide to seat on 13 July at 7:30pm (I guess it is to encourage patrons to dine earlier so they can get more turns of table to maximise revenue). The restaurant serves modern version of Spanish tapas, and has a limited wine list. However, it exceeded our expectations as the food and desserts were so good, yes, every dish is excellent! The service is a tad slow (as in with most restaurants in Madrid), and maybe because we were early, and there was only one server/wait person to the whole restaurant. It wasn’t busy at the time we were there from 7:30 to 9:30pm. We asked for our bill and there was no discount on our bill. I asked the wait person and later the manager, but they said The Fork didn’t inform them of the 30% discount as advertised. We were happy with the food, the value (it was not expensive - about €30pp with dessert, wines, beer) and overall experience we didn’t haggle and we even gave a tip.  I have written to The Fork, and am awaiting their reply.  But, I want to thank and say kudos to El_b_US for such a lovely meal and experience for our last night in Madrid!

I go there at least once a week, whether it is for their excellent coffee, quality artisanal beer or fresh food, its always a wonderful time. The food is excellent, always very fresh and it won't break the bank. I love the hummus, my boyfriend loves the salmon tosta (their guacamole is great as well). But the best part of El B_us by far is their customer service! I would say that in general customer service in Spain is not very good but at El B_us they treat all of their customers like friends. All of the staff is super friendly and relaxed. The reason why I first started going is because I had their olives (I am an olive fiend) that they bring with drinks, they know us now and always treat us incredibly well.

A symbolic sharing space for cooperative business, with special detail given to its luminous decoration offering authentic art and creativity; where you are free to purchase something of interest to add to your home. Industrial in its design, quality artisan beers, creative food with excellent value for money, offering superb wines ranging from red to white (especially the Martivilli) and great background music!! Something you rarely see appreciated through-out the city, with so many empty franchises lacking in such charm. A local joint with its own distinctive personality, ranging from its choice of breakfast, lunch or dinner, to a timeout cup of coffee while you browse the internet on your laptop, up until a few last drinks to finish the evening. If you’re looking for a pleasurable experience, this place won’t fail to disappoint.

We were unable to get into any of the better known restaurants and got a table a Posada de la Villa which was a short walk from where were were staying.  We were greeted by very professional staff and although we had not booked, were shown to a lovely table upstairs.  The restaurant was lovely, the staff were superb and the hospitality was excellent with some lovely and unexpected amuse bouches.  I love roast lamb and I have to say our lamb fell short of my expectations. It was very lamby but devoid of any other flavours that would have elevated it into something special, ie, salt, a handful of herbs, anchovies, anything.... It wasn’t a bad meal but not as good as I was expecting, especially for the price.

We had not booked a table, but she said that there would be one ready soon, so we were sat down in a sofa. We ordered a predinner drink, and 5 minutes later we sat by the table.

It’s a very traditional menu but generally a lot better than your average Spanish restaurant. I have tried a few different things from the menu but my definitely favourite is the leg of lamb (cordero). It’s so juicy that and yummy that on it’s own would make any dinner a great experience. Don’t forget to check out the massive oven that they have on the ground floor that they cook it in. They have a very extensive wine list and if you’re not familiar with Spanish wine then the waiters are happy to help otherwise you can just go for the house wine which is Marques de Riscal Reserva.

We were told that the lamb dish here was fantastic. Having checked on Trip Advisor this appeared to be confirmed. The dining room itself has probably remained unaltered for several decades and the demeanour of the staff reflected the surroundings. If you enjoyed pretentious dining in the seventies this is the place for you. We ordered the lamb which came within ten minutes and served at the table with great fanfare it was tasteless and not much of it. We had two glasses of house wine one beer and one ice cream. Cost 100 euros. It would not have been cheap at half the price.

Weren't quite sure when we got there as it was very quiet and quite a small menu. Not exactly tapas. Our server suggested one dish to share and one each as a main. That turned out to be good advice. Only a fairly limited set of dishes - maybe 12 - and 4 or so of them were raw fish or raw meat, which we didn't fancy. We did find three things we liked the look of though and all three were delicious. Good wine menu and we found a very reasonably priced (Euro 15) white Rioja which we enjoyed. Apple and avocado salad to start was perfect and the rissotto was also lovely. Service was excellent and the two young ladies who looked after us did a marvellous job. Extra bonus, I'd forgotten when I booked on the fork that it was 50% of all food so the bill was a pleasant surprise.

It is above and connected to the bar of the hotel. The manager was very accommodating. Explained that we would get a 30% discount as hotel guests. TripAdvisor's offer of 50% off for booking on line was not available. The dining room is casual, with all hard surfaces so likely to get quite noisy later in the evening but at 8 pm we were the only ones there. Gratis appetizer was a tray of wonderful Marconi almonds and two tiny squares of nice cheese. We shared a lettuce and cooked vegetable salad which was forgetable. My husband had grilled pork with mushrooms and I had three modest sized pieces of steak that were marvelous. The steak cut had to be filet mignonette because it was butter tender and without any sign of fat marbling. The sauce was heaven: a port truffle sauce that was clear, superb in flavor and artfully done. Accompanying my steak were 3 pieces of potato cut in the shape of thick French fries and uninteresting. Also with the steak they served what they called ""ravioli"" which was a piece of beef bone marrow wrapped in puff pastry dough and very greasy. Dessert was a chocolate volcano cake with very high quality molten chocolate in it and a tiny scoop of ice cream. Delicious. Followed by complimentary sweets of lacy almond cookies and small chocolates. The cost was reasonable with the discount but full price would not have been worth it.

From start to finish, everything we ate was exceptionally well prepared, and served by a most pleasant and friendly wait staff and maitre'd. We began with gazpacho, which was a light, velvety texture, accompanied by an array of fresh chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and onions that the waiter spooned into the bowl. The flavor was mld and heavenly from the first bite to the last. We also had the garlic shrimp, served sizzling hot, with razor thin slices of fresh garlic. The shrimp were melt-in-your mouth tender. For mains we had the roast lamb, which was fall-off-the bone tender, served with a delicate jus, and the hake casserole-- a large portion of tender flakey fish with a luscious white wine sauce, with potato, asparagus and tomato. Again, the light touch of seasoning allowed the natural fresh flavors and beautiful moist texture of the fish to shine through. The dessert sampler showed similar skill in preparation, with creamy, flakey textures and hints of sweet. The meal also included several nice touches -- yummy croquettes; mild green olives; and fresh rustic bread. You should note that this restaurant is expensive by local standards. Our meal came to 115e, including 3 glasses of wine and an espresso, but the overall dining experience was well worth the price, and without question this was by far the best food we have eaten in Madrid.

Our waitress went above and beyond to make sure we had a nice dining experience. Because I have an allergy to tree nuts I had very few options for my meals, which is no one's fault, of course, just disappointing. To their full credit and to my great appreciation, the restaurant had a full allergy sheet which was exceptionally helpful and the kitchen staff made substitutions where they could.  We ordered the carrot soup with scallops. The scallops were perfect but the soup was far too salty to eat. The waitress insisted on bringing another pitcher of soup which was less salty. The tiramisu was nothing great, unfortunately. The sangria was very tasty. I think there are probably too many amazing places to eat in Madrid that I probably would not go to this restaurant again.

When we ordered our waitress, Amanda, was sowell versed in English that she actually understood our order when we said we wanted our steak charred on the outside, medium rare on the inside. She got it just right. I had even requested a substitute for the ravioli and asked for a vegetable instead - no problem. Many restaurants can't handle anything different from what the menu is offering. This place was magnificent and we plan to go back again before we leave.

The decor is different in that the smallish dining area is surrounded by a variety of Marilyn Monroe pictures. The tables are reasonably separated and we felt comfortable in dining here. The service was of a high standard and very attentive. The menu is not extensive but covered a range of meals from hamburgers to more traditional mains like Sirloin Steak, pork and Chicken. The wine list provides reasonable choice at good prices. We enjoyed a Spanish Verdello White bottle at 12 euros.  We started dinner with an 8 lettuce salad which was a good serving and adequate for both of us. It was fresh and tasty. My main was the Sirloin steak, which was cooked perfectly to my liking, supported by a small number of potato chips and bone marrow in a light pastry. The marrow was a little beyond my tastes but I did have half the serve. The quality of the steak was a standout! The other main was the pork fillet which was also cooked as required, tender and very nice. The sauce was a delight in roast capsicum and tomato. The accompaniment was potato wedges.  Overall the meals were delicious, not overly large but the mains would need other vegetables, unless a salad, or like starter, was not ordered with or before the mains.  Value for money is very good.

All 3 dishes were great. After our meal our waiter asks if we wanted dessert, and after reviewing the offerings we asked him which was his favorite. He said the carrot cake so we tried it and it was delicious! After we asked or our check our waiter brought us a couple chip like things that were covered in crushed almonds and honey, and also a couple small truffles, both which are made right on the premises.

With impeccably attired, attentive personnel, Posada has created an ambiance with prominent signs of traditional, prosperous furnishings and finesse as far as Spanish historical culture goes. Their wall display of antique, perfectly polished copper pots, pans and kitchen ornaments leaves the good observer with a lasting impression. Their menu is equally overwhelming in the broadest sense: traditional dish diversity that raise the bar of gastronomic expectancies. Obviously, visit this restaurant without budget concerns since there is no such thing as a fixed priced 'daily menu'. You will select options 'a la carte' at their regular, steep prices. Thus we wanted to try their in-house, huge oven cooked leg of lamb for two (€49.) in addition to grilled bass, a regular salad and sparkling, bottled water ( no wine). Since our 'group' was composed of two couples, we gently asked our waiter to slice the lamb and bass in four pieces, and to prepare our salad, which he gracefully and willfully did. In sum, our experience was highly satisfactory with all its components: interior environment, courteous, amicable service and food confections. But remember, this is a 'traditional' , spain fare restaurant. No avant-garde gourmet items are served but, instead, no-nonsense, hearty dishes, including some ancestral types of desserts, great service, elegant atmosphere and an equally robust bill can be expected. As my good friend would say, a place to dine as a recognition of your well deserved, dedicated life.

We had 2 main meals, sea bass and spaghetti in a truffle and cream sauce. The seas bass was raw and had to be sent back. The only thing it came with was some ratatouille type vegetables. The spaghetti was decent enough but not a huge bowl. The price for this was 24 euros for the fish and 18 euros for the spaghetti. But wait, they then add on the tax, because in the menu it states that the prices are less tax. So add another 10%! 26 euros for undercooked fish, 2 small pieces, with a bit of veg and 20 euros for spaghetti in cream sauce!

This was the sort of comfort we needed. The warmth of welcome was impressive. This is a very large space which can accomodate large groups and intimate dining experience.  The sommelier, unusually, recommended the house wine, which was quite extraordinary. A wine grown on the outskirts of Madrid. Who knew? We ordered a couple of entrees of croquettes and snails, which were exemplarary. Then the highly recommended lamb lag for two for the chaps - and the deer for my dearest.  The lamb had been charred and cooked on a spit - and you know tender when the waiter, serving it charmingly at the table, rather theatrically pulls it apart with two spoons.  It was fabulous and extremely generous in portion. Served simply with some sautéed potatoes. It needed nothing else.  The atmosphere was wonderful.

It was a very pleasant finding. The atmosphere in the restaurant was great, seemingly a lot of groups of local people mixed with smaller groups of tourists like ourselves. We arrived around 8 o'clock and got a table straight away but as we we ate our meal we noticed some parties having to wait briefly for a table.  The staff were very attentive and efficient.  The food was very good with amazing flavours and the presentation was very nice as well.

We had passed the stop on our way back to our hotel, and were intrigued by the decor and menu variety. However, we were not graced with the privilege to experience the food, as the instant greeting by the East 47 staff was enough for us to refuse to stay. It took approximately 43 seconds after we sat down to decide to dine elsewhere. The immediate chill we received when we walked can possibly be described as reminiscent of what an early 19th century plantation owner would direct to one of his slaves. We were acknowledged by the waitress, but nothing as to whether we would like to sit, whether we were having dinner, whether we would like to have a drink, etc. Seemingly uncomfortable, we waited a moment for some type of professional service, but to no avail. My mother was curious as to the seating upstairs, and began to climb the staircase to check out the second floor. It was then that the manager or host (not a term well-deserved), flagrantly stormed out of nowhere and berated my mother to come off the stair. We inquired about dinner; he demanded whether we had a reservation. We were a bit put off as it was 10:30 p.m. and there were about 6 out of the 8 or so tables in the lower dining room empty. When we said no as to the reservation, he begrudgingly pointed to the back of the restaurant and said we ""could sit there."" Dinner service being over at 11:00 p.m. was mentioned as he surveyed his watch, although it clearly stated on the menu posted outside the door it was 11:30 p.m.  I have to apologize, as my review is based solely on our experience at the front of the house. However, I had worked service industry for over 10 years, have traveled all over the world, and I am now a working professional with a major respect for the dining experience. There was no possible way my mother and I would have been able to sit and enjoy that meal after the greeting. Although initially attractive, East 47 melted away into a tacky uber - trash establishment with knock-off Warhols to boot, and a maniac for a manager at the helm. On the other hand, I do thank East 47 for their brash attitude, in that our decision to leave led us to an incredible dinner down the street. As for East 47, they would be wise to follow few key pieces of advice: -Don't yell at your potential customers, nor degrade them. They are likely more educated and make more money than you do.  -A hostess would be appropriate if you can't handle greeting guests yourself. -If you would not like people to wander into certain parts of the dining room, or if a particular area is reserved, roping it off or putting up a sign is what any normal establishment would do. People aren't normally mind - readers about these things. All in all, East 47 just needs to get it together.

They did promote their signature dish which was the lamb. We weren't disappointed - very simply presented but very tasty. The only thing that would have made the meal better would have been a selection of veg to go with the meat. It was my partners 50th, which we were able to communicate and they presented us with desert complete with a candle. My partner proposed - I accepted and they had noticed this. When we were leaving they presented us with a small pot with the name of the restaurant and 2 small keys to represent the keys to the restaurant. I thought it was a wonderful gesture.

On Cava Baja St., the Inn dates from 1642 and was restored in 1980. You enter and are immediately greeted by a host and the large wood-fired oven on the first floor. House specialty is roast lamb and it definitely was special. Two of us shared an order for ""one"". A serving for two is on the menu and they will happily downsize it for ""one"". We also had the Roast Red Peppers “Piquillo”. They're not just oven roasted peppers. Absolutely tasty. The wine list is extensive. Not knowing so much about Spanish wines, we tried the house wine, which turned out to be a fabulous hearty red blend. I'm not a ""wine snob"" but I do have my preferences, and this was a really good wine. We ended up buying a bottle to bring home. Service was top notch! Presentation was special too linen, beautiful place settings, fresh flatware/dinnerware for all courses, etc. I thought the meal was a bargain, and it truly was. A couple blocks from Plaza Mayor, streets were crowded with cafes and people, not a sketchy area at all in my opinion. This restaurant made our last night in Madrid absolutely special.

I would not be surprised if they make meat in microwave. 2) You think that waiter should come to you ASAP once you raise hand in the fully empty restaurant? - You are wrong, he urgently needs to take out all dishes out of dishwasher. Only after this important action he will be able to serve you in an empty restaurant. 3) You think that employees of the restaurant should be more quiet that guest? Oh, you are very-very wrong, it is ok to scream and laugh all over the restaurant. Overall, ""restaurant"" is 1-star. As we understood, kitchen is the little corner in the main room: there is one oven and three microwaves - all our dishes was prepared there, of course they were not fresh. Unfortunately, tripadvisor was wrong in this case.",2015-09-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6641622-Reviews-or70-El_b_Us-Madrid.html,UID_32675,0.116,0.812,0.073,-0.7837,0.0157986111111111,0.5975694444444445,0.2467666666666667,1036,92,0.0888030888030888,0,38,False,30,0.032258064516129,0.032258064516129,0.2580645161290322,0.1290322580645161,0.1612903225806451,0.032258064516129,0.032258064516129,0.064516129032258,0.1935483870967742,0.064516129032258,183,115,4.666666666666667,0,0,lunch restaur empti thought think prepar mussel microwav possibl restaur think differ fulli normal cours receiv fresh mussel menu receiv bake microwav mussel would surpris make meat microwav think waiter come asap rais hand fulli empti restaur wrong urgent need take dish dishwash import action abl serv empti restaur think employe restaur quiet guest oh wrong ok scream laugh restaur overal restaur star understood kitchen littl corner main room one oven three microwav dish prepar cours fresh unfortun tripadvisor wrong case,very bad review,1,French

Now for the so called fantastic food.....our garlic soup was nothing more than water with fat and garlic swimming in it and a poor forlorn egg floating around....no taste no flavour no presentation....and please note it costs 9 euros then the famous black pudding was more white then black with thick clogs of fat that initially i tought were rice. My wine glass was horrendously chipped and not once we were approched by any of the staff to see if all was well. The local patrons seemed better deserving of the attention of this rude man. We skipped seconds and left half the sangria(watery) there. Instead of finding understanding and maybe assistance when we complained about the food we were looked down upon and treated like we were idiots.

The croquettes and olives which we were given upon seating were delicious, and the Jamon Iberico which we ordered for a starter was literally sublime the best i have ever tasted, and the fresh asparagus we also ordered were cooked to perfection. For our main course we wanted to try the cordero asado as it is their speciality but we were told that they had sold out, so the maitre reccommended we try their chuletas de cordero instead which were absolutely delicious. I would also recommend their house wine, i was amazed when the maitre recommended it, as I was expecting him to say a more expensive bottle, but when we tried it we could see why, a great accompanyment to a great meal. For dessert we tried both the Cheescake and the Mil Hojas which both came highly reccomended, and if i had to pick the better of the two, at a push i would go with the pastry. Our maitre then offered us a drink on the house and we accepted a Pacharan each, which having tasted quite a few i can say was without doubt the best i have ever tasted. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very warm and welcoming, and we found the service and food exceptional, i especially liked the little Key they give you upon leaving instead of a business card, quite a unique and brilliant little touch, especially when the maitre tells you that it is the key to your house and you can use it whenever you like.

I have to say that when we first walked in we were measured head to toe in regards to what we were wearing (mind you we didn't have a suit on, but we were dressed casually in jeans). The staff had a very snotty air about them, but I didn't care just wanted to have a great meal.  We were seated upstairs in a very rustic & cool room. Their table standards are olives & bread with butter. Olives were amazing & bread was warm & fresh. Really great.  So after looking at the menu I had picked a main & a backup entree (Bull Tail which I heard was amazing, melted in your mouth & a traditional meal & was dying to have it or the Cured Pork Tenderloin (they always have pork in Spain)) Well surprised surprised they didn't have either which was like WHAT? You don't have Pork in the restaurant that charges an avg of $34 per entree? (money was obviously not an issue - it's just the reputation & ambiance they are obviously trying to portray).  So I was stuck with just picking the Steak Loin - NOW first to save this review I have to say it was THE best steak I've ever had, fatty enough to seriously get the most flavor & it came on a sizzling ceramic plate that continued to cook your meat or keep it warm depending on where you positioned the meat. It was very interesting & my steak was done perfectly to my liking.  It was delicious. And then for desert I had a wonderful thing called ""Fried Milk"" - had the consistency of hard custard, vanilla & cinnamon flavor - I'm sure extremely fattening but really tasty.  So overall the food was amazing, service was very snotty & indifferent (couldn't get a smile out of the staff no matter how charming & friendly we tried to be) and just disappointed that I couldn't actually eat what I really wanted.  And the kicker...we didn't even go late to dinner when most Madridians go which is around 10pm...we went at the start around 8 so it's not like they could have ran out. But it's a popular dish so you would think they would stock up no???",2010-05-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d896751-Reviews-or280-Posada_de_la_Villa-Madrid.html,UID_32685,0.056,0.735,0.209,0.9979,0.2895833333333332,0.5946338383838384,0.4523529411764707,2072,188,0.0907335907335907,0,75,False,68,0.0454545454545454,0.1212121212121212,0.2878787878787879,0.0909090909090909,0.1515151515151515,0.0606060606060606,0.0606060606060606,0.0303030303030303,0.0757575757575757,0.0757575757575757,394,233,4.243654822335025,0,0,heard place rick steve travel guid madrid said say first walk measur head toe regard wear mind suit dress casual jean staff snotti air care want great meal seat upstair rustic cool room tabl standard oliv bread butter oliv amaz bread warm fresh realli great look menu pick main backup entre bull tail heard amaz melt mouth tradit meal die cure pork tenderloin alway pork spain well surpris surpris either like pork restaur charg avg per entre money obvious issu reput ambianc obvious tri portray stuck pick steak loin first save review say best steak ever fatti enough serious get flavor came sizzl ceram plate continu cook meat keep warm depend posit meat interest steak done perfectli like delici desert wonder thing call fri milk consist hard custard vanilla cinnamon flavor sure extrem fatten realli tasti overal food amaz servic snotti indiffer get smile staff matter charm friendli tri disappoint actual eat realli want kicker even go late dinner madridian go around pm went start around like could ran popular dish would think would stock,average review,3,Spanish

We waited till we got to Madrid and asked a desk clerk at our hotel, the Best Western Atlantico, to book us a table.. None was available, she said, but she could get us into Posada de la Villa -- a restaurant that claims to have been in business since 1642, or more than a century longer than Botin. We took the metro from Gran Via and, with the aid of a map, easily found the restaurant. It's on a charming, short, and narrow street with several other restaurants, many shops, and a boutique hotel under construction. We were promptly ushered to our table -- the whole restaurant appears to be 'smoking, yes' -- and immediately offered aperitifs.

Instead of a warm greeting, my wife and I were met by a Maitre D', very full of himself, who looked annoyed, muttered something and gestured that we should wait out of the way, over by the door. After a few minutes, we were escorted upstairs and seated. Overall, a nice looking place. Their specialty , grilled meats. The appetizers were forgettable and small, but expensive, i.e., $23 euro for about 8 tiny shirmp in olive oil. For mains, I ordered the veal chop, my wife had rice with rabbit. For a place specializing in grilled meats, I was shocked with the quality and size of the veal chop; thin, very chewy with not a trace of flavor. The rice with rabbit is appropriately named, mostly rice with two, count 'em, two pieces of rabbit bone with a few strings of meat (was it really rabbit-?). The red wine was good and the basket of bread (4 slices) was 1.50 euro. After the waiter took our order, he was off, bowing and scraping with much fanfare to the Spanish speaking patrons, leaving our table service and check transaction to the underling bus staff. I made several attempts to catch his eye, to no avail. He didn't even come back to see if we wanted coffee and dessert (we didn't). The total bill was 113 euro, we left no tip. This was the most expensive meal we had in Madrid and without a doubt the worst overall dining experience we had in our 8 days in Spain, (possibly in all my years of travelling). Needless to say, it was a rip-off. They knew we would probably never return and treated us accordingly!

I did like the side order of grilled root vegetables, but the artichoke hearts appetizer were so overcooked that it was like eating baby food.",2016-02-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4358449-Reviews-or40-Ganz-Madrid.html,UID_32714,0.043,0.778,0.179,0.9449,0.2090909090909091,0.4954545454545455,0.4568,509,46,0.0903732809430255,0,13,False,21,0.0625,0.25,0.375,0.125,0.1875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,95,74,4.368421052631579,0,0,nice place good servic food averag main cours hake undercook fill bone flavorless sauc season bit salt one want come nice restaur pick bone mouth sever time hake realli hard chef fillet switch salmon like side order grill root veget artichok heart appet overcook like eat babi food,average review,3,Greek

Blink and you'll miss it, which would be a pity. Very charming decor with white porcelain birds and African-ish statuettes with willow branches, window seats, distressed mirrors, and a checkerboard flow create a fun, whimsical atmosphere and somehow all these elements go together. And the food was top notch! For starters we had the artichokes with ham salt and the chili paste w/octopus with egg and potato. The latter sounds really odd to the American palate, but trust me, somehow these favors all work together, like the eclectic decor.

We searched around the neighborhood for anything different, then of course compared reviews. I am so glad we found this little treasure.  The service was excellent and the food was even better. We started with an arugula (rocket) salad with poached pears. We then split the duck and the scallops. The portions are just perfect and we left pleasantly full but not stuffed (even after we added in some of the best cheesecake I've ever had). The setting was quite romantic as well, though still overall casual.  Well worth it!
