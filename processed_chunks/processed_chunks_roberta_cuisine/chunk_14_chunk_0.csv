After walking through El Rastro flea market, we walked to Toga which was only 5 minutes away. It's a very small and simple restaurant with very few tables. I found the lunch menu to be very limited and the food was rather bland, and I also thought that the price was slightly on the high side. For a limited lunch menu everything served must be up to par and what it was not. The food was not memorable at all and we were quite disappointed after leaving the restaurant.

But Everyone in the restaurant is nice, Food is very reasonable and most people ended up getting a great time there. Also, it is a sharp contrast from generally rich Madrid food and people will no doubt look for a change. They also speak better English most Spanish places.

I will sing praises and have written many reviews! We ate here twice during a 3 day visit. The first time we were able to have the menu del dia - what a deal! For 21 Euros we had white wine, caprese salad, a creamy vegetable soup, a paella like rice dish, pork and potatoes. We don't eat wheat so we passed on the bread and had tea and coffee instead of dessert. The food was outstanding and the service was too.  We went back the next day, a holiday, when there was no menu del dia, and had media raciones of ropa vieja and potatoes, 2 kinds of risotto, roasted vegetables, and wine for 27.70 Euros.

It was with incredible energy and a sympathy to make many people envious that my girlfriend and I were received in this small space. Although it was full, we spoke to the waiter and he quickly gave us feedback on how long we would have to wait to have a table (luckily we didin’t have to wait long). As always, we try every time we go to this type of restaurant, ask for a bit of various things in order to have chance to try more than one dish on the menu. I say for sure that I can’t choose a favourite dish, everything was great, very well prepared and the quantities were more than sufficient.

We went in on Sunday night first. When we arrived the restaurant wasn't busy but we were given seats were the staff was constantly opening the doors behind my back so we asked to be moved. There was no problem with that. The problem was the service which has absolutely no knowledge about the menu. We asked about the bottle of Champagne and our waitress wasn't able to describe if it was actually dry or any other specification. She said she will ask and walk out. Came back with answer which wasn't to our liking so I asked about the Rose and she needed to go and ask again. Then I asked about the white wine by the glass ( 1 choice! ) and when she said the third time she didn't know I just decided to go ahead with it, well I didn't have a different choice, did I ? We had a full 3 course meal and nobody bothered to ask if we were enjoying our food. By the end of our dinner the restaurant got busy and we needed to ask for dessert menus, then to order and also the bill.  Next day we decided to give them another try because of great location. Waiter was serving, cleaning table and basically doing all the service through railing and didn't even bother to go around. I felt there is a lack of management and training. The only reason why I am giving 3 stars was the food. I would normally never write a bad review but after receiving 3 emails I felt you might want to know.",2019-04-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7062431-Reviews-or160-Oven_Mozzarella_Bar_Fuencarral-Madrid.html,UID_13052,0.05,0.847,0.103,0.948,0.0710144927536231,0.4492753623188405,0.40310625,1434,144,0.100418410041841,1,29,False,72,0.0961538461538461,0.1346153846153846,0.3269230769230769,0.0384615384615384,0.1346153846153846,0.0192307692307692,0.0192307692307692,0.0576923076923076,0.1153846153846153,0.0576923076923076,279,172,4.139784946236559,0,0,spent two day madrid celebr birthday went sunday night first arriv restaur busi given seat staff constantli open door behind back ask move problem problem servic absolut knowledg menu ask bottl champagn waitress abl describ actual dri specif said ask walk came back answer like ask rose need go ask ask white wine glass choic said third time know decid go ahead well differ choic full cours meal nobodi bother ask enjoy food end dinner restaur got busi need ask dessert menu order also bill next day decid give anoth tri great locat waiter serv clean tabl basic servic rail even bother go around felt lack manag train reason give star food would normal never write bad review receiv email felt might want know,bad review,2,Spanish

I think uneven is the best way to describe the experience. Some of the food was really good, and some were more mediocre. The atmosphere is quite energetic - so if you are looking for a romantic dinner you do best to avoid this place. But if you're up to a noisy and crowded place this is more up your alley.  Staff was super nice and did their best to make sure we all had a good time.

I phoned the restaurant and informed the gentleman who answered my call what time I might arrive there by taxi to pick up my order of Insalata Cesare con Pollo and Tagliolini alle Vongole, he confirmed to have it prepared on time. When I arrived at the restaurant to find out that was the owner who took my order, he offered me a glass of prosecco and asked me to wait for 2 minutes, he just wanted to have the tagliolini cooked on the right moment and prepare it as good as it should be. Indeed, it was really as good as the owner assured! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the seafood was fresh. The only negative point and it was my personal problem which I did not request to the restaurant when I placed the order, I consume less salt than the normal people, so, the dish was a little bit salty for me, if you have the same concern, remember to remind the chef about it. I had a chance to observe the environment while I was waiting for my food, it is a very cozy place, good lighting, warm and friendly waiters, very smiley owner (also a chef), tasty food, I only can say, it is a very recommended place to relax and having well-prepared food.  There is also a wall stand where you can find many kinds of dry pasta, spices for sale.

We both ordered the fillet steak and, on Orlando’s advice, went with a single portion of fries and a salad.  The food was absolutely fabulous, indeed my wife said it was the best she had ever had. It was perfectly cooked and tasted great - no need to spoil it with any dressings! We had a very pleasant bottle of wine with the meal and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Everything was going smoothly until one of the service staff dropped a plate on the floor which sent bits of glass shards flying across the ground and unfortunately resulted in my toe and calf getting cut. What happened after that was a terrible display of service attitude: (1) service staff did not even bother to check if any of their customers were hurt (since we were seated pretty near the area where the plate broke) (2) nonchalant attitude by the service staff - did not offer any form of first aid despite seeing the bleeding cuts (3) person who dropped the plate DID NOT even come forward to offer any form of apology. (4) NO form of follow-ups on my injury either,2016-07-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7062431-Reviews-or670-Oven_Mozzarella_Bar_Fuencarral-Madrid.html,UID_13258,0.149,0.807,0.044,-0.936,-0.1785714285714285,0.7476190476190476,0.2512666666666667,716,54,0.0754189944134078,0,17,False,27,0.027027027027027,0.054054054054054,0.2432432432432432,0.0,0.081081081081081,0.081081081081081,0.054054054054054,0.1621621621621621,0.1621621621621621,0.1351351351351351,129,92,4.558139534883721,0,0,drop around pm dinner everyth go smoothli one servic staff drop plate floor sent bit glass shard fli across ground unfortun result toe calf get cut happen terribl display servic attitud servic staff even bother check custom hurt sinc seat pretti near area plate broke nonchal attitud servic staff offer form first aid despit see bleed cut person drop plate even come forward offer form apolog form follow up injuri either,bad review,2,Mexican

When we got there the place was packed (evidence of the high marks, I guessed). It was not a long wait as the place is full with mainly tourist who generally have dinner faster than our counterparts in Spain. We had the shrimps in garlic sauce and the tiger prawns as “tapas” and then it was when our disappointment started. Three of the dishes in the suggested list were not available (octopus, “veal secret”, paella) and in the main menu the raviolis. We chatted with another couple in the restaurant and they had the same issue. It may have been bad luck or that the place had been opened for only a month and were still struggling through the initial phase.

I didn't give five stars because i don't feel the meal was perfect but extremely close. Cool vibe, buzzing and a nice mix of locals and tourists. We ordered their ropa vieja 1/2 order tapa, verduras a la plancha (grilled veggies) with goat cheese and a special Paella, (we ordered reluctantly as I tend not to eat paella outside Valencia.) All three were extremely flavorful. Great portion sizes and the paella surprisingly didn't disappoint. I would have loved some caramelization on the rice but I know it was a special and I'm nitpicking admittedly. The star of the show however was by far the veggies. Perfectly seasoned and the cheese set the dish off right. We ordered vase of sangria and it was pretty damn good.

(10PM+ is just too late for me...) As soon as we walked in we were greeted by Andres. He was very funny and friendly. We were seated at a table in the front window of the restaurant... my husband is 6’4”... and he was a little too large for this area, so they let us move to a high top table. Some of the menus here in Madrid have been hard to order from, but this menu was easy to read and know what you were getting. In true American fashion... we ordered too much food but we really wanted to try a few things on the menu. We ordered the Moussaka, empanadas, seafood paella and a beef special. Everything that came out of the kitchen was hot and very tastey. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Madrid.",2019-09-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d14109792-Reviews-or110-El_Sur_de_Huertas-Madrid.html,UID_13373,0.006,0.866,0.127,0.9673,0.1781892230576441,0.4937719298245615,0.37185,876,93,0.1061643835616438,0,32,False,39,0.1538461538461538,0.1923076923076923,0.2692307692307692,0.0,0.2307692307692307,0.0384615384615384,0.0,0.0,0.0769230769230769,0.0384615384615384,173,120,4.069364161849711,0,0,went last night madrid made reserv day via email happi min wait otherwis pm late soon walk greet andr funni friendli seat tabl front window restaur husband littl larg area let us move high top tabl menu madrid hard order menu easi read know get true american fashion order much food realli want tri thing menu order moussaka empanada seafood paella beef special everyth came kitchen hot tastey would recommend place anyon visit madrid,good review,4,American

The food was absolute homely, delicious and perfectly accompanied by the Local Sangria. Served with utmost passion and care that spoke very high of the customer service standards. Gagan and Joshi were very attentive, prompt and always had the best in menu to suggest. Angel was great fun with his choice of menu from the Bar ! Went out satisfied, surprised and content only to return for dinner with my wife and we had a gala time with these beautiful bunch of people. Great food, great company, and the pataran (hope I got the spelling right) was the cherry on the top. Try it if you have not yet in Spain. Amazing experience that I feel now very happy about sharing. Thanks to Gagan, Joshi and Angel. Keep up the good work guys...  Finding a place with great food is awesome.

The wait staff is friendly, attentive, and efficient (a rarity in Spain), and even gave us a shot of limoncello free of charge. Whatever staton or mix they had playing was full of upbeat classics, which everyone seemed to enjoy. The food was fantastic; the patatas bravas were tasty, just the right amount of spice. The chicken rolls were great as well, and the Cuban flank steak was unique and mouth-watering. One of the biggest standouts among this homerun of a meal was the sangria. The sangria was light and refreshing, by far the best sangria we have ever tasted.  The kicker is that all of the food and drinks were very reasonably priced. We cannot recommend this highly enough.

Our waitress, Maura, is the best! She answered questions about their vegetarian options, in excellent English too, with a friendly smile and fun attitude! Okay now the food - in a word, freaking awesome! We had the eggplant starter and every bite had the perfect mixture of cheese and heaven.

We didn't make a reservation and the restaurant was moderately full (about half?) when we arrived at 5pm.  The service is attentive, smiley, tactile and so, so friendly. The guys working there obviously enjoy what they are doing and this is reflected in their passion and enthusiasm for their food and their reputation. The food is everything that has been stated before; I had hummus and Mr B had ham croquettes to start. I then had wok noodles with veg and Mr B had ""Beef Secret"" with some potato wedges and their ""secret"" sauce.  What I liked about this restaurant is that they wanted you to have a nice time above their desire to make money. For example, they suggested that the choices we were making may have been a challenge to finish and recommended half portions! Other restaurants I've been to would have let you purchase the lot and bin the waste!! This beautiful experience was rounded off with a jug of sangria (get a glass instead of a jug as you lose the decorative effect with a jug - the glasses that we saw being brought out were beverage works of art!!!) All this for just under 50 euro - wonderful. I had to keep dragging myself past for the remainder of our 5 night break and no where else we ate lived up to this brilliant experience.

The meal surpassed our expectations for 10 Euros, we liked all dishes, but they did not ask how we would like our beef cooked, maybe because they are making a bunch at once, so those who liked it more cooked would have to ask them to cook it a little more. Everything was delicious and it was worth waiting 15 minutes to sit inside as the air conditioning was good. We sat at the bar and seeing one of the staff pouring Estrella draft beer into some glasses made me want to try it, it was pretty god also.

First we had decide for another restaurant, found here on tripadvisor, but it was full, and the waiter told us that we should try this one, and followed us to Restaurant. The Restaurant was normally not our kind of restaurant, not due to the food but more to the more modern still of the restaurant. The food though was just great, maybe the best Spanish tapas I have ever tasted and I have been in many tapas places all over spain.  The food was very delicious an I would recommend everyone to visit this restruarant and do not be intimidated by the modern still, after 5 minutes of adopting to the stile, it was actually a very cool place. We ended up the a jar of sangaria 1L, and 5 different tapas menues recommended by the waiter, and paid 40 EUR which was very cheap when you considered the quality of the food.",2016-07-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10358028-Reviews-or1270-Inclan_Brutal_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_4648,0.0,0.845,0.155,0.9847,0.3951388888888889,0.5359259259259259,0.31486,877,88,0.1003420752565564,0,16,False,47,0.0,0.2692307692307692,0.4230769230769231,0.0,0.2692307692307692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0384615384615384,0.0,164,107,4.347560975609756,0,0,first even madrid end restuar first decid anoth restaur found tripadvisor full waiter told us tri one follow us restaur restaur normal kind restaur due food modern still restaur food though great mayb best spanish tapa ever tast mani tapa place spain food delici would recommend everyon visit restruar intimid modern still minut adopt stile actual cool place end jar sangaria l differ tapa menu recommend waiter paid eur cheap consid qualiti food,good review,4,Spanish

Located on a small side street, Inclan is named after the writer and dramatist, Ramon del Valle-Inclan. The decor is eclectic but the ceiling motif of huge feather pens and nibs is a homage to Inclan. The menu was a bit hard to decipher at first but we plunged in not completely sure what was coming in the way of food but, wow, what great surprise when the Caesar salad arrived completely deconstructed. The fabulous waiter then trimmed the greens from a potted salad, mixed in the ingredients and voila a wonderful Caesar. We then had artichoke risotto, wonderful , and scallops. THe presentation of scallops is on a large plate with he scallops on the half shell. They are seared at the table. Excellent. A note: may be slightly underdone for some diners.

As it was our first time vacationing in Madrid, we chose to use Trip Advisor. This restaurant received a great rating and was within a very walkable distance to us following an excellent 3 hour Context Tour of Madrid. We did not have a reservation, but our party of 4 was seated pretty quickly at a long table in the rear of the restaurant. We chose to eat an “all-inclusive” meal (drink, several dishes, and a dessert) called Evolucion Tapas. EVERY unusual dish was amazingly delicious and beautifully presented!!!

From the minute we walked in the staff (all of them!) set the stage for an incredible night. They clearly love their restaurant and the people who come to enjoy their food. They are warm, generous, fun and funny. The environment is a complete joy to be in and the tables were filled from front to back with couples and families. We sat at a table by the bar and were surrounded by incredible people from all sides, that took great care of us.

My son checked out the reviews on TA and it looked good. Place is unassuming, but the food is absolutely amazing! Tapas -- Grilled veggies, seafood paella, curry chicken with walnuts and raisins and cod with goat cheese and Honey ... God I miss this place. They offer full and half plates and that's great for sharing. The Sangria alone is worth stopping in for. Giselle and Ruben were very friendly and attentive.

We were sat upstairs, the decor looked good. The problems started with getting a menu, we waited ages and had to ask a few times, then only got one between the two of us. The waiter said he would get another, but didn't. When we ordered my wife ordered her starter and main, I don't think he expected her to do that as he found it difficult to understand that I would order after her, he kept asking if we wanted to share. Eventually we managed to convince him we wanted a meal each. Next someone else came to us with a glass of white wine, we had ordered a bottle of red. They went round every table to ask who had ordered the wine until they found the person who had. This happened every time food was brought out. They would go from table to table until they found the right one. When the waiter came with our bottle of wine he had trouble opening it, he wandered off after seeming to hear something in the earpiece they wore, he went off and started talking to his colleagues and we had to attract his attention to get him to come back. We found we always had to ask at least twice and usually more than one member of staff before they would see what we wanted. They were easily distracted and would leave in the middle of serving you to do something else and forget to come back to you. Other reviews have praised the service, so I guess we were unlucky that night. (17 October 2016) The food was great, we started with baked aubergine in tomato and mozzarella and a platter with meats and cheeses. Both outstanding. For mains we had prawn filled ravioli and lobster filled larger ravioli ( can't remember the name of the pasta). Really nice. For sweet we had tiramisu which was good and a baked biscuit/cookie covered in a chocolate sauce with ice cream, which my wife thought was the best desert she has had. All this and a bottle of red wine was €75  It seems a lovely place and the food was terrific, but the service was comical and made it difficult to enjoy the evening.",2016-10-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7062431-Reviews-or600-Oven_Mozzarella_Bar_Fuencarral-Madrid.html,UID_13665,0.042,0.823,0.136,0.9937,0.162797619047619,0.5042328042328044,0.2801947368421052,2053,192,0.0935216755966877,0,41,False,93,0.1414141414141414,0.1818181818181818,0.2121212121212121,0.0808080808080808,0.1717171717171717,0.0303030303030303,0.0303030303030303,0.0404040404040404,0.0606060606060606,0.0505050505050505,391,217,4.250639386189258,0,0,walk past earlier day thought would give go sat upstair decor look good problem start get menu wait age ask time got one two us waiter said would get anoth order wife order starter main think expect found difficult understand would order kept ask want share eventu manag convinc want meal next someon els came us glass white wine order bottl red went round everi tabl ask order wine found person happen everi time food brought would go tabl tabl found right one waiter came bottl wine troubl open wander seem hear someth earpiec wore went start talk colleagu attract attent get come back found alway ask least twice usual one member staff would see want easili distract would leav middl serv someth els forget come back review prais servic guess unlucki night octob food great start bake aubergin tomato mozzarella platter meat chees outstand main prawn fill ravioli lobster fill larger ravioli rememb name pasta realli nice sweet tiramisu good bake biscuit cooki cover chocol sauc ice cream wife thought best desert bottl red wine seem love place food terrif servic comic made difficult enjoy even,average review,3,Italian
