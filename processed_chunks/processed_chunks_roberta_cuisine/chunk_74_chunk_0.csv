They were wrong big time on both counts. Reviewing the menu, myself and my partner found it challenging to find a dish that wouldn't require our intestinal tracks to work overtime during the night, thus depriving us of a full night's sleep. Heavy, sleep deprivation dishes. So we opted for what we considered would be a pleasant pre-sleep light dish - salmon with a mushroom risotto. Ooops...... The presentation was acceptable, but as they say, never judge a book by its cover.... The first ‘fork-au-fish into our mouths sent alarm bells ringing. It didn't taste of fish. ' Weird ' I thought to myself, 'it sure looks pink and looks like salmon'. We challenged ourselves again to taste the oddly tasting pink coloured square .... we nearly barfed. The 'thing' tasted old, bordering on putrefaction. We dove into the mushroom risotto. Bad move. It tasted even worse - if that was even possible.... We reached for water to save ourselves from a potential catastrophe at the table. Knife and fork where repositioned back on the plates in a fashion like a castaway on an island places objects on the sand to spell 'SOS'. This was our ‘SOS’…… The waitress came. She was a sweet lady from the Philippines. She looked concerned as she removed the plates. 'Sir it was not good?' she asked as she looked downwards. This was clearly a rhetorical question as the plate had barely been touched. We shook our heads. She continued to look down, winced a smile, and removed the sad offering. We asked for the menu and chose a salad. Well you can’t screw up lettuce..... can you? 10 minutes later our Philippines waitress reappeared and asked if we would be paying for the piscine debacle as if we didn’t, her boss (read ‘ slave owner’) would deduct the cost from her salary. Tears welled in her eyes as she looked for comfort from us. ’Of course we will pay’ we retorted. With tears in her eyes, she smiled, thanked us profusely and looked down sheepishly. She was clearly scared and had clearly been threatened by someone. Fast forward to today and I read with extreme disappointment and anger that the manager of said restaurant had fired the sweet waitress on account of our returning the inedible food. This is totally unacceptable and I would urge the general public to avoid this restaurant until said employee is reinstated. This is a total abuse of authority and is unacceptable in the year 2017.

We were provided with two gratis amuse bouche - fresh olives and a potato salad with lemon and peas. Very tasty and enough to awaken the palate with a taste of the local cava. The appetizers were the salted cod (bacala), tempura fried. It was excellent and very tasty. This fish has a subtle favor, as it has been first preserved by drying it with salt, It is reconstituted by soaking it in water. Then it's cooked. The end result is a delicate flavor that pairs well with most light whites the Spanish are famous for. The other appetizer was seared foie gras with an onion chutney and Pedro Ximinez reduction. Those who love paring foie and sauterne will find this dish delightful and exciting, as did we. Paired it with a glass of house Sangria. We split an order of suckling pig, which as melt in your mouth good. The skin was crispy and chewy without being the least bit rubbery. More Sangria. We skipped dessert, but were offered a spice and fruit infused grappa that was a perfect digestive for such a rich meal. Not diet food, but we don't count calories when on holiday.

It was a gloriously sunny day so all outdoor tables were taken and had a mighty wait but we were offered a table in the basement. We were warned there were low tables but we were quite expecting the beach bar we found ourselves in!!  The tables and chairs were a few inches off the floor and the floor was covered in sand! The 15 year old in our party was in her element; cool and trendy!! There was an extensive menu with plenty of non meat options for us fussy eaters and the cocktail and drinks menu was fantastic. The food and drinks were great and the service as expected in Spain... we weren't in a hurry; the table of Spanish girls on a hen party kept us entertained!! Would certainly go for a return visit but would try to secure a table ground level and leave the basement for the youngsters!!,2017-04-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d794378-Reviews-or100-Ojala-Madrid.html,UID_12093,0.034,0.782,0.184,0.9852,0.2349489795918367,0.5074829931972789,0.47915,872,81,0.0928899082568807,9,18,False,33,0.1428571428571428,0.1666666666666666,0.2619047619047619,0.0714285714285714,0.119047619047619,0.0238095238095238,0.0238095238095238,0.0476190476190476,0.0952380952380952,0.0476190476190476,165,105,4.284848484848485,0,0,wander around madrid fell upon littl gem restaur glorious sunni day outdoor tabl taken mighti wait offer tabl basement warn low tabl quit expect beach bar found tabl chair inch floor floor cover sand year old parti element cool trendi extens menu plenti non meat option us fussi eater cocktail drink menu fantast food drink great servic expect spain hurri tabl spanish girl hen parti kept us entertain would certainli go return visit would tri secur tabl ground level leav basement youngster,good review,4,Spanish

The welcome was very friendly and they gave us a lovely table by the window. The bar was on two levels. As walk in, there is a bar and to the left is where you can sit for food. The ambience was for a traditional tapas bar with low lighting with red and orange tones. There were many tables occupied with laughing groups of friends - from all around the world!  The wine bottles started from €16.50 a bottle. We shared a lovely Rioja wine and they have us a tapas dish to share. The first tapas dish they have us was small cubes potatoes with sausage, tomato and peppers - delicious! They also have us another tapas dish which consisted of baked bread with a creamy smoked salmon and red onion topping. I'm going to attempt to make this at home!

I found Felix, he remembered us, brought out a new kilo of raw meat, a new hot rock and the kids were over the moon. He didn't charge us the second round and in good faith, brought us after dinner drinks to the alley. He was by far, the most attentive and responsive waiter we've had in Madrid!

We arrived at the restaurant at 8:30pm on a Thursday night and it was nearly full. The male waiter at the counter was annoyed that we did not book for a table. Bluntly said to us that there were only seats along the windows available. We said we didn't mind. Quite a long while after we sat down, there were still no waiters come and explain to us how we should order as we have no idea how big the dishes is and how much we should order. All the waiters keep walking past us, looking stressed but none of them look at us or offer their service. This was quite annoying. Finally a female waiter come to take our order. I asked her in English to recommend a dry white. She suddenly gave out a grunt then squished her head and left. We wondered what happened and later another female waiter come and helped with our wine order. We just understood that the first female waiter didn't speak English. After ordering a bottle of wine, we thought the same English speaking waiter would come back to take our food order but she just disappeared to another section. After quite a while, we nearly finished our first glass if wine. The first female waiter who doesn't speak English come back to take our food order. This time she brought along a Spanish language menu, so when we point at the items on our English menu, she referred to her Spanish menu.  She also explained to us that for two of us, we need to order at least five items to share. Most of dishes come in two small pieces except those stated on the menu one piece. The five dishes come randomly from about 10 minutes to an hour.  Strips of beef with special barbecue sauce 5.10€ - From Yakibonakas Spiced rice, grilled over charcoal in a banana leaf 3.90€ - On the side Variegated scallop, lime and ají amarillo chili ceviche 5.90€ - From the water Crispy fried chicken with a sweet and sour cañí sauce 5.20€ - From the farmyard Wagyu ribs meat, grilled in teriyaki sauce 7.20€ - From the ranch All the items are really tasty but the serving was really small for the price they charged. Only the chicken and the rice dishes are quite enough for two persons to share. The other three dishes were just a little too mean and we would need to order one serving for each person and we are not big eaters, two servings if you are a big eater. We love the deco and think the design is great. We love how the seats slightly swirl out from the kitchen in the middle of the large room and those big windows.  We found the dining experience was good because the vibes were great. If the experience had not been let down by rude waiters and some of the dishes could be certainly be more generous for the price.",2016-09-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10186319-Reviews-or50-Yakitoro_by_Chicote-Madrid.html,UID_54596,0.032,0.871,0.097,0.9924,0.041333103289625,0.3550523349436394,0.2804230769230769,2763,247,0.089395584509591,0,53,False,134,0.1176470588235294,0.1911764705882352,0.3382352941176471,0.0588235294117647,0.1617647058823529,0.0294117647058823,0.0147058823529411,0.0294117647058823,0.0588235294117647,0.0,523,274,4.279158699808796,0,0,love idea fusion japanes spanish better lighter meal hot night arriv restaur pm thursday night nearli full male waiter counter annoy book tabl bluntli said us seat along window avail said mind quit long sat still waiter come explain us order idea big dish much order waiter keep walk past us look stress none look us offer servic quit annoy final femal waiter come take order ask english recommend dri white suddenli gave grunt squish head left wonder happen later anoth femal waiter come help wine order understood first femal waiter speak english order bottl wine thought english speak waiter would come back take food order disappear anoth section quit nearli finish first glass wine first femal waiter speak english come back take food order time brought along spanish languag menu point item english menu refer spanish menu also explain us two us need order least five item share dish come two small piec except state menu one piec five dish come randomli minut hour strip beef special barbecu sauc yakibonaka spice rice grill charcoal banana leaf side varieg scallop lime aj amarillo chili cevich water crispi fri chicken sweet sour ca sauc farmyard wagyu rib meat grill teriyaki sauc ranch item realli tasti serv realli small price charg chicken rice dish quit enough two person share three dish littl mean would need order one serv person big eater two serv big eater love deco think design great love seat slightli swirl kitchen middl larg room big window found dine experi good vibe great experi let rude waiter dish could certainli gener price,good review,4,Spanish

Nice atmosphere. Now the bad. The food. The menu is a mess. Whatever Japanese Spanish Tapas Fusion idea the chef had does not work. Tried several of the yaki skewer type dishes and they were either bland, buried in sauce, not aesthetically pleasing or all of the above. Looking for something more substantial I noticed the YakiRamen dishes. I asked the waitress if they were in fact noodle dishes as the name would imply and she said yes. Again a disaster. Not really ramen. A heavy bowl of sauce with a few pieces of calamari and muscles. And at 12 euros for that and approximately 6-8 euros for the small tapa skewers it was a lot to pay for very overrated food. Can't understand the ratings so high when I can think of many better options in Madrid. If you want Japanese go elsewhere. If you want tapas, there are traditional and non-traditional options throughout Madrid at reasonable prices. You can even find Asian fusion elsewhere more appetizing. This entire experience was painful and pretentious. And no point of drowning the experience in sorrow with beer and wine prices also ridiculously high for Madrid.

Luckily it was at end of spanish lunch time so it was quite empty and food arrived fast. Tables are really close together - no privacy but clever idea of a storing stool per table for your bags and stuff... alcoholic drinks are on the rocks in the middle of the table, soft drinks and water have to be ordered. Music is very cool indy rock, restaurant nicely decorated with insulation material witch creats good acoustics! Food is a true fusion of spanish tapas with (mainly) japanese preparation techniques (yakitori barbacue) and different asian sauces. All we chose were very good - also good value size to price. Especially good: wagiu beef, meat balls, cheese cake and wasabi ice cream. Serving of food was friendly but a bit unorganised (side dishes were served first, then different tapas dropped, but not according to guests orders... as we shared most that was not tragic, but if it is more full and you have to wait for your dish it might be annoying).

We'd decided on a steak from the grill house over the road and when we got there despite a large sign saying ""abierto"" and the doors being open and the waiters being on the floor, they decided they weren't open for an hour! Why do restaurants do this? Anyway, we hit trip advisor and across the road is this highly rated Japanese tapas bar. We weren't really in the mood for tapas but it was this or maybe something rubbish after a long walk, so we got there in 3 mins. The (manager) looked up from his laptop as we entered and said hello and advised we could only have the table for 2 hours (who spends longer in a tapas bar?) but he seemed friendly enough, the place was large with lots of free tables at 6pm. We asked the cute waitress if she spoke English and with a stern look as if I'd asked for her phone number she said ""no"" but she was beautiful so it only made us like her more. We were given English menus and they revealed some really interesting menu items, all tapas priced, about 4 to 6 euro each. We went for safe options, deep fried cod bites, lamb with tzatki, chicken meatballs and a beefburger in some kind of soy sauce. Although the meatballs were a little cold (may have been the style) the food was fantastic. Not massive portions but enough to get the flavour of the dish. The other waitresses were smilier but not as attractive as the first. When she brought our beefburger we got her to say beefburger and this actually raised a smile from her which pushed the review from 4 to 5 stars. So back to the food. We decided on another dish of pork in a spicy sauce which was great then we opted for dessert, apple pie and ice cream for me and white chocolate for my friend, both of them would bring a tear to a glass eye and put your grandmother out of business. The bill including drinks was 39 euro, so about 16 quid each for one of my favourite meals. We need places like this in the UK, simply awesome.

Just make sure you book your reservation many days in advance. If you are looking for an excellent alternative for suckling pig, then try Los Galayos right off the Plaza de Mayor. They offer high quality Castilian cuisine and have been doing it since 1894. We started with a salad topped with burratta cheese, which was excellent and we both went for the suckling pig. The skin was crispy and delicious and the meat just fell off the bone. The scalloped potatoes complemented the pork very well. The only problem with the entire meal is that we chose to sit inside. There was apparently a tour group of about 30 there having dinner and they were a bit noisy especially after drinking some wine. There are two outside areas where you can also be seated…right in front of the restaurant or on the Plaza de Mayor itself. We didn’t know this seating was available as we made a reservation through the concierge at our hotel. I think we would have chosen outside on the plaza, especially on such a beautiful evening.",2017-09-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991050-Reviews-or170-Los_Galayos-Madrid.html,UID_54628,0.019,0.882,0.099,0.9509,0.3497478991596638,0.661153127917834,0.320325,1152,107,0.0928819444444444,0,19,False,46,0.0303030303030303,0.1515151515151515,0.2727272727272727,0.0303030303030303,0.0606060606060606,0.0303030303030303,0.0909090909090909,0.0606060606060606,0.2121212121212121,0.0606060606060606,209,146,4.516746411483253,0,0,want eat oldest restaur madrid world believ want suckl pig everyon tell go rest b make sure book reserv mani day advanc look excel altern suckl pig tri lo galayo right plaza de mayor offer high qualiti castilian cuisin sinc start salad top burratta chees excel went suckl pig skin crispi delici meat fell bone scallop potato complement pork well problem entir meal chose sit insid appar tour group dinner bit noisi especi drink wine two outsid area also seat right front restaur plaza de mayor know seat avail made reserv concierg hotel think would chosen outsid plaza especi beauti even,good review,4,Spanish

It was an amazing atmosphere with a short but interesting menu.  Prices are acceptable but if you want to have your dinner or lunch there, you need to order at least 5-6 tapas to share (2 people). In the end, if you order 6 tapas and 2-3 drinks, the bill is round 40-45 euro.  Each plate is like a tapa to share. They offer you a food you are familiar but with a speacial touch on them.

Cesar, in particular, greeted us with a smile and was helpful in choosing our meal. We had the paella mixta which is a mixture of meats, seafood and vegetables. Like any paella, you wait for about 25 minutes for it to cook. While waiting, they provided us with olives and a tuna spread with a big bread. We were only able to finish one bread among the 3 of us, unless we wanted to ruin our appetite. The paella was flavorful and cooked just right. The squid was tender as well as the other meats in it. We also had Cochinilla, roasted suckling pig. The meat was tender and juicy while the skin is crispy. The bacalao was a welcome addition to our meal. Again, these people know how to cook as the fish was tender and juicy without the fishy smell or taste. We were too full for dessert. We even had our leftovers to go. They have us lychee schnapps at the end of our meal which was actually good, not the usual cough syrup taste I've had in the past. It was a good experience, all in all.

It has been in existence since 1894 and a favourite of Madrids great debaters and intellectuals since the '30's. Take time to have a wander around it, particularly downstairs where you can see old historic photos of the people who have visited over the years and the well stocked wine cellar. Also downstairs are the spotlessly clean and attractive toilets. The staff are friendly and were very helpful when it came to menu choices for my coeliac partner who rated their warm gluten free bread the best she had ever had. The wine list was excellent and not overpriced, all the wines listed showed their regions of origin and producers. On our first visit we chose the shrimps in garlic oil for starters and veal for our main course.Mine came in the form of a veal steak sliced into thin slices which you cooked yourself on a hot stone on the table whilst S's was a grilled cutlet. We never did find out why hers was different to mine but it had something to do with being gluten free. We suspect that it was probably because mine was dusted with flour before being flash browned on the outside before being brought to the table. The only slight niggle was the usual problem of the vegetables not being piping hot which seems the norm in Spain. A flask of peach and cinnamon liqueur compliments of the house was brought to the table after we had finished eating and this happened again when we went there for lunch on our last day. On that occasion we both had the Paella Mixta which contained squid, chicken, rabbit and prawns and which we rated the best ever. An altogether great restaurant, easily found near the Plaza Mayor and well worth a visit.",2014-03-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991050-Reviews-or400-Los_Galayos-Madrid.html,UID_54670,0.018,0.842,0.14,0.9898,0.2771505376344086,0.5258064516129033,0.4723666666666667,1785,161,0.0901960784313725,0,24,False,65,0.0454545454545454,0.1136363636363636,0.2954545454545454,0.0,0.1818181818181818,0.0909090909090909,0.0227272727272727,0.0681818181818181,0.0909090909090909,0.0909090909090909,323,208,4.529411764705882,0,0,restaur recommend us concierg palacio de tepa hotel see review prove first rate choic exist sinc favourit madrid great debat intellectu sinc take time wander around particularli downstair see old histor photo peopl visit year well stock wine cellar also downstair spotlessli clean attract toilet staff friendli help came menu choic coeliac partner rate warm gluten free bread best ever wine list excel overpr wine list show region origin produc first visit chose shrimp garlic oil starter veal main cours mine came form veal steak slice thin slice cook hot stone tabl whilst grill cutlet never find differ mine someth gluten free suspect probabl mine dust flour flash brown outsid brought tabl slight niggl usual problem veget pipe hot seem norm spain flask peach cinnamon liqueur compliment hous brought tabl finish eat happen went lunch last day occas paella mixta contain squid chicken rabbit prawn rate best ever altogeth great restaur easili found near plaza mayor well worth visit,very good review,5,Spanish

The food is good, I ate paella marisco/seafood. Of course I have to admit there is no place outside Valencia where I could taste a real paella! However it was still very good! The restaurant was kind enough to allow me to order an individual paella, although there is not such thing in the menu! Everything is for minimum 2 people in the menu! But ask if you want! Also it was big enough to share between two people if you also order other tapas and assume this is one of the tapas too!  All in all it was a pleasant atmosphere, good Spanish food for tourists!

Ordered a couple of beers, and the beers and tapas just kept coming, like they didn't want us to leave! We were stuffed full of food -- mostly fried potatoes, croquetas, tortilla, etc. I couldn't understand how they were able to make any money with all of the food sent our way. Definitely found better quality tapas in other places, but this place was all about quantity and getting to know the gregarious staff -- Martin and the others were incredible: fun, sweet, chatty, informative. On our second visit we were treated to jamon y queso and also some paella in addition to the normal fare. The place is jostling and busy, seems to cater to a young but divers crowd, and is a cheap way to fill up before going out or to cap off a night of drinking. Our first visit we probably had 10 or 12 beers, plate after plate after plate of tapas, some digestivos, and also shots of something particularly potent and homemade (after closing, of course!).

Having lived in Spain twice, there are certain things I can't do without when I'm here, one of which is a truly authentic tapas bar. Not the busy commercial ones you find on the big streets who overcharge, but the small bar with amazing food you find on the smaller streets. I can happily say that while I hadn't been here before, I have found my new favorite spot at Bar Respiro. I will be here every time I come to Madrid moving forward!  The food was excellent, incredibly high value (several tapas are free) and the people are warm and friendly. It feels ""casero"" meaning as if it's homemade. If you're looking for something fancy, don't come here, but if you want delicious food, warm people and a truly authentic tapas experience, you're in for a treat at Bar Respiro.  A few tips:  -find Violeta, the owner  -you'll need to be prepared for very little English  -a few of the tapas are completely free! This is what the real authentic places do. I suggest the patatas bravas, the chicken and the chorizo.  -the tortilla is very good and typical of what you find in the authentic tapas bars  Enjoy!

The staff are warm and welcoming and the tapas is impressive. With each drink we ordered we got free food. Patatas Bravas made with a creamy sauce and spicy sauce were my favorite. I went there on a Friday night and the place was packed. It was my birthday and when the staff heard this, they gave me free shots of tequila and candy.

Ordered the pate based on TA , it was just ok. Large enough to share, but not the greatest. Fairly weak in seasoning. Had the mixed paella for 2( 40 E) and it was so disappointing. 4 prawns, little tiny pcs of fish or chicken, couldn't tell which, & calamari. No sausage, no chicken thighs, a few vegs. A lot of rice. It was huge, so enough for 2 plus. But no crispy crust on the bottom that makes a paella. It was too mushy. Just very average. Waitstaff just does their job. Nothing special. They do not make you feel welcomed. They have a job,if you know what I mean. Too many other places that love the tourists...Go to La Barraca or St. James and have a better meal, just costs a bit more.

The staff was very helpful with the planning and everything went off without any problems. The room was tight, but so picturesque that everyone loved it. The staff even arranged for a tuna band to play, and for a wedding cake to be delivered and even supplied the traditional sword to cut the cake (which delighted the groom, and made his brothers all envious!). We have returned several times after the wedding for mid day dinners at Los Galayos with friends and family, usually large parties of 6 to 10 or more, and have always had wonderful experiences. The last time it was just the two of us (last week), and the staff still remembered the wedding and treated us like VIPs. We will return here again and again.

My boyfriend and I were staying in the center of the city, and our host recommended this place to us. It was 10-12 minutes away from the Airbnb and one of a few restaurants with outdoor seating in a small plaza. It was a gorgeous day and we were lucky to get a table outside. We started with chips and guacamole, then I got the salad with chicken and a glass of white Sangria. The guacamole was done perfectly, thick and mildly chunky with great flavor. The salad was mixed greens with grilled chicken, a hard-boiled egg, croutons, avocado, and sun-dried tomatoes in a light creamy dressing. It was delicious and very filling even for a small-ish serving. The sangria really blew my tastebuds though. It was sparkling white wine with cointreau, mint leaves, grapes and a few bits of cubed pineapple. It was both beautiful and sooo tasty. This was followed by a slice of their ""zanahoria"" aka carrot cake, which was one of the best I've had. My boyfriend agreed and that's one of his all time favorite desserts.  The food/drink quality was amazing and the location great. I felt like I was sitting in the middle of NYMag's street style section with tons of super hip people.

On arriving to this place we found that the primary concern of the staff was to know the name of our hotel, presumably because of some kick-back arrangement. Our first waiter was extremely pushy, returning every two minutes to get our order, when we clearly weren't ready. He must have been exasperated, because after about six attempts in 10 minutes, a second waiter took over. The food itself was uninspired, with the predictable items that can be found anywhere (but better prepared). The assorted cheese platter consisted of 10 slices of mancheco, and a couple of a second cheese. The rest of the food was similarly drab and did not taste freshly prepared, with the main theme being salt.  In short, there is simply no reason to eat in this place.

Being it for the worse though. To my understanding human beings can have a bad day or the restaurant might be busy. But in my life time of 23 years, have i never been treated so rude and with such impoliteness by any restaurant staff at all. But this was a first for me, i heard a lot of good stories about Ojala, they are supossed to be this great place, with nice food and friendly staff... The Opposite was true for us. We entered the restaurant and i instantly got this claustrophobic feeling, it was so small and everyone was clusterd together and the at the atmosphere was very very humid! Since it was very busy, me and a friend were waiting in the queue for nearly 5 min for a table to come available. So there it was the FREE table, since we eventually were first in the queue we asked the lady if we could sit there. She refused to appoint the table to us, cause we were just with 2 and it was a 4 person table. We said alright no problem we will go somewhere else. The moment we left a couple behind us, (who didnt have a reservation since they asked if they could have a table aswell) was allowed to sit on that very same table. So we turned around and said to this unpolite waitress  "" why is it that we just asked if we could sit there, you refused. Now the exact same amount of people (2) asks to sit there and are instantly allowed to sit there'' She than said on the most rude and sarcastic way: '' Listen my love, a third person is coming'' The funny thing is the couple were seemingly dating, so we had our doubts that a third person was coming. Anyway... She said, good bye and litteraly pushed us outside... 45min later we walked by Ojala again because we ate somewhere else, the same couple was still sitting there with just the 2 of them... Conclusion, if you like polite, honest and good service, do not go to Ojala. I was very enthousiastic to go there at first, but i would never advice it to anyone. If you want some good spanish food, with a nice quality service, there are better places to go. As i said before, i am not the typ that complains or even writes reviews at all, but for this ''restaurant'' i will make a exception... This is a zero quality and rude place that can not even be called a restaurant since they treat customers/guests as numbers and not as a human beings.

Good wine, tasty food, big portions and very considerate service. Very reasonable pric.  It was in February and we took a table outside. There was mobile heating to make us warm and comfortable.  Afterwards we returned to La Palateria 3 more times. Also for lunch.  Everytime we were treated with welcome littile starter while waitng, and once even by a dessert.

The service was excellent and very quick ..first up I ordered sangria which came with the best olives I have had yet in Madrid. I decided to order Ox Tails ...and was not disappointed...it was simply delicious and cooked perfectly and served with rice.  The waiters all spoke English and they also had the board menu in English which is always an advantage for those of us who have not yet mastered Spanish.

It's a tiny restaurant but there were some seats available and we quickly grabbed them. We were given menus but also advised that there were some recommended items for the day - the tortilla con calabacin (a frittata with pumpkin), the croquetas de tomate y hierbabuena (tomato and mint croquettes), the albondingas de lentejas roja y coco (red lentil and coconut meatballs), and tacos!  I had seen the reviews and read the owner's blog and knew I wanted to try the tortilla and croquettes and her freshly made bread. My friend ordered a pincho (slice) of the tortilla which came with a small basket of bread and the croquettes (6 units). I ordered a bocadillo (sandwich) of the tortilla.  Everything arrived after an adequate amount of time without problem. The tortilla is amazing. Maybe one of the best tortillas I've ever had INCLUDING non-vegan tortillas, of which I've tried many of the best in the city. I loved it. However, it is quite sweet due to the pumpkin. The pincho (slice) is big enough to share between two people and costs 3.50 (bread included).  The croquettes were perfectly cooked and huge. Unfortunately I didn't like the filling. Tomato and mint is just a weird combination for me. However, I know that the croquette flavors change regularly so I am eager to return to try and different flavor combination.  The bocadillo was also massive. I was presented with a toasted baguette (homemade) topped with a pincho of tortilla. I loved every single bite.  Overall we spent 17.50 euros and just under an hour here. I will definitely return for the tortilla and to try more things. I 100% recommend this place to vegans and vegetarians. You can tell it's authentic food - I also recommend checking out the owner's blog (same name as the restaurant). Her story and philosophy on food is very interesting and genuine.",2018-03-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d11694448-Reviews-El_Perro_Gamberro-Madrid.html,UID_26422,0.023,0.782,0.194,0.9972,0.2460678210678211,0.5083194583194582,0.3667999999999999,1891,145,0.076679005817028,1,63,False,52,0.0816326530612244,0.1632653061224489,0.2653061224489796,0.0408163265306122,0.2448979591836734,0.0,0.0204081632653061,0.0408163265306122,0.1020408163265306,0.0408163265306122,326,200,4.788343558282208,0,0,friend arriv raini friday afternoon tini restaur seat avail quickli grab given menu also advis recommend item day tortilla con calabacin frittata pumpkin croqueta de tomat hierbabuena tomato mint croquett albondinga de lenteja roja coco red lentil coconut meatbal taco seen review read owner blog knew want tri tortilla croquett freshli made bread friend order pincho slice tortilla came small basket bread croquett unit order bocadillo sandwich tortilla everyth arriv adequ amount time without problem tortilla amaz mayb one best tortilla ever includ non vegan tortilla tri mani best citi love howev quit sweet due pumpkin pincho slice big enough share two peopl cost bread includ croquett perfectli cook huge unfortun like fill tomato mint weird combin howev know croquett flavor chang regularli eager return tri differ flavor combin bocadillo also massiv present toast baguett homemad top pincho tortilla love everi singl bite overal spent euro hour definit return tortilla tri thing recommend place vegan vegetarian tell authent food also recommend check owner blog name restaur stori philosophi food interest genuin,very good review,5,Mexican

You will be seated according to the perceived standing of yours in society. Tourists, like us, needed to stay in the front (high tables). There are other, more elegant tables as well.  Food: simply excellent. Pure enjoyment. I can highly recommend avocado-orange salad, very seldom have I tasted anything so close to perfection. My husband had stake and he shared my sentiments exactly. Wines were good too. Good desserts, excellent coffee.  They will charge you for the bread separately regardless whether you will have any. Moreover, they will add +10 VAT to the bill, which I have seldom seen in Madrid.  Service was quick and friendly. We were lucky with our waitress, she was grear. there are however others, who seem to have forgotten who is a customer and who indeed part of service personnel. But I guess there is a possibility to swim in a small bubble when all your customers represent the local high society, mas o menos.  Regardless of the amusement related to all of the above, it is worth the visit. The food is simply superb.

We tried to book for 9pm on a Friday night as we thought the place would be deserted if we arrived any earlier. The hotel came back to say they could only find us a table at 8pm. We imagined turning up to an empty restaurant so we were totally surprised to arrive at 8pm & find the front bar area buzzing & several tables already occupied in the back restaurant. Within 20 minutes most of the tables around us were occupied. If you think that locals don't eat until 10pm, you will be pleasantly surprised. We ordered 2 gin & tonics to start. Amazing! Best g&t I've ever had. I had thought the menus would only be in Spanish (& so I'd translated the menu into English before we got there so we'd know what to order) but we were presented with menus in English which was really helpful. Despite the restaurant becoming very busy (I think every table was reserved) service was good - timing was perfect - not rushed yet always attentive.  The covered patio area looked nice but we saw people smoking in there so we were pleased that we weren't sitting there.

We researched long and hard to find a good restaurant featuring “suckling pig” or “cochinillo”. The top 3 had no seating available so we opted for a 4 star “Asador Real”as they claimed to have the best roasted pig straight from Segovia.NOT!!! They promptly showed us a plump hind quarter of the pig with nice brown crispy skin and told us they would cut it up and bring it back to our table. With our watering mouths,hunger and excitement we waited. The waitress brings back the pig and to our surprise it was the head with ears and a plate full of sloppy fat and bones!!! Just awful!!We were furious and hailed the waitress and manager to explain their intentional and deceitful switch as he tried to explain it away and the waitress smirked!!We asked them to remove it and bring a piece that actually had pork meat on it, but we were now so angered by the audacity to outright deceit us we did not eat the new portion.

Instead of trying to remember my experience here a week from now, I'm going to relay it while still sitting here. Location-wise it couldn't be better. Nestled in a courtyard across the street from the Prado this place has been hopping for the two days that I have been staying here (the Radisson about 50 yards away).  While obviously I haven't sampled everything on the menu it is far more diverse than most similar restaurants in the city. Prawns, Sole, Baby Lamb, Cod, Hake, Duck Confit - much more diverse than the the usual octopus and other repetitive tapas you'll find in Madrid. I had two small plates: the foie gras and artisanal bread (which ended up being too much bread even for me who needed the bread to soak up the vino I've been drinking. To be clear, the ""foie"" is of the terrine variety so if you are not a fan you will likely poo-poo this review. I love both, and I found the terrine to be excellent. The beer and wine options are more than adequate but if you a wine snob then go to a wine-oriented establishment. They have a wine list by the bottle and they post their wines by the glass in the bar area. Along with the menu they post the ""Plateria"" on a couple of chalk boards which they will bring to your table if your eyesight isn't what it used to be. Spanish on one side, english on the other. What I love about this place especially is the energy. Many patrons inside and out and the locals apparently know many of the employees personally. Because of this, the staff moves at a fast pace. Do not be afraid to make yourself known but don't expect butler service. Best to know what you want to order in advance, be it food or beverage. That being said, they will try to help you if your spanish is ""muy mal"" (bad). ""Escusa me"" = ""Excuse me"" and ""Puedo tener"" = ""May I have"". Attempting these simple polite Spanish words will go far. It's now 11pm and my phone is about dead. Having eaten and drank at many establishments around the world, I am confident that you will enjoy this place so long as you are in happy + relax mode.",2019-03-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991104-Reviews-or30-La_Plateria-Madrid.html,UID_54897,0.043,0.854,0.104,0.9809,0.1670542635658915,0.4784606866002214,0.4341818181818181,2146,205,0.0955265610438024,0,74,False,70,0.0833333333333333,0.1666666666666666,0.2833333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.15,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.05,0.15,0.0166666666666666,407,252,4.2727272727272725,0,0,pm sunday march th sit bar sinc pm instead tri rememb experi week go relay still sit locat wise better nestl courtyard across street prado place hop two day stay radisson yard away obvious sampl everyth menu far divers similar restaur citi prawn sole babi lamb cod hake duck confit much divers usual octopu repetit tapa find madrid two small plate foie gra artisan bread end much bread even need bread soak vino drink clear foie terrin varieti fan like poo poo review love found terrin excel beer wine option adequ wine snob go wine orient establish wine list bottl post wine glass bar area along menu post plateria coupl chalk board bring tabl eyesight use spanish one side english love place especi energi mani patron insid local appar know mani employe person staff move fast pace afraid make known expect butler servic best know want order advanc food beverag said tri help spanish muy mal bad escusa excus puedo tener may attempt simpl polit spanish word go far pm phone dead eaten drank mani establish around world confid enjoy place long happi relax mode,very good review,5,Spanish

The hotel recommended EL BARRIL DE LAS CORTES as a good restaurant for Paella, and i must say it was excellent. So disappointed they were out of lobster, however the Paella we chose was excellent. The thing that surprised us the most was the friendliness of the servers. We neither spoke any Spanish, so it was up to the servers to help in many ways.

First off, we made a reservation for our party but ended up having to wait 30 min for our table to be cleaned and the bar area was too crowded to get a cocktail while we waited. The food was alright — the fried green tomatoes are delicious, the flammkuchen-esque pizza was great but served cold (it should have been warm), the Iberian skewer of pork was excellent but the sauces served on the side were interesting, the star of the night was the carrot cake though. I’d honestly come back just for the carrot cake. Overall, an average dining experience.

SERVICE: We (2 people) did not book a table so we had 1,5hours time to eat. Therefore, the waiter asked us if he could also bring our second dishes first if it’s ready faster than the starters. As we did not care too much about that, we agreed. Unfortunately, my second dish came, then both starters and in the end my friend's second dish (in the meanwhile the side dish was cold). Maybe we misunderstood the waiter but it's an unwritten gastronomic rule that you're serving the different courses of a meal at the same time. FOOD: The food itself was good but one starter was almost cold when it arrived so it tasted like a dish from the microwave (what a pity as I am sure it would have been much better!). I've had way better Chinese food before with a better price. For us it was slightly disappointing as we imagined more for the price (in another Chinese restaurant we went some weeks ago we had the same amount plus 2 deserts and a bottle of wine for the same final price). MOOD: When we arrived, there were about 5-6 more guests. After a short time, we heard a loud discussion (more a fight) in the kitchen between two staff members, followed by plates being thrown on the floor. As we guests heard all of it, it was kind of killing the relaxed mood for some minutes and something like that should never happen in any restaurant when there are guests!  So we both agreed that it’s a nice restaurant but we won’t visit it again as the price was too high for what we got...

This cheesecake s one of the best I have ever had - not quite as good as my grandmother's though.,2017-03-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4937390-Reviews-or40-Maricastana_Bar_Kitchen-Madrid.html,UID_9837,0.032,0.813,0.154,0.931,0.3866666666666667,0.6055555555555555,0.43772,455,46,0.1010989010989011,0,13,False,14,0.12,0.12,0.28,0.12,0.12,0.0,0.04,0.0,0.2,0.0,91,67,4.010989010989011,0,0,bar caf trendi part town came coffe cake cappuccino serv cinnamon nice twist though star cheesecak cheap euro proper continent bake cheesecak fabul balanc sweet sour citru guess made curd chees cheesecak one best ever quit good grandmoth though,good review,4,French

It was a flatbread and a bit on the dry side and pumpkin was not a topping - the crust itself was made of pumpkin which I couldn't really taste. Loaded with veggies but it was missing something.

Not a long speech of what might have gone wrong, or that the communication between the kitchen and the dinning room.

S...t happens,and this wouldn’t have been a problem , but what astonished me - server annoyingly cleaned the floor ( wouldn’t even hide that he was pissed ) wouldnt acknowledging us. He even left a broken glass on our table (!!!) .  He never offered us to order anotheR drink nor food ( as our food ended on the floor )  It was us who picked up the fallen food from the floor and put it on nearby table which he acknowledged 10 min later. This particularly sucks because it’s not our job to help him serve the food- and he should have not put us in this position. We are not trained servers!! He had at the time only 2 tables besides us.  This place is wanna be hip place with its set up and the ( old ) but trendy music- but one thing is clear- being an angry, rude and unprofessional j.rk is not hip nor cool last time I checked .

It is not cheap, but not as expensive as the decor and service might suggest. We paid $100 euros for a lunch for three, where two of us had wine (a very nice Rioja recommended by our server).  We arrived late, around 3 pm, and the place was filled with Spanish businessmen. People seemed to be finishing power lunches all around us, and many of them seemed to be regulars, well known by the staff.  The server started by bringing us a country pate and toast, for which we were later charged $3.50 each. That seems common in Madrid, but just recognize that the nice starter is not free and refuse it if you don't want it.  The service was pleasant and very attentive. The server gave us helpful suggestions in English. We had a wonderful appetizer of foie gras on toast, as well as a salad of borata and tomatoes that was pretty standard. Our main courses were the octopus, the hamburger, and the special fish of the day, a butter fish. All were very good. We were too full to have any dessert.

Firstly the welcome was underwhelming, which for a pricey half empty restaurant is bizarre. Secondly we were offered the English menus, but they were different with different dishes, one being more up to date than the other. How difficult is it these days with computers to just have current menus? Thirdly the white wine tasted ok but it had an off-putting musty smell. We asked for the glasses to be changed with a different white wine, which tasted and smelled fine. We were told the second wine was drier (as if that makes a difference to the musty smell), the glasses with the musty smelly wine were left on the table throughout the meal, and we were charged for them. Fourthly, and after several days of eating and drinking, we asked to start with a main course each. We were asked didn't we want a salad to start? Er no, if we wanted a salad to start we would have asked for one, Fifthly, the choice of desserts were 'this' or 'that.'

He brings a mix of traditional and innovative Chinise dishes, a mix of meat, fish and seafood with explosive sauces (tomato- and sweet & sour - based).

After reading Tripadvisor reviews we decided on this one. It was also close to our hotel so we could walk and take in some of the sights and nightlife in the plazas. We made reservations and gave ourselves lots of time to get there.When we arrived the dining tables were all set with beautiful linens and cutlery. We were seated at a table for two facing the stage. No craning our necks or turning our chairs around for us! We looked at the plates of food that others were being served and asked for an upgrade. They were very accommodating and even took a discount on the cost because we had bought show tickets before coming. Every course of the meal was delectable. Sauces that had exquisite taste all to themselves and not overpowering the meat or side served. Salad course was delicious; fresh and plentiful. The show started and our waiters quietly continued to cater to our needs and clear and bring the next course. We did not leave hungry! The show itself was just as the other reviews described: enthusiastic, lively, loud and very varied between the singing and dancing. Costumes were vibrant and warrant notice. I believe there was a male guest performer who was a real treat. At the end of the show one must admire their stamina. The other unexpected treat were the walls of the reception area. Here you can view decades of photos of royalty and celebrities who have enjoyed this cafe. At first we thought the prices were high but in retrospect we were given poorer quality of food, less quantity on the plates and for higher prices at other restaurants in Madrid - and no show!

It's hard to figure out what they really are about, the menu reads kind of sophisticated b but in reality not spectacular and missing clear character. Most visitors we saw wee young people sipping their tea or wine. We ordered some food from the main courses list. My tarte flambee with ham and ruccula was very tasty but also very difficult to eat as all ingredients were falling off the pastry basis. My partner's tarte flambee with bacon and onion was mostly about onion and even that was just too dry. Although both dishes were ""main courses"", we both left with lots of room in our stomachs. We found it quite amusing as none of us is a big eater and normally we have the opposite problem. Maybe it's just a place where young women like to come and the portions are suitable for a girl who does not want to risk a surplus of calories.  But it's not cheap for what you get. Maybe I wouldn't be so grumpy if we had more luck with the waiter. Unfortunately the young man was not at his best that night and his effort was kept to correct minimum. I was very disappointed when I ordered tea and in spite of my explicit request for earl grey git just plain English, the bag already in my cup. To make matters worse it turned out later that they actually have a big choice of nice tea flavours but he didn't bother to offer me an my choice.

We booked an early evening show with dinner on a Tuesday. Whilst not full, the atmosphere was great and the flamenco was spectacular and the paella was arguably one of the best we have ever had. For the price we paid the evening was of unbelievable value (paella (too much), bottle of wine, gazpacho starter, bread, ice cream dessert).

I was a little apprehensive as were my family as we had never seen a flamenco show before so we were not sure what to expect. I must admit we were all blown away by the performance, it was amazing. The dancers and singers/musicians put so much effort into it and it was very emotional. Even though there wasn't many in the audience they still put so much effort in for those that were there.  You can just pay for the show and have a drink or you can also order food. We shared a number of small dishes as starters and then had a main and a pudding each, they were nice but the crochets were a little strange. I had the salmon along with my mam and it was lovely, my partner had the veal and my dad had the steak and everyone enjoyed what they had. I must admit the show and the atmosphere were fantastic but I found the food and drink quite expensive, but if you are wanting a traditional Spanish evening I would highly recommend.

We were seated 2 rows from the stage which was very exciting and loud. If you are bothered by loud noise ask for a table further away.

This was my first Flamenco Show so wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Our local hosts said it was very good.

After doing our research about where to eat in Madrid, we made a booking here. Perhaps the process of making a booking should have been a clue--the phone was not answered twice and, on the third call, it was, with the person hanging up the phone after the booking was made without so much as a ""see you later"" or ""thank you."" (Note: the person making the booking speaks Spanish.) We arrived and no one greeted us; after several minutes of waiting, we finally went to the back of the restaurant and asked about the booking. The server pointed to a table and we sat down. Menus were pretty much thrown at us. The major issue at this place was the service: there was one waiter working upstairs and he could care less. He rolled his eyes at customers throughout the night and clearly just did not want to be at work. When we asked him about one dish ([here was one food term on the Spanish menu with which we were unfamiliar (this place does not offer English menus)] we got a eye roll and not very helpful response. Plates were thrown on tables with no commentary; he would have his back turned to walk away before the dish had even stopped moving from the force with which it was placed on the table. The only thing he went out of the way to do was show you how much your enjoyment did not matter to him.  In addition to being rude, the service was also error-prone. We ordered a bottle of wine (he even verified this before walking away) and were served and charged for glasses. We ordered three appetizers and an entree; we were served only two of the appetizers we ordered. The food was forgettable. We began with completely flavorless croquettes; they were basically all bread. The arugula and pumpkin salad was acceptable but overdressed. A chicken caesar sandwich was so drowned in mayo that the sauce fell out of the sandwich when you attempted to eat it and it tasted like nothing else. The decor is cute but the combination of disinterested and rude service and poorly executed food make it tough to call this place anything but terrible. I can't imagine how they would treat a customer who doesn't speak Spanish given how rude they were to Spanish speakers. Don't waste your time here; there are plenty of good options elsewhere in Madrid.",2016-04-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4937390-Reviews-or70-Maricastana_Bar_Kitchen-Madrid.html,UID_55044,0.081,0.854,0.065,-0.6147,-0.0777391975308642,0.3978395061728395,0.4167095238095238,2271,205,0.0902686041391457,0,54,False,79,0.0789473684210526,0.1052631578947368,0.2368421052631578,0.0394736842105263,0.131578947368421,0.0526315789473684,0.0789473684210526,0.0657894736842105,0.131578947368421,0.0789473684210526,412,244,4.512135922330097,0,0,disappoint research eat madrid made book perhap process make book clue phone answer twice third call person hang phone book made without much see later thank note person make book speak spanish arriv one greet us sever minut wait final went back restaur ask book server point tabl sat menu pretti much thrown us major issu place servic one waiter work upstair could care less roll eye custom throughout night clearli want work ask one dish one food term spanish menu unfamiliar place offer english menu got eye roll help respons plate thrown tabl commentari would back turn walk away dish even stop move forc place tabl thing went way show much enjoy matter addit rude servic also error prone order bottl wine even verifi walk away serv charg glass order three appet entre serv two appet order food forgett began complet flavorless croquett basic bread arugula pumpkin salad accept overdress chicken caesar sandwich drown mayo sauc fell sandwich attempt eat tast like noth els decor cute combin disinterest rude servic poorli execut food make tough call place anyth terribl imagin would treat custom speak spanish given rude spanish speaker wast time plenti good option elsewher madrid,very bad review,1,Spanish

Price was reasonable.",2016-10-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2308680-Reviews-or50-Asador_Real-Madrid.html,UID_55071,0.071,0.867,0.062,-0.2424,0.1163333333333333,0.3773333333333334,0.4777272727272728,558,48,0.086021505376344,0,16,False,30,0.074074074074074,0.1851851851851851,0.3333333333333333,0.074074074074074,0.1851851851851851,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.0,0.074074074074074,0.037037037037037,101,75,4.534653465346534,0,0,recommend local four us went littl earli dinner place empti iberica bellota jamon eppit think best bottl local rioja tempranillo wine good dinner roast tender pig fish veget dish us overal food good also tast herbal wine finish waitress speak english shi side give much recommend wine food choic littl disappoint price reason,bad review,2,Mexican
