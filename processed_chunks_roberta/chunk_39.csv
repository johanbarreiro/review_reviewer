The restaurant is in a beautiful historic building that is not far from the Plaza Mayor, but the immediately surrounding streets had no obvious tourists. When we went in at about 2:00, there was a long list of reservations, but we were promptly seated on the third floor. By 3:00 that large dining area was nearly full, and by the time we left all three dining floors were full. Except for our waiter, who spoke excellent English, we heard only Spanish. Service was prompt and attentive. Our waiter recommended the 1/2 roasted lamb to share for two. Olives and delicious croquettes were brought while we waited for the appetizers, which were excellent, as was the roast lamb. After sharing a very cool flan with ice cream, they brought complimentary dark chocolates.

Many people walk by it without realizing that it is a first class restaurant. The management really needs to open its doors or do something to make it more appealing on the outside. The inside is a different story. What a fabulous, inviting place to relax and eat. It has the ambiance of the several hundred year old inn it once was. The staff were exceedingly kind, friendly and attentive. It is the MOST service oriented restaurant on our entire visit to Spain. I think they put all the good servers in Spain, in this one restaurant. White table cloths. Good chairs. Large basket of variety of bread. Tall glasses of ice water.  Best of all, the food was excellent and plating clearly developed/designed by experienced hands. Lamb is their specialty but we had salmon. It was very well prepared. We saw that many of the other diners were well-dressed Madrid businessmen (2PM). They were among the only men wearing suits, having lunch, we had seen on our trip.  In that old inn, next to the huge fireplace, light coming in through ancient, wavy glass windows, I felt connected to another time before cars, cell phones and zippers in clothing.

We wanted a small, cheap dinner and this place delivered. We had a total of 4 drinks (2 beers, 2 glasses of red wine), and 5 empanadas of varying flavors. The crust on the empanadas was excellent, not too soft, not too hard, perfectly flaky.  Service was quick, but as the first customers at opening time on a Sunday (8pm), I'd hope that was the case. The space is small. Really small. Like, less than 10 tables...so get there early like we did. They filled in fast. It's not on the main tourist corner, either, so it felt more like locals were eating with us. The downside is this place was hot inside - as in my husband and I were both sweating. At the end of a long day that's not necessarily what you want, but the drinks were cold and the food tasty, so what can you do?

I ate a lot of really amazing food in Spain so it wasn't the best meal I had overall but it was certainly delicious. Also, the staff was very attentive and friendly despite the fact that our Spanish is terrible. I also appreciated the rustic decor. We had the following: 1. The lamb - comes in a pan, they chop it up in front of you (noticed all the other tables around us had the lamb too). I don't normally eat lamb but this was quite good. 2. Hake stew (fish) - never had this before. It was good but you have to like seafood. 3. Asparagus - traditional green asparagus we eat in the US. Had asparagus a few other times in Spain and was served the big, white soft kind. 4. Sangria (1/2 pitcher) - wow, so very sweet and thick. Much sweeter than the pseudo sangria I've tried in the US. Had to get used to it. Overall I recommend! This place isn't for the budget conscious though! Quite spendy but totally worth it.

The only taste that came through was something akin to distilled white vinegar. We then followed with 'peppers podona' (as close to name as I can recall). This was recommended by our waiter after I requested something on the spicy side. While the peppers presented beautifully, looking like a large pile of grilled jalapenos, they tasted like a simple green pepper.....that is, if you were able to get past all the salt! My husband then had the lamb which he seemed pleased with. I opted for the salmon. It was a nice steak cut size. While I had no problem dealing with all the bones, it was the unbelievable amount of salt coating the top of the fish that kept me from finishing the dish.

The first evening, I attended a large business dinner, which was held in one of the private dining rooms upstairs, and was very impressed with the quality of service, atmosphere, and with my meal. But everything had been pre-ordered, and we were on a very tight schedule, so I chose to return the following evening for a more leisurely dinner. I'm so glad I did. Seated at a comfortable table on the first floor, a delicious aroma permeates the dining room from the wood burning oven one floor below. We ordered a few entree's (ham, olives, and shrimp) but were most impressed with the roasted red piquillo peppers - they are delicious. But our main course, the roasted lamb, was sublime. The lamb is designed for two people, like a chateaubriand might be. (I believe the cut is the front leg and shoulder, but don't quote me on that.) The lamb was meltingly tender, with a crisp outer skin. Who knew lamb could taste so amazing. They're not just for making sweaters anymore.

The atmosphere was calm with a nice bit of jazz playing in the background. The waiter was attentive and helpful and the style above average. The food overall was cooked and served well but it was really very simple. We were here for lunch and had the Menu of the Day for 12 euros and I know you can only expect what you pay for but it is still a higher than average level restaurant so I don't see that as any excuse to offer something too simple. The alternative menu was quite extensive with some interesting looking items but not one single vegetarian option available and there was no offer to suggest an alternative for me so I had to go with fish again. We had soups to start, one was courgette, wild mint and spinach. It was well presented with a drizzle of oil and some garnish and tasted really good. I could taste all the flavours and it was not too salty which is often a real problem. My partner had the salmorejo - a traditional summer soup, served cold. It's a bit of a stretch to class a cold, wet November day as still summer though I have to say! We were served 3 different breads which were fresh, warm and really nice. Our mains were fish balls (hake) and Pollo Ganz (chicken in a pepper, onion and tomato sauce). The 3 fish balls were really nice and light and the chicken was OK but was cut into many small bite sized pieces whereas the chicken would have been much better for taste and texture if perhaps it had been cooked in one piece. The sauces were good but . . . . WHAT IS IT WITH THE SPANISH!!! Why doesn't any main dish get served as a balanced plate with some starchy element (potato, rice, pasta etc) and some vegetables! I just don't get it. How can you call a small plate of just meat and sauce a main meal? I often wonder if any chefs in Spain know that there are vegetables in the world. The dessert was a cheesecake which was well cooked, light and with a good texture but it lacked any real flavour. I would finish by saying that it was nice to eat food cooked nicely but the whole meal really was far too simple showing no real effort from the chef.",2014-11-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4358449-Reviews-or60-Ganz-Madrid.html,UID_32768,0.029,0.834,0.137,0.9933,0.144973544973545,0.5619047619047618,0.2821333333333333,2172,205,0.0943830570902394,5,48,False,94,0.0843373493975903,0.0963855421686747,0.3373493975903614,0.072289156626506,0.180722891566265,0.0120481927710843,0.0120481927710843,0.0481927710843373,0.1325301204819277,0.0240963855421686,415,226,4.236144578313253,0,0,restaur realli good review disappoint mani point atmospher calm nice bit jazz play background waiter attent help style averag food overal cook serv well realli simpl lunch menu day euro know expect pay still higher averag level restaur see excus offer someth simpl altern menu quit extens interest look item one singl vegetarian option avail offer suggest altern go fish soup start one courgett wild mint spinach well present drizzl oil garnish tast realli good could tast flavour salti often real problem partner salmorejo tradit summer soup serv cold bit stretch class cold wet novemb day still summer though say serv differ bread fresh warm realli nice main fish ball hake pollo ganz chicken pepper onion tomato sauc fish ball realli nice light chicken ok cut mani small bite size piec wherea chicken would much better tast textur perhap cook one piec sauc good spanish main dish get serv balanc plate starchi element potato rice pasta etc veget get call small plate meat sauc main meal often wonder chef spain know veget world dessert cheesecak well cook light good textur lack real flavour would finish say nice eat food cook nice whole meal realli far simpl show real effort chef,very good review,5

The hardest part about the restaurant is finding it because in Madrid every street seems to have a different name after each block. To our happy surprise we found the restaurant finally and it was well worth the effort. She had the scallops and I had the duck. I was tempted to go for the lamb because as the waiter told me that it is a traditional Spanish dish, but he also advised me that their duck was better than anything in France. He wasn't kidding. We both agreed this might have been some the best dishes we'd ever had in our lives. Given how much traveling we do that's no small statement. In addition to the wonderful food the staff was really very kind given how little Spanish we speak. The play started getting busy at 9:30 and we were happy we arrived early. The bill was extremely reasonable given that we were in Madrid. I make unreserved recommendation of this restaurant.

Saying that it is not served with veg just a green salad (which is more than enough). The lamb fell off the bone and has to have been one of the most delicious I have ever tasted.

Forget all that. No, it does not have waiters in starched linen, heroic prices, and faux friendly, formal service. Instead, what it does have is much more valuable: quality and fresh ingredients prepared with care and passion, and delivered with friendly and helpful service. The result is beautiful food, creatively prepared and presented. We loved it. My only criticism is that we ordered too much, but that was our heart ruling our head. We would return in a heartbeat.

We don't speak Spanish, and our server, Javier was amazing and accommodating. I wanted to have the famous roasted lamb, but the dish listed in the menu was for two, Javier easily arranged it for one person. I looked at the wine list and asked him about my wine choice, so Javier recommended me another wine but in the same price range, without pushing it any higher. (very good advise). Now - the food. It should be said, that olives, bread and croquets are immediately at your table, even before you start ordering. For starters we had grilled asparagus, grilled ""Padron"" peppers and lamb sweetbreads.  The mains (and there were two nights): roasted lamb (WOW), grilled sea bass, and dear in sauce.  In addition, I asked for sliced tomatos to accompany meats, this was not in the menu, but the waiter brought it right away.  Resume - fantastic food, immaculate service, very cozy place.

Atocha is excellent for the galleries but most of the restaurants are tapas bars or concentrate on lunch time eating. Few of the hotels seemed to have dining rooms. And we do not chose to eat at KFC! So to find this was a joy. We booked on line for the second night ( a Friday) and were shown to a better table when they recognised us as returnees. Not that a there are any bad tables. The scallops were a delight. Sadly we couldn't manage a dessert.

We had tomatoes and cheese with basil ice cream, vegetables with anchovy, tuna with wasabi ice cream, scallops and beef short ribs. Having grown up on seafood in Seattle I tend to be very critical, but the scallops were perfectly cooked and the tuna melted in our mouths. The flavors were delicate and balanced. The vegetarian dishes we ordered had outstanding flavor. I definitely disagree with the recent reviews; maybe they just had a bad day.

The dishes are pieces of art, but unfortunately not a match for their taste. The slowly roasted lamb with couscous and curry sauce (€18,50) was good, but did not excite the taste buds. Not in the league of fine cuisine. Neither the grilled scallops on a bed of potato and cauliflower cream (€17) had delicate taste. Well cooked, but not with delicate taste and texture. Something was missing.  The restaurant itself is beautiful decorated, with a black and white tile floor and creative adjustable desk lamps on the walls.

I can't speak for the smaller original one as it was full when we found it (it only seats about 16 people approx) so they told us to go the other one which we were assured was the same. Ordered a glass of Albariño (very nice) looked at the menu and left. They have absolutely no tapas on the menu which is bizarre given the name and the fact that they crop up regularly on the top ten list of great tapas in Madrid! The menu consists of mainly pizza, a few salads and empanadas, If I'd wanted pizza I'd have gone on holiday to Italy and I wasn't in the mood to eat lots of heavy empanadas. So I'm not criticizing the food in any way, just that it's very misleading and very disappointing if you've walked for 30 minutes to find it and be told that Tinto Y Tapas doesn't serve Tapas.

What a mistake! If you're looking for a hearty breakfast, this place is NOT it (no eggs, for example). If you're looking for a healthy breakfast, this place is also not it (fat yogurt, their only ""cereal"" options are various ""fruit loops"" style things; no oatmeal, no simple, sugarless flakes of any kind). Their main breakfast staple is the bread with tomato paste... except the bread wasn't there when we arrived shortly after they opened, and so we had to sit around the place waiting for their bread to be delivered.

The restaurant is quite small but it has a welcoming and warm atmosphere which was only enhanced by the kindness of the waiters. The food was also great, we tried the salmon tartare with mango (we were a bit sceptical at first because of the odd combination but it was actually great) and the vegetable lasagne. The food was fresh, deliciously made and neatly put. The prices are also reasonable considering the quality of the food and the fact that it's very close to Plaza Major.

I was very impressed with the decor of the restaurant. The rustic look somehow whetted our appetite.  We had a long range of options. Appetizers were Bellota ham, Roasted peppers salad with Tuna, Andalusian fried squid, Scrambled eggs with shrimps and mushrooms, Homemade croquettes, Red sausage from Navarra, Posadero's onions and grilled vegetables.  The bellota ham, roasted peeppers salad, croquettes and grilled vegetables were the best.  For the main course, we had the option to choose from either Roast lamb in quarters cooked in a traditional oven, Fish hake casserole or Rice with vegetables. We were also served lettuce with onion salad and Sliced potatoes as a side dish. The roast lamb was tasty, the rice with vegetables and both starters were excellent. Fo dessert we had Bartolillos, fried milk cake and a pastry. The bartolillos were the best of the lot. Of course we had the standard white and red wines with mineral water or soda. We had coffee at the end of the meal with an option for tea as well. All food items were served in traditional vessels and the cutlery used was also beautiful.

Classic Spanish décor and very polite and attentive service. They have an asador, so the house speciality is cordero asado, so, as they say "" A donde fueres, haz lo que vieres"". As we have noticed with many establishments this year, they padded the bill, which never happened on any of our many previous stays in Madrid over the years. The recommended house wine we ordered (a Marques de Riscal blanco ) was listed as 11,50, but when the bill arrived we were charged 16,00 euros. The other night we were charged for three coffees instead of 2, (not here) which is quite noticeable when there are only 2 of you! Perhaps it is just a sign of the times. It niggles, but it doesn't seem worth haggling over, we just simply adjust our tip accordingly! There was nothing wrong with the meal, but nothing to get excited about, either. One gazpacho, the lamb for 2 (42,00) water, wine, 2 sorbets (6,80 each) and coffee came to 94,00 euros. It ticked the box of eating in a traditional Spanish posada.

First impressions may be a little confusing: is this a typical traditional Spanish restaurant or a tourist trap? Given that it is located in the heart of the restaurant area, it could be either. But in the end we gave it the benefit of the doubt and enjoyed a good meal, in traditional style. All very typical stuff, but one or two tempting excitements: snails in a delicious sauce, arroz with rabbit. Good fish dishes. All served in a place with a good traditional atmosphere, and cheerful, if also traditional service. Plenty of red wines to choose from, but fewer interesting whites, almost all Spanish.

This was our 1st night in Madrid, having arrived from NY early that AM, so I thought a reservation on the ""earlier"" side (Madrid definition of ""earlier"") would be best. Next time, I would do 10 or 11PM. There was only a few other tables of diners when we arrived, but by the time we left most of the tables were filled. The ambiance is wonderful and warm, even from the outside, with a feeling of old Madrid and tradition and aromas pulling you in. We were welcomed warmly and seated at a table next to an adorable old hearth oven. The specialty here is roast suckling lamb which my husband and I shared - It was outstanding. We also had the baked clams appetizer which came with 12 clams and would have been plenty for four people, and the grilled asparagus, and ordered bottle of the house red wine, which was excellent. I thought the service was superb.

It's TINY and has an amazingly diverse menu that delivers fresh, simple food to your table that brings out the best of Spanish flavors (aged manchego, goat cheese with fresh greens, olives, cured meats). Lots of great regional wines and a knowledgeable staff. It is very affordable at well. We had a great time, and look forward to coming back during our next visit to Madrid. One word of warning. The portions are pretty large for ""tapas."" Dishes are really made to be like 2 per person rather than the typical 3-5 for tapas. Just a warning since we ordered way too much food. Also, if I had to skip anything, it would probably be the pizza. The pizza was good, but a little too typical compared to the rest of the amazing menu.

On the face of it, its a little pricey but it was worth every penny! The setting is wonderful, under the stained glass, domed ceiling. The buffet is stupendous with loads of choice and such things as lobster, langoustines, scallops, foie and partridge among the things on offer. The real gems are in the canapes, fish and seafood sections! We were offered champagne on arrival and I suspect you could have drunk as much as you wanted as the staff were always offering to refill our glasses as well as wine and then tea or coffee to follow. To cap it all, a soprano and tenor accompanied on piano entertain you as you eat! Lots of popular numbers and some less well known. They ended with Verdi's Brindisi from 'Traviata' and the waiters refilled our glasses so that the singers could come and 'clink' every one. Service was 'formal' but not at all stuffy.

All the dishes were absolutely delicious, and the three of us felt very satisified with the amount of food we had all had.

Although the breakfast was very good this rating is for our dining experience. Firstly, we had a problem in that although we had made a phone booking there was no record of our call upon arrival. When making the booking our details had to be repeated, for each aspect, because of the lack of understanding of English by the restaurant receptionist , and at the time, we felt there could be problems, which happened! Fortunately, there was one remaining table unallocated for our 7pm arrival. Once seated there seemed to be an abundance of staff scurrying about but we received little attention until we asked to see a wine list.  A combination of patrons, some having evening drinks and some seated for fine dining , possibly is not a good mix for service attention in the same area? Upon asking to be served we were attended by Jorge, who provided a high level of service and good advice on menu choice and the wine list. The menu is extensive , and not unexpected for a in hotel fine dining restaurant. To start, we had a chefs special appetiser of a slice of banana with jelly crystals, which to us was not appetising and should be passed! For entrees we chose the smoked sardines and soup . Both meals were well presented and the broccoli soup quite hot. Our main courses were the salmon and a Caesar salad which was a delicate serving, as a listed starter meal, which was to our liking. The salmon was cooked, as Jorge suggested, being a little rare inside. This meal, relative to the other seafood dishes , was well priced and good value.  The wine list, on an iPad, provided good choices but at hotel prices. We selected a Spanish Verdello white wine which was enjoyable. Overall, this venue started out as another hotel average dining experience, but thanks to Jorge, was turned around into a pleasant evening.

The decoration inside is lovely, but if the weather is good, you can sit at a table outside and enjoy the lovely alley, very close to the Plazuela de San Gines. We ordered an english breakfast (which was OK) and the Brunch Iberico, which was delicious. At 17.50 Euro it is bit pricey, but definitely worth it because the ingredients are of the highest quality and you can eat so many things. It has a spanish potato omellete (Tortilla de patatas), a great selection of jamón ibérico (amazing!), a selection of gourmet breads accompanied by tomato emulsion (breads were fresh, warm and served with butter) and, for desert, churros with hot chocolate.

The restaurant is tucked behind an ancient bar. They claim to specialize in meats, but they don't have either cochinillo or cordero asado, even though these are Castillian specialties.  I had a friend morcilla which was totally overcooked. My wife had a greasy grilled vegetable appetizer (which was cooked on a flat top, not a grill. ) Lunch was a total disappointment, but the bill was a problem.  I can't eat gluten, so we only got one bread, but they charged for two. When I complained, they refused to fix the bill, saying the bread charge was essentially a service charge. Seriously?

We went here after not getting into 2 others (Algarabia and La Candela Resto - and this was on a Tuesday night!) The menu looked a bit sparse and we decided against the ""starters"" since we weren't sure whether they were actually starters or tapas. If the latter, they were a bit expensive, ranging from 10 euros up to 16. If they were starters then they looked rather boring (and expensive). We weren't offered a wine list, and when we asked for one there was only wine on it. No beer or coffee or shorts etc. When we ordered the mains (venison and sea bass) we asked what I think was the head waiter whether there was enough veg/spuds etc. on the plate or whether need to order extra - although there was actually only spuds done three ways (roast, chipped, boiled). He said there was enough on the plate so we went with it. When they came it was a joke! The venison came with a small spud and a slice (yes, one slice) of carrot and some thing green. The sea bass came with some green salad and half a bigger spud. Needless to say we ordered some more! I asked for chipped potatoes. The waiter came back with tomato ketchup. Bizarre. When we asked again (a bit louder, obviously . . we're Brits, after all) he said ""ah yes, pepper!"" We gave up, asked for the menu and pointed to the roast potatoes Instead. When they came, they were sliced and boiled and in a buttery sauce. Your guess is probably as good as mine what the chipped ones were like!

They just don’t have enough staff to serve and clean the table. After we got inside, we noticed this place is actually very big over 3 floors. There are plenty of empty tables. If the staff have been more efficient and more staff available, there is no reason for customers to wait. This is one of the examples I’ve experienced in Spain where the service is very slow and everyone works at a much slower pace to the point that I get frustrated with their inefficiency. Excellent choice of food from basic breakfast to brunch, taste good but I would say you can easily find similar quality in England. You come here to try local cuisine to make sure you try the Spanish dishes. The churros with warm chocolate is nothing special to me, but just ticking the box that I’ve tried it.

On our arrival he was a bag of nerves and genuinely couldn't understand why a couple from London had picked his restaurant above others in the area. It was so refreshing to see someone genuinely shocked by our glowing feedback.  The space is incredibly unique. Both floors are quite different but there's a sense of cool that runs throughout. The artwork that litters the exposed brick walls and the industrial style lighting makes for a great setting.  The food is outstanding. Some French. Some Japanese. All fantastic.  The staff literally cannot do enough for you. You can tell there's a determination within the team to make their new venture work and they're doing just that.  The bar has a great selection of spirits and the cocktails are freshly made and delicious. The passion fruit Mojitos were in full flow that's for sure.

(OK, make that Madrid.) The restaurant is small, basic but decent. The basement has a more intimate atmosphere probably better suited to small groups of friends, families etc. Ground floor has mostly tables for two which are shoe-horned in but this hardly matters once you start eating.  The food is superb. I recommend the pasta with soft-shelled crab - utterly delicious and something hard to resist with each return visit. But everything we have eaten here has been superb, from the fragrant leg of lamb scented with herbs and braised (in wine?) to the wonderful caponata. Servings are quite generous and prices are very moderate for this quality and quantity. Great lunchtime menu deals make it a very affordable option for mid-week lunches too. Service is friendly and attentive. The restaurant seems to be open most of the day so, although a booking is probably advisable, if you can be flexible about the time, it's likely they'll be able to fit you in.

Our waiter chose an Italian wine to go with our meal and it was an excellent choice. The menu tended towards more meaty entries although there were a number of salad starters and seafood pastas.

This sounded weird to us because we were quite sure that we would have had to pay less (we were 4, a friend of us hadn’t even ordered anything to eat and we had split some dishes). Then the waiter told us that we could have paid 3 euros less if we wanted (we only wanted the bill to check it ). We asked for the receipt because we simply wanted to see what had made the price higher than expected and when the waiter gave it to us we eventually found out that the price was actually 10 euros less than what he had told us. Not a big deal, but it was quite weird that when the waiter gave us the difference he didn’t apologize for the mistake (that could have happened), but made fun of us with another client in Spanish thinking that we couldn’t understand him (only because we asked for a normal bill and didn’t want to pay anything on an oral basis )!

When we arrived there was a queue but it did not take long at all o be seated, the staff were very efficient. The menu was much bigger than the one I had seen online which was great because I had previously thought my choices limited to breakfast options. They had many lunch and dinner choices. My friend and I both ordered Brunch plates and they were HUGE. My friend's dish (Iberian Brunch) came with 'breads' and she ended up with three or four mini baguettes which were warm too. My meal was equally as impressive and they also bought me extra bread which wasn't featured on the menu. I have a big appetite and I was honestly full for hours after finishing this. Normally I wouldn't pay €17 for a Brunch but the quantity of food and the fact it includes both orange juice and a coffee/tea honestly has me planning my next trip. What I Would say is that although they do offer the odd vegan pastry this seems to be more of a tokenistic gesture than something actually worthy of. I think adding the option to swap eggs for tofu scramble or greek yogurt for soya yogurt or something like that would make a big difference :)",2019-10-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8134432-Reviews-or10-La_Rollerie_Calle_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_33066,0.021,0.794,0.185,0.9924,0.2490259740259739,0.4731601731601731,0.35178,1168,110,0.0941780821917808,0,21,False,35,0.125,0.15,0.4,0.025,0.225,0.025,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,219,152,4.337899543378995,0,0,went friend saturday morn arriv queue take long seat staff effici menu much bigger one seen onlin great previous thought choic limit breakfast option mani lunch dinner choic friend order brunch plate huge friend dish iberian brunch came bread end three four mini baguett warm meal equal impress also bought extra bread featur menu big appetit honestli full hour finish normal pay brunch quantiti food fact includ orang juic coffe tea honestli plan next trip would say although offer odd vegan pastri seem tokenist gestur someth actual worthi think ad option swap egg tofu scrambl greek yogurt soya yogurt someth like would make big differ,good review,4

With a rambunctious two year old in tow, we decided to sit next to the kitchen. This made it convenient to give our compliments to the chefs as we were leaving.

(More avocado please!! Oh so delicious!!) We continued with the best udon I've ever had (although I know the goal of this restaurant isn't fusion, I feel like this traditional udon has fused with genius and become multicultural, modern and fantastic.)  The chirashi we ate was lovely, my husband is still wishing he could prepare rice like that. And we wondered the entire way home what made the mashed potatoes with the beef so incredibly fabulous.

We went for the 30 euro deal which is for two people. They did not provide an English menu but the waiter translated as much as he could and obviously we did not mind anyway!  The deal includes some olives to begin. We were then given bread which we paid extra for but did not mind as it was needed. We then got 4 cold tapas (salmon was amazing). Next 4 hot tapas came all of which were great. Lastly 3 dessert tapas came and they were all very good (a fruity type of mousse, chocolate brownie, and cheesecake). It's very nice inside and service was good and not slow. We went at 8 on a Saturday night without booking and we were seated right away. It became busy by the time we left.  We also had a jug of sangria which was nice and quite cheap (I think about 13 euros) - it was a massive jug. Overall the food was delicious and excellent for the price!

I thought I would do the same. Oh my goodness!!!  2 pieces of toasted bread arrived, along with 2 slices of jamon Serrano and a wonderful tomato sauce (I tried to get the recipe, but shhhhh, was told it was a secret). Wow wow wow. I had 3 times the same breakfast, that's how much I loved it. Ok, not on the same day :-).  The funny thing is, instead of ordering tea or coffee, I thought I should be more original and ordered a chocolate. Well, a sumptuous thick chocolate made my day! It's the chocolate you typically get with churros; the chocolate itself resembles the Italian ciobar, for those familiar with it? So if you enjoy thick chocolate, brilliant, otherwise, if you want the regular hot chocolate, you have to ask for a Nesquick chocolate. Also, lots of place offer a natural zumo de naranja, a natural orange juice. Wait for the best: toasts, jamon and tomato (plus tea or coffee or nesquick chocolate) for 3.50euros.

First of all, the food: We had the house maki roll (x2), the reblochon omelette, the sardinas tempura and the chirasi. The maki roll was very original and with a good balance of flavours. The reblochon omelette was also very nice and perfectly done. We didnt love the Chirasi because the tuna and the white fish were nothing special. The prawns were quite good and the salmon also. The last dish, the tempura sardines, they recommended it as the best dish they had. I found this dish quite terrible: the tempura was thick and oily and the fish inside was lacking the texture of fresh fish. We also found that flavours did not match. I honestly cannot understand how they consider this their best dish. Regading the service, they were very nice and helpful but a bit long, given that they only had 2 tables that night. We took more than 2 hours to eat these 4 dishes with no dessert. Also, we did not love the music, it was too much of a mix of african, spanish and oriental songs (I think) which did not go that much together and was annoying at some points. I think the price is fair, but not a bargain like previous reviewers stated: we had 5 dishes (only one main), two beers, some wine and a coffee and we paid 65 €. Also, note that it is not fusion of french and japanese, but the menu is divided between japanese dishes and french dishes.",2013-05-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3745959-Reviews-or80-L_Artisan_Furansu_Kitchen-Madrid.html,UID_33116,0.084,0.819,0.097,0.1643,0.2283236808236807,0.4831917631917631,0.6057571428571429,1429,125,0.0874737578726382,0,40,False,64,0.0769230769230769,0.2115384615384615,0.3461538461538461,0.0384615384615384,0.1538461538461538,0.0384615384615384,0.0192307692307692,0.0192307692307692,0.0576923076923076,0.0384615384615384,264,157,4.412878787878788,0,0,read previou great critic expect high place first food hous maki roll x reblochon omelett sardina tempura chirasi maki roll origin good balanc flavour reblochon omelett also nice perfectli done didnt love chirasi tuna white fish noth special prawn quit good salmon also last dish tempura sardin recommend best dish found dish quit terribl tempura thick oili fish insid lack textur fresh fish also found flavour match honestli cannot understand consid best dish regad servic nice help bit long given tabl night took hour eat dish dessert also love music much mix african spanish orient song think go much togeth annoy point think price fair bargain like previou review state dish one main two beer wine coffe paid also note fusion french japanes menu divid japanes dish french dish,average review,3

Do note that you get tempura fish as part of the appetizers of the house. The sardines are in big what the appetizers are in small. Other appetizers were olives (who were delicous by the way!) Avocado and green apple salad with mustard sauce was our second starter. As said, a bit too much mustard in there.But overall very tasty and very well presented. As main dish we took the chicken and the sting ray. Both were excellent. We took a house wine that was simple and very fair priced (10 euro botttle) All in a, we paid 56 euro for all this plus water and gin tonic.

This is not your typical fusion restaurant, rather it presents elements of French and Japanese cuisines separately but it in such a way that they complement each other in such to create a harmonious and cohesive whole. I strongly recommend the Ceviche with Wakame, House Roll, Duck Magret, Roasted miso-marinated Butterfish, and Pan-seared Ray with seasonal greens and lardons.

I mentioned that it was our anniversary when I made the reservation but nothing was done for it like it was for our 20th anniversary. The food and service were still fairly good (the lamb was a little bit overdone) but it just didn’t have that special touch like the last two times I ate there. The waiters were in a bit of a hurry to remove our plates which made it feel rushed. I also noticed American music being played overhead. I want to hear Spanish music in a Spanish restaurant, not American music. It just did not have the same feel as our previous two visits and that’s why I’m only giving it 3 stars.

Our evening consisted of the following perfectly made dishes. We both had the Green apple salad with avocado, and then Avocado and Salmon tartar with a touch of dill, yummy. I was up for some sushi so I had the House roll which had tuna, salmon, wild sea bass and guacamole, the guacamole was a really unexpected touch on the sushi.

I had a pancake with honey, there was honey everywhere, way too much.

I was in Colon (along Calle Genova) which I thought I knew very well until I stumbled across this great little crepe restaurant. The atmosphere was contemporary but friendly and the two guys working there (Portuguese Manager and Spanish Chef) were both really friendly and professional too. Both spoke English as well as Spanish and I discovered that the owner of this restaurant is British and that he has a chain of restaurants but that this is their first in Madrid and has been open for 3 months now (probably why I hadn´t noticed it before!!!). After looking at their extensive menu (in Spanish and English) I ordered ""La Prep"" (a savoury pancake with cheese, ham (English style), and egg) and I had it with extra tuna. The ingredients were fresh and generous and the pancake was a great size enough to fill me up completely but without being overwhelming. I also asked for a drink they didn´t have but they told me I could chose from the fridge and so I chose apple juice. I was later told that they normally offer this to children who come in as it helps offer them something they (and parents!) like. They were also very happy for me to take the pancake that I couldn´t finish in the restaurant away with me and packed it in a nice plastic container for me as a take-away. In summary, Prep La Crepe is a lovely cafe style restaurant with friendly and family orientated attentive staff who serve great food and make you feel at home as you enjoy your meal. The price was also reasonable and was fair for the large portion I received. I would thoroughly recommend this little restaurant and will definitely be going back there myself very soon!",2015-06-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7819507-Reviews-or20-Prep_La_Crepe-Madrid.html,UID_33175,0.008,0.784,0.209,0.9976,0.2363705738705738,0.4233821733821734,0.4822833333333333,1721,155,0.0900639163277164,5,36,False,70,0.1388888888888889,0.1388888888888889,0.3194444444444444,0.0277777777777777,0.2083333333333333,0.0138888888888888,0.0138888888888888,0.0277777777777777,0.0694444444444444,0.0416666666666666,311,189,4.536977491961415,0,0,two day ago found time kill feel hungri colon along call genova thought knew well stumbl across great littl crepe restaur atmospher contemporari friendli two guy work portugues manag spanish chef realli friendli profession spoke english well spanish discov owner restaur british chain restaur first madrid open month probabl notic look extens menu spanish english order la prep savouri pancak chees ham english style egg extra tuna ingredi fresh gener pancak great size enough fill complet without overwhelm also ask drink told could chose fridg chose appl juic later told normal offer children come help offer someth parent like also happi take pancak finish restaur away pack nice plastic contain take away summari prep la crepe love cafe style restaur friendli famili orient attent staff serv great food make feel home enjoy meal price also reason fair larg portion receiv would thoroughli recommend littl restaur definit go back soon,very good review,5

On the contrary, one of the most professional wait staff and friendly service I've seen in 35 years of living and visiting Madrid. Had the Cordero Asado for lunch, very delicious and plentiful. The wine list is also very good in regional selections. This is not a budget place and quite pricey and expected for traditional restaurants of this caliber, it matches the price range of similar locations in Madrid. So, no big surprises if you understand this, if it's your very first time to enjoy this Spanish cuisine. Very nice old rustic atmosphere for a reason, no modernization required as some complainers persist. Don't expect a perfect meal in these traditional restaurants. It's exceptional for being in a tourist location. So, of course the quality and prices change through the decades. So, DON'T try to relive old memories of the this place.

With a mission to showcase the harmonious relationship between the two cuisines, L’artisan Furansu Kitchen creates a unique menu each weekday, relative to the goods available in the market. This ensures each dish is always at its freshest and crafted using the finest ingredients possible.  With three different dining areas to choose from, including the intimate castiza for date nights, and the bar area which serves European and Japanese cocktails and libations, my friend and I opted for the room which allowed us to see our food being prepared in the kitchen. Exciting to watch the chef’s in action as they prepared our lunch, and our server was helpful in explaining the menu and the dining options. We shared a starter of mackerel tartare, with green onion, ginger and aubergine caviar. I hadn’t tasted anything like this before, and it was a great way to set the tone of our lunch. The subtle flavors of ginger and green onion perfectly reflected the Japanese influence. The soft pork belly was slow cooked for 12 hours, and the sweet soy sauce complimented the tender meat.  My friend ordered the oven-roasted butterfish, marinated in saikyo miso and she couldn’t stop raving about it. I enjoyed a rack of lamb served with yucca fritters. The yucca fritters were something completely new and exciting, and a great take on a root vegetable. The lamb was meaty, juicy, and just right.  Dessert included rhubarb crumble with custard cream and green tea ice cream with mochi and dorayaki. We couldn’t decide which we liked better, because both were so delicious, so we just shared them and ate both!

Boy, was I wrong. After reading the many positive reviews Prep La Crepe had on different websites, I finally decided to try it out and was not disappointed. From the unpretentious décor to the extremely welcoming and friendly staff (who knew this could be possible in Madrid, and on Calle Genova of all places?) the atmosphere is extremely positive and invites you to relax and enjoy yourself. As if that wasn’t enough, the food is pretty great and the prices are very reasonable. Though the “menu del dia” will always give you the better deal anywhere you go, fear not if you come here for dinner or during the weekend. If you order a small salad as well as a crepe and a drink, then the price will be practically the same and the experience will be just as lovely. Although my personal experience was probably perfect due to a combination of factors, I would definitely like to thank the staff for being so professional and for politely answering every single question and request from their customers, no matter how silly or random these were (from swapping cold water for room temperature water to asking how many stairs there are to the bathroom). Who knows? Maybe the trend of having both great food and great service in a single place will actually catch on and Madrid will become just a little more pleasant.",2016-07-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7819507-Reviews-or10-Prep_La_Crepe-Madrid.html,UID_456,0.023,0.743,0.234,0.9965,0.1845736986590645,0.579052370393834,0.6428900000000001,1504,129,0.0857712765957446,0,24,False,62,0.1142857142857142,0.1714285714285714,0.2571428571428571,0.0857142857142857,0.1857142857142857,0.0285714285714285,0.0285714285714285,0.0142857142857142,0.0857142857142857,0.0285714285714285,265,173,4.679245283018868,0,0,pass place mani time never realli bother tri look particularli remark sushi shop next door alway seem like better option boy wrong read mani posit review prep la crepe differ websit final decid tri disappoint unpretenti cor extrem welcom friendli staff knew could possibl madrid call genova place atmospher extrem posit invit relax enjoy enough food pretti great price reason though menu del dia alway give better deal anywher go fear come dinner weekend order small salad well crepe drink price practic experi love although person experi probabl perfect due combin factor would definit like thank staff profession polit answer everi singl question request custom matter silli random swap cold water room temperatur water ask mani stair bathroom know mayb trend great food great servic singl place actual catch madrid becom littl pleasant,good review,4

My friend and I could not stop raving over the food during the entire meal at L'Artisan. We knew a french Japanese spot was an odd choice but we were feeling like something different after several days of tapas. Had I known how spectacular our experience was to be, we would have planned more meals here. The sav blanc (offered by the glass) was exquisite... Frankly one of the best I've ever had. We shared the house roll, avocado-Apple salad and butterfish and were blown away with every course.

Located on Calle Baja surrounded by many tapas places, but it was tranquil inside with great ambiance. It was established in 1625, hence it is older than Botin rest, an overrated and overhyped place that we didn't enjoy. We were greeted warmly and escorted to the second floor dining room to a beautiful table with table cloth. We ordered a fine bottle of cava. We had two starters- grilled octopus, and sardines under oil, they were delightfully prepared and delicious. We had a whole striped bass that was grilled to perfection and was moist, tender and filling with grilled tomato and potatoes. We shared a flan for desert which superb.

Posada de la Villa does open on Monday nights & the Trip Advisor reviews were good so we booked online a week before our holiday. Since my dinner companion is particularly fond of lamb we decided in advance we'd have the shared lamb for two which seems to be the restaurant's signature dish. Several reviewers had posted it was the best lamb they'd ever had so we were fairly confident we were in for a good meal. The restaurant was easy to find - easy walking distance from the Plaza Mayor, Calle Cava Baja & the surrounding streets are full of restaurants. No problem with our booking when we arrived & staff were friendly & (thankfully) spoke decent english. This is a nice looking restaurant - traditional & smart but not enough to make you feel uncomfortable. Service was very good - our waiter was attentive without being intrusive & we were well looked after. From memory I think we had house wine, but whatever it was it was good & not expensive. And the lamb? Well it really is as good as everyone says. Easily the best lamb I have ever tasted - absolutely delicious. If you are visiting Madrid I really recommend this place - its attractive, you'll be well looked after & it won't break the bank.

We love this restaurant so much, it's our favourite in Madrid! The first time we visited was for the set lunch menu, we weren't impressed, there was nothing special about it. We decided we needed to return for the evening menu, and we were so impressed. The menu is a selection of hot and cold 'fusion' tapas. Everything we've tried has been beautifully presented and so tasty. We recommend the Tasting Plate for 2 if it's your first visit, also this is very good value as for 30€ you get a lot of food - cold starters, hot dishes and dessert. The service is very quick and efficient. The surroundings are artistic and quirky. They play very loud music which is not our type of music as a more mature diner, but we put up with it for the quality of the food. The restaurant is always busy, but it's possible to book online for the first evening sitting at 8.30pm. We've found Sunday evening is much quieter. They are open all day serving different things at different times from breakfast, lunch, afternoon snacks to dinner. The menu and website are all in Spanish, the waiters seem to only speak Spainish also.

However, we returned last week on Saturday the 28th September 2017 in the evening and were left very disappointed, and somewhat hungry. Pretty much straight away we noticed that the service wasn´t up to much, we were asked what we wanted within minutes of sitting down, but on asking for a couple more minutes to decide, they forgot to come back and ask us. Anyway, that was a minor gripe that can be forgiven. Eventually we ordered black rice and squid and a salmon tart with Italian style toast. It must be pointed out that at this stage people who came in after us had finished their food and were paying when our food finally arrived. As for the wine, I ordered a glass of ribera, which tasted of headache. I later ordered a glass of rioja, and although marginally more drinkable, tasted like it had come from a bottle that had been open for a while. The food looked delicious, but unfortunately I think more time had gone into making it look pretty than how it tasted. The salmon was nice, but as my girlfriend pointed out, you go to a restaurant to eat food that you can´t make at home, and this was something that both of us could have quite easily knocked out in 30 minutes. The accompanying Italian style bread was so hard it was inedible so we left it. I would feel embarrassed serving it up, so I´ve no idea why they thought they could get away serving it. As for the portion size, it was little more than a tapa.  As for the black rice and little squid, it was nice, but again nothing special, and more like a tapa. So, still hungry, we decided to order another main to share between us, we chose a burger as it seemed like a safe option. And then of course came another extremly long wait despite there being only one other couple at this stage that were eating. The burger, when it arrived, was okay, although, and I think this is more of a Spanish thing, the meat was red raw in the middle. What was annoying though was that we could see the staff fawning over a couple in their 70s next to us, with three members of staff serving them, asking how their food was etc. Not once did anyone ask how our food was. It´s a shame because the restuarant looks dead cute, and is nicely decorated, with a good location.  But the staff could not have been less pleased to serve us and it really showed. I´m not sure if it´s because we looked like tourists, I guess we do, but we both speak Spanish well. It goes without saying that we didn´t tip and went somewhere else for dessert. And it´s not often I leave a bad review, but when I compare it to a meal we had the night before somewhere at a Sushi restaurant in Madrid, we realised how bad it really was.

We then shared the 1/2 roasted lamb, a speciality of the house, and while I almost never eat lamb, this was so tasty and succulent i cleaned my plate. We shared the Caramel Custard.

Order 5-6 tapas to share among 2 people. Prepare to ooh and aha. Food is made for you from scratch and there are some fantastic and healthy options - an avocado salad/dip that you mix yourself and that is simply heavenly, and ceviche with avocado served on lime slices that is now my favorite dish here. Less healthy but just as exquisite and recommended are the BOMBA - a potato stuffed with beef stew and covered with pea sauce, unbelievably rich and delicious, and the FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, yes really. They do a modern twist on this dish, with feta and fig jam and arugula salad, so you get sweet, salty, bitter and savory all at once, incredible. Highly, highly recommended.  The only downside is that the quality isn't 100% consistent.

Walking by in the afternoon, we noticed a private get-together was underway and decided to return, at least for a drink in the bar. Once inside, we were immersed in the character of the establishment and decided to stay for dinner. Not only was the service impeccable, the food was wonderful! Our lamb was perhaps the best anywhere and the enormous veal chop was tasty. The clientele was obviously Spanish as opposed to being mainly tourists although it is a short walk from Plaza Mayor. I definitely suggest giving it a try. Having said all these positive things, let me mention that we returned for the house specialty, Cocido Madrileno. While in Madrid, there was an article how one should try the ""capital's signature dish"".

Service is friendly and quick. Most people have a small draft beer and a cod fritter each. The fritters are fantastic: they are big, flaky, salty, and succulent on the inside. The batter is well-made and tasty and goes very well with the fish, which is of very good quality. They also do a couple of other tapas, I tried a small, fried tuna empanada and a piece of battered and fried sardine (or herring - this was in a different batter to the cod that wasn't as good). These were okay, but a bit greasy and nothing special, so I would suggest following the locals: to have a drink and a piece of cod (or several...) and move on to another bar.  Casa Revuelta is more of a bar than a restaurant and there isn't a full menu, so you couldn't have an entire sit down tapas lunch or dinner, but it's perfect for a drink and a snack or as part of a tapas crawl. Well worth a trip for the fritters, the lively, fun, boisterous atmosphere and an authentic Madrid experience.

We had seen this place on a foodie video on Youtube. We were in Madrid for 4 nights and visited twice.  On our first visit, about 19:30, it was jam packed with locals, doing what they do best, eating tapas with a beer/wine and having a chat. We managed to get a spot at the bar. We had a couple of cana (small beers) and also tried the vermut. They also serve red wine in small cups. We ordered 2 bacalao each. Absolutely to die for. Crispy batter with melt in the mouth fish inside. Don't be put off by the salted cod, it's not overly salty, tasted perfectly seasoned. Bacalao was €3 per piece, drinks were a mere €1.50. We paid at the end and gave €5 tip, the owner then gave us 2 drinks in return! Humble owners who know what they offer.

The menu del dia was very good value though and enjoyed by the people who had ordered it. It is a small restaurant and lots of tables arrived at the same time meaning service was a little sporadic as there was only one person serving.

I had a large group of university students with me, most of whom had arrived in Spain on a long-haul flight within the previous 12 hours. Being tired and jet-lagged, there was no way they were going to survive until 9pm or so, the usual time a restaurant in Madrid would be serving dinner. Emma very kindly agreed to open early for us, and to seat all 28 of us in her small restaurant. Vanessa was on the front desk and managed the evening with our guests - she was amazingly and generously helpful. Her English was excellent, which helped a great deal as my Spanish is pretty basic. A couple of English-language menus were on hand, which made it easy for everyone in the group to order. The food was outstanding. I had the slow-cooked pork cheeks, which were beautiful. The salad course was wonderful - possibly the best I've ever had. Everything on the menu looked wonderful. It was a little more expensive than the usual 'menu of the day' that many Spanish bars and restaurants offer. But it was very good value for what they served. 28 Euros per person covered a number of tapas plates for entre, an enormous salad course, a fantastic a la carte main course, and drinks. We took the students out for churros for dessert, though we would have had a better end to our meal if we'd stayed at Emma's. This was definitely the food highlight of my stay in Madrid. We returned a few days later as a smaller group, but I wish we could have come back more often. We'll definitely return when in Madrid.",2017-08-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5946751-Reviews-or40-Emma_cocina-Madrid.html,UID_33348,0.011,0.791,0.198,0.9954,0.2571456916099773,0.5444501133786849,0.3392058823529411,1575,137,0.0869841269841269,0,42,False,71,0.0833333333333333,0.2166666666666666,0.35,0.0833333333333333,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0666666666666666,0.0,289,191,4.453287197231834,0,0,outstand experi emma cocina visit madrid june larg group univers student arriv spain long haul flight within previou hour tire jet lag way go surviv pm usual time restaur madrid would serv dinner emma kindli agre open earli us seat us small restaur vanessa front desk manag even guest amazingli gener help english excel help great deal spanish pretti basic coupl english languag menu hand made easi everyon group order food outstand slow cook pork cheek beauti salad cours wonder possibl best ever everyth menu look wonder littl expens usual menu day mani spanish bar restaur offer good valu serv euro per person cover number tapa plate entr enorm salad cours fantast la cart main cours drink took student churro dessert though would better end meal stay emma definit food highlight stay madrid return day later smaller group wish could come back often definit return madrid,very good review,5

The restaurant is located in the old Madrid, south of the beautiful Plaza Mayor. The place has been well kept and remodeled. The furniture gives the place a somehow rustic, historic character. We used the second floor dinning area. My parents went up in a convenient elevator. The stairs were comfortable fot the rest of the group. The food was great. Prior to order anything, they served complimentary ""croquetas"" for everybody. A fried dough made with wheat flour, soft in the inside, not too salty, not greasy at all. Following Dimitri, our waiter, recomendations, I ordered apetizers, three plates, to distribute along the never ending table. Each plate was filled with a variety made up of cured ham, salami, chorizo, and manchego cheese (cured cheese made with sheep´s milk). I wanted to share also one portion of ""callos a la madrileña"". This is a local typical dish made with stomach and other parts of cows or pigs cooked in a delicious juice with condiments, portions of chorizo, and morcilla (blood sausage). I really liked it. My wife (canadian from Montreal) did not want to try it, and she missed a great experience of flavors, and textures difficult to explain with words. For the main dish, I followed Dimitri´s suggestion, and tried lamb. It was tender and the flavor subtle and delicious. I also tried some mushrooms ordered by my father (already 89-year-old and still going) who ordered some fish later. Some ordered veggi dishes. The experience was great as a whole. The meal was accompanied by my favorite red wine, Marques de Riscal (rioja). The prize for 13, with appetizers for everybody, 5 bottles of Marques de Riscal (maybe 6), coffe and dessert, and tip, was about 800 US dollars. I was busy talking and missed dessert. My son, now 16, ""all american"" palate, enjoyed ""leche frita"". As we were leaving, a small, old shaped key was given to everyone of us. This souvenir is given to all the customers, as if it was the key to enter the inn. It was a great experience and the food was rated ""very good"" by everybody in the party. The service was great. By the way, the restrooms were clean. Maybe it was the company and the great time we had, but I am not able to recall any minuses.",2014-12-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d896751-Reviews-or200-Posada_de_la_Villa-Madrid.html,UID_33375,0.014,0.887,0.099,0.9846,0.2761111111111112,0.5375213675213676,0.283775,2374,181,0.0762426284751474,0,95,False,86,0.0625,0.2291666666666666,0.3541666666666667,0.0208333333333333,0.2083333333333333,0.0208333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.0208333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.0,417,264,4.695443645083933,0,0,visit madrid spain christma decid eat la posada de la villa restaur inn restaur exist sinc restaur locat old madrid south beauti plaza mayor place well kept remodel furnitur give place somehow rustic histor charact use second floor din area parent went conveni elev stair comfort fot rest group food great prior order anyth serv complimentari croqueta everybodi fri dough made wheat flour soft insid salti greasi follow dimitri waiter recomend order apet three plate distribut along never end tabl plate fill varieti made cure ham salami chorizo manchego chees cure chees made sheep milk want share also one portion callo la madril local typic dish made stomach part cow pig cook delici juic condiment portion chorizo morcilla blood sausag realli like wife canadian montreal want tri miss great experi flavor textur difficult explain word main dish follow dimitri suggest tri lamb tender flavor subtl delici also tri mushroom order father alreadi year old still go order fish later order veggi dish experi great whole meal accompani favorit red wine marqu de riscal rioja prize appet everybodi bottl marqu de riscal mayb coff dessert tip us dollar busi talk miss dessert son american palat enjoy lech frita leav small old shape key given everyon us souvenir given custom key enter inn great experi food rate good everybodi parti servic great way restroom clean mayb compani great time abl recal minus,very good review,5

You can smell the Calamari before you even arrive. The sandwiches are huge and overflowing with perfectly cooked calamari. They are so big that you begin to worry that you may not be able to fit that thing in your mouth. But, where there's a will, there's a way. Pair that sandwich with an ice cold beer and you are in heaven. If you go on a nice sunny day on the weekend chances are you have to stand outside and eat with all the rest of the people, mostly Spanish people who trek into town to have a great sandwich.

It was our first meal in Spain, and it set the bar high especially for calamares! The kids devoured their calamares bocadillos (little sandwiches). I had the classic Spanish torta (potato/egg tort) and my husband had a jamon bocadillo, all downed with ice-cold cerveza. The staff spoke NO English but were extremely warm and friendly. The place was half full about 6 people in back (that's how small it was) at 2pm and NO tourists. All locals, mostly an older crowd. There were many who came to eat standing at the stainless steel bar ordering a plate of calamares or a bocadillo with cerveza, then would leave within 15minutes to eat & chat. The staff seemed to know everyone who came in -- like a local neighborhood hang out. An elderly couple came in to eat standing up and started talking to us in Spanish as if they knew us.
