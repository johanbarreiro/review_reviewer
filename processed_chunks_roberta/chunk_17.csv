We order drinks, tapas and a main meal. To be honest the main meal did not arrive until after we received our check. We were ok with this since we were very full. We did not accept the main course and there was no trouble. The price was taken off our bill and the restaurant gave us an after dinner drink and dessert on the house.

After another 25 minutes 2 out of the 4 ordered main courses were served, but were cold.  The ordered starter never arrived at our table. After complaining, the cold steak and potatoes were returned to the kitchen and did not come back again. The two missing plates came after another half hour. When we asked about the steak that was returned cold to the kitchen, the waitress brought back a ‘burned’ piece of meet.... We called for the manager, who as the waitress, spoke only some basic words of english, and did not understand the point of our complaints and frustration. Finally we gave it up. Finished the two plates of rips, that were ok and asked for the bill. In the end we paid for the wine and 3 main courses. The water, starter, and 4th plate were for free ! Conclusion: The 2 plate of rips were good, the burger was bearly warm, but still ok, the sirlon steak was first cold and then ‘burned’ - a real nightmare. The waitress cocked it all up with the order and service and did not even try to fix it. The manager wanted to solve the situation by offering more food for free and it took him until we left the restaurant to apologize for the mess.

The waiters were really utterly helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere was very cozying. If you arrive around nine in the evening be prepared for a slight waiting list but you will be seated eventually within 10-15 minutes. First of all remember ro get half portions of whatever you want to try. You will be amazed of how big are rhe half portions. Do try the huevos rotos - eggs with chips and crunchy bacon, the ropa vieja - meat stew slightly flavored with cumin accompanied with chips, the gampas al ajilo - spiced and garlicky prawns and the solomillo al muscatel - pork with sausage and wine sauce. The bacalao with the goat cheese was a bit more fragrant of the goat that i wished so unless you are a ""chèvre"" lover you can skip this dish. The Napolitano tiramisu is also a must try.

We sat on the bar so we were able to see the amonts of drinks returned by customers. Regarding tspas they used tons of lemon in every dish.

They do have vegan options but not very many and the staff is very helpful but doesn't seem to understand what being vegan means (they recommended me dishes with cheese and eggs). Other than that the staff is very nice and attentive. The place was crowded and it was very loud in there. I would recommend booking a table in advance as it was full when we came and the only free table was the one we had reserved. They had live music in the bar and I'm sorry but it sounded absolutely awful. It sounded like amateur karaoke and only contributed to the high noise level in the bar.

I tried six different dishes and not a single one was interesting, tasty or good. Some of the dishes were particularly awful (I have not ever tried worst ""croquetas"" in my life). The service was as bad as the food. There was a perfect lack of coordination among them, they would ask the same thing several times or they would not ask at all. Clumsy and amateurish. Sometimes an awful, loud sound noise came out of the music speakers and a guy would just say sorry but didn't correct the problem.

However it is getting so busy that you have to book really far in advance and the last time I went the service was dreadful. They brought all our food at once about 1minute after ordering so half went cold by the time we had got to eating it.  Then after 1hr15 of being there I could tell they just wanted us to leave.

We were welcomed at the door by Helena who told us that the restaurant was full (and it was barely 8.30) but there were seats for us at the bar, which was great as we could see the cocktails being expertly mixed and the buzz in the kitchen where everyone was giving it 110%! Great atmosphere and great service from Guillermo who guided us through the not so huge, but really inviting Menu. We chose Beetroot Gaspacho, a beet Hummus with crispy pitta bread and spicy Potato Wedges dressed with a deliciously spicy mayo, which was enough for my wife - but I went on to order the Iberico Ribs served with small new potatoes cooked in the oven with a coriander sauce. Best ribs ever! Hugely meaty, marvellously tender, the thick glaze and the unusual coriander side were absolutely perfect. A few minutes away from the Plaza Mayor, seek it out. We made it there on our last night there - so no chance of returning (this time around)! we had a beer and two glasses of Rioja all for less than 40 euros!

We stopped by for lunch, and we had such a good experience here that we made an on-the-spot reservation for dinner for the very next day! The squid ink paella and the veal bavette in particular were simply outstanding! Best paella we had throughout our three-week Spain visit, and we would recommend anyone in the area to give it a try.

When we arrived just before 6 pm, the place was empty and we sat down close to the entrance. However after being there for a while and ordering we were asked to move ""due to a large reservation"" for our table. This was strange because we were the only customers. Later on we discovered that the people who reserved it were a group of young people, obviously trendier bait to sit close to the entrance and catch possible customers. They moved us to the back of the restaurant far from the kitchen/waitress. When we ordered, the waitress didn't write anything down. Obviously, she made a few mistakes bringing us drinks we didn't order and forgetting the water. She also forgot one of the tapas. Her excuse when we complained was that she wanted to give us time to eat the other tapas (???). After being delayed by her mistake we asked the manager who was passing by for another tapa. He forgot to tell the waitress/kitchen and we had to get up again to order. Nobody apologized at all for the bad service, they didn't seem to care about us, what a shame.

Setting is very, very nice, food was excellent, service was prompt and polite, and prices were reasonable. This contemporary spot is owned by the same people that operate Rosi La Roca (equally excellent but with different vibe). We ate one night (without reservations) at the bar by the front window. On the 2nd night, we reserved and had a beautiful table at the back plate glass wall that looks onto a very pleasant garden setting. Julia and Nico took care of us on our 2nd night and gave unparalleled attention and service. During our 2 visits, we had tapas or supertapas of gazpacho, hummus, anchovies (seared at the table with a torch), tropical salad, a cheese dish called “it’s not a tomato” (because it looks like a tomato), pollo gamberrro, trampantojo risotto, and cheesecake. All were excellent but the risotto and cheesecake were the best we’ve ever had. Quantities were more than enough for the 2 of us.

We loved it so much we went twice; on our first and last nights in Spain. The tapas were creative and inventive. They were filling without being overwhelming or breaking the bank. Coming from Gran Vía it was a little difficult to find at first. They were gracious when we were a little late and honored our reservation anyway. The staff was friendly, helpful, accommodating.   In terms of drinks, on our first visit we ordered a pitcher of the red sangria (basically juice) which I ordered because everyone else seemed to be drinking it. We did not catch a buzz but this seems to be the case most times we ordered Sangria in Spain. Then towards the end of the meal my sister had an egg white cocktail with lavender in it, in a clear glass that sat on top of crushed up brownies. It was amazing because the drink was delicious and the brownie bites were the perfect sweet way to end the meal.   To eat, we had the special which was squid stuffed with duck meat, the beet gazpacho (which was thick and tasty) and the ribs.  On our last night in Madrid we couldn’t get into their sister restaurant, Rosa Di La Loca, so we came back. Since they couldn’t seat us on time, they gave us complimentary beer before and throughout our meal. We ordered the hummus and tuna tataki. The tuna tataki was fresh and had as many pieces as a main course. It came in a boat with steam coming out of it like a cloud. The hummus was delicious and was a bright green St. Patrick’s day color, the coolest hummus I’d ever seen and it was delicious as well.  The ambiance is minimal but chic. Wood panels line the restaurant. The art is funky too and cohesive around the restaurant and on the menu. The bathroom is ""co ed"" but two stalls. The dark floral wallpaper is moody and looks very cool in pictures. They have hanging plants in the bathroom as well, the perfect place to take a mirror selfie.  I would 100% recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a cool, trendy, yummy place to eat in Madrid!

Start of we were drawn in by the huge sangria glass for less than 5 euros. It was filled with fruits and generous portion. I also had an old fashion that was very strong but wasn’t straight whiskey.  The tartar was loaded with avocado and salmon. The salmon missed a little bit of flavor but none the less delicious. The squid salad is a must have. The squid is cooked perfectly with garlic and the sauce on the side was the perfect combination. Highly recommend! The Paella although my girlfriend said she thought it was very good, I thought it was a little bland. Everyone around us ordered their own paella so it must be worth to at least try. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The decor had a bit of an indie vibe with posters and pictures. The clientele ranged from college students drinking on a night out to women celebrating 40th birthday. Definitely a lively atmosphere. They also gave us a complimentary birthday cake which was absolutely rich chocolate. So delicious.

My husband’s enthusiasm was sparked by Zenith’s signature Eggs Zenith, which consists of sourdough toast, avocado, chives, hollandaise sauce, jamón ( he subbed ham) and, the real showstopper - poached breaded eggs.  How does one even go about breading poached eggs?!? It must be magic! (I can barely fry an egg without sealing havoc on my hubby’s most beloved meal).

Now, I’m not sure if they changed their algorithm or I just followed advice of a hundred people who have no idea what good food is. Those of you who read my reviews knows that I rarely give poor ratings or write bad reviews. When I look for a place, I look for the best. I also compare apples with apples. There are 5 Star fast food places and I would never give them 2 stars because they were fast food. No, this place has very mediocre food and very basic service (yes, they DO speak English). The only good thing about this place was it’s very unusual yet very tasty sangria. Shakshuka was just okay and Zenith signature egg dish was .... interesting.... the jamon that came with whatever that was had a quality of a dried out beef in the chefs unsuccessful attempted turn it into a crispy bacon. Espresso was bad. It has ambiance of Starbucks or, and I’m being generous here, Cafe Nero in Fort Point channel in Boston... In short, with over 10 restaurants in Madrid, this one is not near the top. Several places I simply walked in from the street (none of them was Starbucks or MacDonald’s) where at the very least 100 times better.  Hopefully this ratings are joke of hungry American students giving five star reviews in exchange for food. And that’s better than an alternative: my neighbor’s company dropping the ball....",2019-05-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d17340009-Reviews-or260-Zenith_Brunch_Cocktails-Madrid.html,UID_15762,0.053,0.81,0.137,0.9737,0.0971428571428571,0.5200666099773242,0.4726428571428571,1407,116,0.0824449182658138,0,42,False,45,0.0967741935483871,0.1451612903225806,0.2419354838709677,0.032258064516129,0.2419354838709677,0.032258064516129,0.032258064516129,0.032258064516129,0.0967741935483871,0.0483870967741935,255,178,4.517647058823529,0,0,visit place morn use trust tripadvisor rate sure chang algorithm follow advic hundr peopl idea good food read review know rare give poor rate write bad review look place look best also compar appl appl star fast food place would never give star fast food place mediocr food basic servic ye speak english good thing place unusu yet tasti sangria shakshuka okay zenith signatur egg dish interest jamon came whatev qualiti dri beef chef unsuccess attempt turn crispi bacon espresso bad ambianc starbuck gener cafe nero fort point channel boston short restaur madrid one near top sever place simpli walk street none starbuck macdonald least time better hope rate joke hungri american student give five star review exchang food better altern neighbor compani drop ball,average review,3

In the end more have nots. Ordered food. My wife had the burrata cheese and I ordered the gazpacho soup . The cheese came along with 2 gazpacho soup . So far great ,but wine was warm and we were advised not to drink for 10 mins. Excellent this far. Then we ordered grilled veal and chicken. Veal , was medium rare as requested but was tough and we ate half of it . The chicken was raw . The waiter seemed shocked when I cut into it and showed him. Would be replaced at no charge.

We waited awkwardly for someone to finally ‘notice’ us. Anyways afterwards we end up waiting more than 1h to even receive our orders bc of a problem in the system ?! We have to ask about what happened to even get an answer. It was frustrating to see everyone that arrived afterwards to be served and all. When we finally get our dishes, the server’s attitude is just horrible, he looks like he doesn’t want to be here. We then see people from the kitchen or servers eat on tables meant for clients. I don’t know feels like this place is just for your instagram but when it comes to taste it’s just average. The pancakes were not very tasty honestly, it was written no where in the menu that the pancake itself had bananas so that was unpleasant to discover. The tapioca was dry, the drinks come without straw so the sugar ends up staying at the bottom.

Same design of the menu, website, staff uniforms as the mentioned pizza place, but the outcome a bit different. Theres a couple of starters such as wings, mozzarella sticks (which are quite nice with their sweet tomato salsa), then selection of burgers (where you can select a size from tiny to a monster big) and then selection of grilled meats with steaks and ribs. The wine/ drink menu points again to the same restaurant group and offers very good wines for very friendly prices. The design of the places is quite well done, again as in the Ôven the toilets are quite impressive with the open sink (not so practical taps but heyy, looks very cool). Seats are comfy and tables big enough to hold your food, however a bit squeezed together. Open bar and open kitchen gives you more to look at as well. The food itself (mozarella sticks already mentioned) is ok at its best.  Our both steaks were more on a chewy side and not much rested so got quite bloodied plates). Unfortunately no peppercorn or bearnaise sauce to go with your meat. Dessert menu is simple and offering good cookie from the oven with ice cream, coffee very tasty.

Located in a bustling area of busy bars and cafes, the exterior resembles a whimsical book shop from Harry Potter, Mary Poppins or Portabello Road, with books lined up and stacked around the entryway. Although it was already full with a queue forming, the hostess was able to seat us immediately in the back room overlooking a psychedelic garden. Julie (who bears a striking resemblance to Scarlett Johansson) and Richard took excellent care of us, with professional and enthusiastic service. We accepted her recommendation to try the “special of the week), “sepas.” I’m still not certain what it was, but it had mushrooms and diced potatoes, shrouded in sauce, served piping hot in a cast iron skillet and dotted with crisp veggie chips. Between that and the Tuna Tataki (DELISH), we didn’t have room to finish the chicken! Accompanied by 2 copas of white wine (mine), and 3 copas of red (his), we were surprised to find the entire bill came to only 38 euros! OK, the wine glasses were small, but it’s just as well.

It is on a very very well lit street, much brighter than many streets I have been in Madrid. Arriving at 8.30pm,restaurant was half filled. The menu has many dishes that do half portions which was ideal to try a few things. Ordered prawns with garlic and grilled veg with goat cheese. Prawns came in sizzling oil with garlic and chillies. I have had prawns in much stronger garlic and seems that Spanish prawns are quite gritty even though intestines been removed. The grilled veg had aubergines, onions, sweet potato, green pepper, tomatoes and croguettes and the goat cheese was soooooooo good. It would be better if they put red pepper for some sweetness in the dish.

As recommended by other reviewers we ordered 4 half portions for the two of us.  The Garlic prawns had a amazing flavour and a pillowy texture. The cod with goats cheese and honey, served on a bed of potato was a delight. Grilled veg with goats cheese was a relief to finally eat some vegetables. The pulled steak cuban style was a kind of saucy curry, sweet and sour affair served with home made potato crisps. For dessert we shared milk cake. We were not sure what to expect. It was a sponge cake soaked in condensed milk, lovely. We were served by the very charming Carla, whose English was excellent. In fact everyone there was friendly and spoke English.

It was totally worth it! It looks like a typical Spanish taberna/tapas bar. The menu offers a few tapas but also a lot of various dishes such as Latin ones (more Latin dishes than tapas). The main dishes can also be ordered as 1/2 portions if you want to try different dishes.  We have choosen several different dishes and shared them. I can totally recommend all of them! My favorite was the grilles squid with salad! (See pictures). The sangria was strong but very tasty. My boyfriend had ""Alhambra"" beer and really liked it. Tastes similar to Yuengling (the American beer, for those who are familiar with it). All in all we had a great evening with great food and very good service!

The menu was a little daunting at that time of day so we asked the excellent Oscar (from Ecuador) to sort us out with what he recommends. Every course was delicious, well presented and served in good time. And he in no way took advantage, the amount of food for us all was spot on. The thought of dealing with a fairly rowdy bunch may have daunted some, but Oscar was brilliant from start to finish. I even got a birthday cake!!

After some search we chose Más al Sur. We like to split our meals and they have an option for a half portion which is perfect for us cause we like to mix and match. We had a portobello mushrooms risotto which wasn't really a risotto if you ask me but was very tasty. I mean it was creamy yes but it wasn't from the rice but the mushroom sauce which was a bit too thick and the rice wasn't Al dente. We had a cesar's salad and again the sauce was a bit too strong for my liking. The curry chicken was great. And so was the lemon cake, very creamy and just enough tang. We got a complementary shots as we were leaving which made us stay for another drink. We went for cocktails and since I'm a big cocktail fan the cocktail master fixed me up with one of his recipes. And then another one so I tell him my opinion. We only got charged for one even though we had 3 cocktails. It's has great atmosphere, priced are acceptable and the waiters know their job.

Before I get to the ropa, let me flash back to the beginning. based upon the review about the ropa, my wife and I decided to try this place. we arrived and there were a lot of people already inside. all seemingly drinking and in high spirits. we walk in and were greeted warmly and taken to a table of two. the staff was great, polite and attentive. I loved them all. we ordered a bottle of wine which was delicious. no one rushed us. everything was great. my wife ordered what she thought was the Mediterranean salad, but maybe got confused and asked for the same salad the patron at the next table ordered. that salad looked fantastic. it turns out that the salad at the next table was not the Mediterranean salad, but the salad that had salmon. ok, it was still delicious. we also had the quiche with mushrooms. the flavor was very good, but I thought it was cold in the middle. the ends of the square piece of quiche that we got were warm or room temperature but the middle was decidedly cold, but who cares? we're on vacation, we have a bottle of wine to finish off. the vibe in the restaurant was hip and happening. all good. we order the ropa vieja and the risotto.  they brought out the ropa first. omg. the ropa was served on a plate with no rice, just chips, yes, freshly fried potato chips where some of the chips got stuck together and when you separate them, the part that stuck together is translucent...you know what I am talking about. thankfully, we ordered the risotto to go with the ropa. the risotto came out and it was inedible. I can only liken it to spackle. the consistency as unbelievable. I took a spoonful and turned it over and asked my wife how long she thought it would take to fall off the spoon. it took twelve seconds. the ropa, was brown and runny. the taste wasn't horrible, but the presentation was really sorry. after finishing our wine, we asked for the bill and paid and on our way out, the manager (I guess) shouted out not to leave, they wanted to give us a complimentary after dinner drink, which was soooo nice. (they had no idea we didn't like the food, we hadn't said anything.) like I said, I loved the staff, but the best food in madrid. errrr, there is a better place two doors down.  the fact that we found this other place while walking to taberna, made the evening worthwhile.",2015-12-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396325-Reviews-or1500-Taberna_Mas_Al_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_15895,0.042,0.808,0.15,0.996,0.2641959064327485,0.587953216374269,0.4030189189189189,2487,235,0.0944913550462404,0,77,False,101,0.1290322580645161,0.1612903225806451,0.2419354838709677,0.0967741935483871,0.1612903225806451,0.0161290322580645,0.0161290322580645,0.0161290322580645,0.1290322580645161,0.032258064516129,465,251,4.346236559139785,0,0,one trip advisor wrote ropa vieja best food madrid must drink four five gallon wine get ropa let flash back begin base upon review ropa wife decid tri place arriv lot peopl alreadi insid seemingli drink high spirit walk greet warmli taken tabl two staff great polit attent love order bottl wine delici one rush us everyth great wife order thought mediterranean salad mayb got confus ask salad patron next tabl order salad look fantast turn salad next tabl mediterranean salad salad salmon ok still delici also quich mushroom flavor good thought cold middl end squar piec quich got warm room temperatur middl decidedli cold care vacat bottl wine finish vibe restaur hip happen good order ropa vieja risotto brought ropa first omg ropa serv plate rice chip ye freshli fri potato chip chip got stuck togeth separ part stuck togeth transluc know talk thank order risotto go ropa risotto came ined liken spackl consist unbeliev took spoon turn ask wife long thought would take fall spoon took twelv second ropa brown runni tast horribl present realli sorri finish wine ask bill paid way manag guess shout leav want give us complimentari dinner drink soooo nice idea like food said anyth like said love staff best food madrid errrr better place two door fact found place walk taberna made even worthwhil,very good review,5

The menu is reduced but very appealing with classic tapas selection but with a modern touch. The wine menu is also quite different to the average place, I´d advise to ask the waiter for recommendation based on your taste. We went there with a vegetarian friend and for the first time in Spain she had a good selection of dishes to order. We went for the burrata, gazpacho, bravas, ceviche, pao and tortilla (probably the only disappointing dish even though it was recommended by the waiter).

Every dish at every restaurant we ate at in Madrid and Toledo had fantastic food.  However, I would rate this as the most ""fun"". This was where we first had a taste of smoked octopus (see pic). It was served with mashed potato and a delicious sauce. As you will see from the photo, for people like us who had never eaten octopus, it was served quite spectacularly as a tentacle! With suckers... But it certainly lived up to its reviews! Wonderful flavour. We liked it so much, we had it again and again at other restaurants. This is also the only place where we had a ooo-aaahhh moment. Our order of hanging bacon or prosciutto arrived and was crisped up with a flaming torch (see photo) and served with green bread and pear puree. Also the only place where ""Bao"" was served.

And what a recommendation it was. The restaurant itself is trendy with a really chill, laid back vibe. They’re not afraid to experiment with their food, offering up their own take in traditional Spanish dishes. There was plenty of variety with lots of lovely meat dishes as well as really tasty salads too. The portions are really reasonably sized for the price you’re paying, most dishes were around €7-€9 (although I did think €11 for a salad was a little steep). Their cocktail menu is just as varied as their food menu again adding welcome changes to traditional cocktails such as mojitos. Service was quick, efficient and pleasant. It’s fairly centrally located with plenty of bars and clubs to choose from afterwards. I really enjoyed my meal here and was surprised my just how much I enjoyed the flavour combinations that they paired together.

They say you only review restaurants that you do not enjoy, and this is no exception. The Good: Server was friendly. Beer was cold. Wine was exceptional. The dishes were well presented. The Bad: Along with some appetizers, we ordered the Paella Negra (black seafood paella with squid ink), which was the main reason we came here. We had had similar dishes elsewhere here in Madrid, and due to the hype of this place, we were excited to try it here. Boy were we disappointed. To say the dish was salty would be an understatement. You may argue that a seafood paella should taste like the ocean, however, as someone who tastes the ocean on a regular basis (I am an open water swimmer), this tasted like if you took the ocean, boiled off all the water, and then added salt. As I write this, my tongue is still burning, and I am slightly worried I may have injured my kidneys and had borderline heart failure. After taking two bites each, we sent it back to the kitchen. They apologized profusely, and promised to remake the dish with less salt. We debated if we should give them another chance, and decided it was worth a shot. The second dish they served us tasted like they had ran the original dish under some water, then added more salt. While we have no proof, we are fairly certain they tried to salvage at least some of the muscles/shrimp, as there was no noticeable reduction of salt on those items. To be fair, they checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying the second round. We regrettably informed them that no, it was still way too salty. Unfortunately, even after we expressed our distaste of their second attempt, they still charged us full price (we ate maybe 1/4 of if). Final Thoughts: If you are looking for a place to drink cold beer, delicious wine, and are a huge fan of salty food, this is the place for you. However, if you are looking for a good paella, move along…",2019-04-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10358028-Reviews-or340-Inclan_Brutal_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_15977,0.079,0.777,0.144,0.9755,0.09465737514518,0.533631883022127,0.6676190476190476,1956,178,0.091002044989775,0,60,False,71,0.1095890410958904,0.1232876712328767,0.2191780821917808,0.0684931506849315,0.1232876712328767,0.0410958904109589,0.0410958904109589,0.0410958904109589,0.1506849315068493,0.0821917808219178,363,221,4.3911845730027546,0,0,first review honestli hope last say review restaur enjoy except good server friendli beer cold wine except dish well present bad along appet order paella negra black seafood paella squid ink main reason came similar dish elsewher madrid due hype place excit tri boy disappoint say dish salti would understat may argu seafood paella tast like ocean howev someon tast ocean regular basi open water swimmer tast like took ocean boil water ad salt write tongu still burn slightli worri may injur kidney borderlin heart failur take two bite sent back kitchen apolog profus promis remak dish less salt debat give anoth chanc decid worth shot second dish serv us tast like ran origin dish water ad salt proof fairli certain tri salvag least muscl shrimp notic reduct salt item fair check us make sure enjoy second round regrett inform still way salti unfortun even express distast second attempt still charg us full price ate mayb final thought look place drink cold beer delici wine huge fan salti food place howev look good paella move along,average review,3

We booked online however decided that 8PM was a little early so stopped by on Saturday morning to change our booking which was not a problem. The pictures online had put me off slightly however once I saw it for myself, I need not have worried. We arrived at about 845 and already it was very busy, unfortunately there was a hen party who got there at the same time and were very loud. We were seated next to them and upon seeing my face our charming and attentive waitress asked would we like a table near the front. This attention to detail was excellent as a table sat next to a hen party would have ruined our evening. The menu whilst fairly small seemed incredibly cheap, wine priced from 9 - 13 euro which I thought was a glass but was actually the bottle. Our waitress explained how the menu worked and we chose a number of dishes. It is Tapas but with a difference, we had the chicken, veal and tuna all which were to die for. The Albarino wine one of the best I have had. The service was super efficient and the place had a fab atmosphere. We travel a lot and eat out frequently, Brutal it is not!! Astonishing yes, and a bill of €35 unreal in a capital city.

We had genuine hugs, encouragement, smiles and even a few pinches on the cheek throughout the night. It's a cozy, intimate restaurant with few tables so make a reservation.

I knew from those reviews that the restaurant offered only a tasting menu (with some choices to suit your preferences), that the dishes were traditional (in some cases, based on historical reconstructions by the proprietess's uncle, Joaquín Racionero, a restaurateur, cookbook author, and poet), that the food was delicious, and that the owner was warm and charming. Well, it was all that and more. Normally, Milagros and Enrique operate by reservations. They nevertheless took me in on the late side of the afternoon, after I'd wandered past the door (the restaurant is on a tiny sidestreet and it looks boarded up or private: you have to use the traditional metal knocker to find out if anyone is ""at home""). Since it was a slow afternoon and because they're immensely hospitable, they welcomed me wholeheartedly. The interior looks like a timeless ""casa de comidas"" in La Mancha (with its rustic feel, elevated by the beautiful tilework lining its lower half--from Talavera de la Reina?). The walls are plastered with clippings about MIlagros's polymath uncle, reviews of the counter-cultural effect of his reintroducing traditional Manchegan food to Spain's post-Franco early 80s, pictures of famous customers (they draw a distinguished clientele, despite the apparent simplicity of the decor and the very attractive prices), and even some very good art inspired by the warm welcome. Enrique and Milagros took turns serving dishes from the tasting menu, explaining each one with relish and solicitious care. I expected flavorful, but somewhat heavy dishes: nothing of the kind. Even the initial manchegan chorizo was smooth and light, as were the shepherd gazpacho (nothing to do with Andalusian gazpacho: a thin hash of hare, hen, quail, and pheasant) and the manchegan gazpacho (a Sephardic dish, with slices of unleavened bread that felt and tasted like pasta in a lovely, brothier version of the shepherd gazpacho). Next came a possible precursor to French pate (the meatier morteruelo, served warm with little square slices of toast), followed by yet another dish I'd never sampled (atascaburras)--a kind of puree of cod and potatoes, garnished with boiled egg and walnuts (which gave a satisfying crunch). I don't much like cod as a rule but really took to this combo. Milagros then offered a range of choices for the main course: I picked the quail in chocolate sauce, Milagros's own divine invention. We concluded with a sampler of desserts, all of Sephardic or Islamic inspiration: mostillo (grape juice/must, cinammon, nuts), alajú (think a softer, more flavorful turrón), arrope (candied pumpkin in a burnt honey sauce), and a heavenly slice of lightly fried eggplant drizzled with honey (I don't like eggplant but loved this). One dish more satisfying than the next (the mostillo pairs nicely with the cheese slices they offer). Even the open-pot coffee and the liqueur (a very mild, slightly coffee-flavored Cuencan home brew called resolí) were excellent. All served up with humor, with, warmth, tremendous vitality, and absolute integrity. The tasting menu is absolutely essential for this kind of food: well-sourced, highly elaborate, requiring many hours to cook properly and achieve the ideal lightness and complexity. They price this labor of love to attract repeat visits. They're so honorable, they tried to give me the 30% discount from El Tenedor that the other customers in the restaurant had arranged for on-line. I made up for their very Spanish gesture with the tip: this kind of integrity deserves support. I am left with the memory of Milagros pointing out a painting and note by a customer from Huelva (an artist named Rafa Pinto, with shows in Madrid), who chose to commemorate his visit, and celebrate their warmth and charm, with a striking work of art. A very special place, led by two vital, creative persons.",2015-11-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697567-Reviews-or10-El_Tormo-Madrid.html,UID_2056,0.018,0.801,0.181,0.999,0.2933584842387659,0.6115895372233399,0.3884695652173913,3968,261,0.0657762096774193,0,143,False,84,0.0758620689655172,0.1862068965517241,0.3586206896551724,0.0482758620689655,0.1724137931034483,0.0137931034482758,0.0206896551724137,0.0206896551724137,0.0620689655172413,0.0413793103448275,646,397,5.143962848297214,0,0,put list restaur check madrid see rave review spanish el tenedor site knew review restaur offer tast menu choic suit prefer dish tradit case base histor reconstruct proprietess uncl joaqu n racionero restaurateur cookbook author poet food delici owner warm charm well normal milagro enriqu oper reserv nevertheless took late side afternoon wander past door restaur tini sidestreet look board privat use tradit metal knocker find anyon home sinc slow afternoon immens hospit welcom wholeheartedli interior look like timeless casa de comida la mancha rustic feel elev beauti tilework line lower half talavera de la reina wall plaster clip milagro polymath uncl review counter cultur effect reintroduc tradit manchegan food spain post franco earli pictur famou custom draw distinguish clientel despit appar simplic decor attract price even good art inspir warm welcom enriqu milagro took turn serv dish tast menu explain one relish soliciti care expect flavor somewhat heavi dish noth kind even initi manchegan chorizo smooth light shepherd gazpacho noth andalusian gazpacho thin hash hare hen quail pheasant manchegan gazpacho sephard dish slice unleaven bread felt tast like pasta love brothier version shepherd gazpacho next came possibl precursor french pate meatier morteruelo serv warm littl squar slice toast follow yet anoth dish never sampl atascaburra kind pure cod potato garnish boil egg walnut gave satisfi crunch much like cod rule realli took combo milagro offer rang choic main cours pick quail chocol sauc milagro divin invent conclud sampler dessert sephard islam inspir mostillo grape juic must cinammon nut alaj think softer flavor turr n arrop candi pumpkin burnt honey sauc heavenli slice lightli fri eggplant drizzl honey like eggplant love one dish satisfi next mostillo pair nice chees slice offer even open pot coffe liqueur mild slightli coffe flavor cuencan home brew call resol excel serv humor warmth tremend vital absolut integr tast menu absolut essenti kind food well sourc highli elabor requir mani hour cook properli achiev ideal light complex price labor love attract repeat visit honor tri give discount el tenedor custom restaur arrang line made spanish gestur tip kind integr deserv support left memori milagro point paint note custom huelva artist name rafa pinto show madrid chose commemor visit celebr warmth charm strike work art special place led two vital creativ person,very good review,5

The waitress was rude and did not handle the situation in a professional manner at all. She attempted to blame us for taking too long to order when in reality we had been waiting patiently for our order to be taken. We all then waited a further 30 minutes staring at 6 bowls of potatoes because they don't bring the food out altogether. Furthermore (and this is some free advice for management), it is standard practice in any restaurant to, at the very least, give diners forewarning and an indication of how much time they have left before bullying them to leave the table. We were stunned by how we were treated. Needless to say, we will not be returning.

We were searching for a burger establishment that had the best of both worlds; an A1A steakhouse meets rich Spanish culture. So at last we found a hidden gem in a realm full of rhinestones. We were pleasantly amazed with the inviting entrance of the exterior [10/10]. The interior was well collected, clean & gloriously organized [10/10]. In addition, the hostess extended a warm welcome and instantly found us a readily available table [10/10]. The server was proactively attentive and recommend us some A1A dishes [10/10]. No doubt, it was a little packed for dinner, but managed to fulfill amazing service [10/10]. On the other hand, I ordered my steak a certain way, and ended liking it even better than I originally expected it [20/10].

As italian I can almost get all the food in spanish but for the family of my wife it was difficult. Luckily we had Jordan, a great waiter, Jordan, who was really helful with all. I said about my allergy with garlic and onion and they manage to cook for me a real paella without these two ingredients. I know, it is almost blasphemy to take off these ingredients from most of the dishes but what can you do if you're allergic?

I was popping buy after advise from Trip Advisor and was greeted by very friendly and service oriented staff that in perfect English advised me a good menu without over selling the dishes. I had the croquettes with Iberian ham served with small chips made from root vegetables a very delicious dish whit a fine note of mushrooms. Main dish was the Steak Tenderloin - very nice pice of meat perfectly grilled and with a really tasty Gorgonzola sauce. The potatoes under the meet was cold but the taste was okay and the bread was average.

It’s located in the center of Madrid, next to the shopping-street Gran Vía. After a nice day of shopping, you can easily walk to the restaurant and enjoy a nice meal.  Inside, you get the feeling that you’re inside an American restaurant. It’s quite dark but it gave me a very cozy feeling. The furniture is a beautiful combination of vintage leather chairs and very modern black steel cupboards. I found it very comfortable that there is a lot of space between the tables. That way, you don’t have the feeling that you’re in a crowdy restaurant.  Two weeks ago, I ordered the crispy chickenburger with a delicious layer of cheese and fries. The fries weren’t deep-fried but they were baked in the oven which made them very crispy. I absolutely adored the fries! The chickenburger was served on a big plate. The chicken was fried and the bread was slightly toasted. It was very savoury. Another good thing about this burger is that it wasn’t overfilled. That way I could eat it without spilling too much.  The service in this restaurant was absolutely amazing. I came in and the waiters immediately greeted me. I ordered my food and I got it after 10-15 minutes. The staff was very friendly. When I left the restaurant, they asked me if I was happy with the service they gave me. They saw that I was a tourist and we made a chat about my time in Madrid. I have nothing to complain about concerning this restaurant.",2019-05-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12581722-Reviews-or240-Steakburger_Gran_Via-Madrid.html,UID_16225,0.0,0.812,0.188,0.9954,0.2318154761904762,0.542797619047619,0.388640909090909,1495,135,0.0903010033444816,1,32,False,58,0.1282051282051282,0.1538461538461538,0.2051282051282051,0.0641025641025641,0.1538461538461538,0.0512820512820512,0.0384615384615384,0.0512820512820512,0.0769230769230769,0.0769230769230769,269,158,4.550185873605948,0,0,steakburg gran v place like typic american burger locat center madrid next shop street gran v nice day shop easili walk restaur enjoy nice meal insid get feel insid american restaur quit dark gave cozi feel furnitur beauti combin vintag leather chair modern black steel cupboard found comfort lot space tabl way feel crowdi restaur two week ago order crispi chickenburg delici layer chees fri fri deep fri bake oven made crispi absolut ador fri chickenburg serv big plate chicken fri bread slightli toast savouri anoth good thing burger overfil way could eat without spill much servic restaur absolut amaz came waiter immedi greet order food got minut staff friendli left restaur ask happi servic gave saw tourist made chat time madrid noth complain concern restaur,very good review,5

After glancing at the menu, we knew what we were going to order. We got the Cuban shredded beef, a seafood paella, chicken curry, a pan fried eggplant, and a salad. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. The sangria arrived first and it was by far our favorite sangria of the trip; and we literally drank at least 2 a day. We ordered another one for the table in the middle of the meal because it was so delicious. The salad arrived shortly after the first pitcher of sangria and it was alright. I mean, it's a salad. We made 2 separate ""portions"" as our table was a bit smaller for 5 people and the shredded beef and eggplant came out in the first batch. The amount of tenderness and moist complemented the crisp that the potato chips offered and it was my personal favorite for the meal and I wish it came out last, but it was definitely an appetizer type dish for everyone to share. The pan fried eggplants were seasoned perfectly and were a little crisp on the outside and tasteful on the inside. The paella and chicken curry arrived second. If you love seafood, this one is probably for you. You can probably get away with ordering two of these for the table because the size is smaller compared to the other paellas we ate around Madrid. It was very flavorful nonetheless and it came with a giant prawn, a few shrimp, clams, a squid, and calamari, and a squid. Peter, our waiter was very friendly and attentive the whole meal. He made casual conversation with us even gave us a few free treats like lemon liquor and a cheesecake. He was really fun and a delight to have. Definitely a recommend here, even if you come just for a drink and a snack.",2019-10-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396325-Reviews-or190-Taberna_Mas_Al_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_16240,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.9962,0.1069078947368421,0.5152412280701754,0.3161166666666666,1765,163,0.0923512747875354,0,38,False,79,0.1153846153846153,0.1923076923076923,0.2692307692307692,0.0192307692307692,0.173076923076923,0.0192307692307692,0.0192307692307692,0.0576923076923076,0.1153846153846153,0.0192307692307692,330,182,4.351515151515152,0,0,seat hostess peter greet us tabl immedi start order glanc menu knew go order got cuban shred beef seafood paella chicken curri pan fri eggplant salad also order pitcher sangria tabl sangria arriv first far favorit sangria trip liter drank least day order anoth one tabl middl meal delici salad arriv shortli first pitcher sangria alright mean salad made separ portion tabl bit smaller peopl shred beef eggplant came first batch amount tender moist complement crisp potato chip offer person favorit meal wish came last definit appet type dish everyon share pan fri eggplant season perfectli littl crisp outsid tast insid paella chicken curri arriv second love seafood one probabl probabl get away order two tabl size smaller compar paella ate around madrid flavor nonetheless came giant prawn shrimp clam squid calamari squid peter waiter friendli attent whole meal made casual convers us even gave us free treat like lemon liquor cheesecak realli fun delight definit recommend even come drink snack,very good review,5

It's a small, cozy cafe with excellent service and food.  Delicious bread was served first. Then the mains arrived! My daughter raved about the ravioli which she said was truly delectable. She wished the serving were larger! I had the paella de marisco which was moist and tasty. And hubby had the excellent and tender solomillo with a cheese sauce. A jug of generous fruit-infused sangria rounded out the meal.  Our handsome waiter, Matias, couldn't have been more attentive, solicitous, helpful or pleasant.

We rested in our hotel room after a long flight from California, U.S.A. This burger joint is not too far away from our hotel, and we were not yet ready to pick a restaurant that serves Spanish foods. We chose convenience over anything else and we crossed our fingers. Restaurant staff are helpful and courteous, these young people tried their best to explain their burgers in English for us so that we could order the kind of burgers we wanted. My wife and I chose the oxmeat because we never had this meat before, and we were not disappointed.  Table service was pretty good. The oxmeat was quite thick and was cooked as ordered. Meats and French fries potatoes were both delicious. I ordered a Spanish brand of beer and it was very good! It hit the right spot after a long international flight and on a warm evening in Madrid. The burgers were thick and big we could not finish them, so we brown bagged the other half of our respective burgers. There was one minor problem though but it was quickly rectified by the restaurant staff. There are two sizes for their beers, a medium size and a large size. I asked the waiter how big the large size was, long story short, they brought me BOTH the medium as well as the large glass of beer even though I told the waiter I wanted the medium size of beer. I am sure it was the language problem that led to this problem because my Spanish is worse than their English. As I previously mentioned, this was quickly rectified by the restaurant’s staff. Side note, I ended up picking the Large glass of their beer!",2018-09-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12581722-Reviews-or340-Steakburger_Gran_Via-Madrid.html,UID_16277,0.048,0.873,0.079,0.6206,0.1649943310657596,0.4244576719576719,0.4158588235294117,1603,144,0.0898315658140985,2,30,False,71,0.1269841269841269,0.1746031746031746,0.238095238095238,0.0476190476190476,0.0952380952380952,0.0317460317460317,0.0158730158730158,0.0634920634920634,0.1111111111111111,0.0952380952380952,296,173,4.41554054054054,0,0,arriv hotel madrid late afternoon rest hotel room long flight california u burger joint far away hotel yet readi pick restaur serv spanish food chose conveni anyth els cross finger restaur staff help courteou young peopl tri best explain burger english us could order kind burger want wife chose oxmeat never meat disappoint tabl servic pretti good oxmeat quit thick cook order meat french fri potato delici order spanish brand beer good hit right spot long intern flight warm even madrid burger thick big could finish brown bag half respect burger one minor problem though quickli rectifi restaur staff two size beer medium size larg size ask waiter big larg size long stori short brought medium well larg glass beer even though told waiter want medium size beer sure languag problem led problem spanish wors english previous mention quickli rectifi restaur staff side note end pick larg glass beer,good review,4
