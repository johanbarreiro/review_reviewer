So we walked over to Juana la Loca. WOW is the food there ever holding up! The chefs work in the ""new"" tapas style (not so new anymore, but still scrumptious), influenced by Spain's culinary revolution of the late 90s. We shared a generous ración of squid ink fideos with a wonderful onion-calamari marmelade (out of this world), a plate of cantabrian anchovies that were enormous, and dense and rich (again, fabulous), and a bottle of 2008 Emilio Moro Ribera del Duero that kept the conversation running late into the night. As always, the service was friendly and helpful. A new touch I liked: one or two people in there, eating on their own. That's still sort of hard to find in this town. So add Juana la Loca to the list of places that work for one (if you're hungry: the place is primarily raciones, not small tapas). Important note: Juana la Loca is CASH ONLY! The atms nearby seem safe to use, despite the rowdy, usually very drunken, juerga that gets going in the plaza in the evenings. Do practice the usual cautions against pickpockets.

I won't describe in detail the various tasting plates: starting plates: fish dish; meat dish and two desserts, but suffice it to say they were all fabulous and some of them were genuinely extraordinary. I know extraordinary is a much abused phrase , but some of the dishes, particularly the final dessert can only be described that way. The wine list was very comprehensive, with quality wines from around the globe. We chose Spanish, and our choice of White (Albarinho ) and red ( a Gran reserve Rioja ) were outstanding and great value for money at about 35 Euro per bottle. There were of course cheaper wines and more expensive, but I was delighted with the quality of the wine at the price. The sommelier was great. young, knowledgable , and more about suggesting interesting wines , rather than expensive wines. We concluded our dinner with a red dessert wine, which for me was a first. Gorgeous wine and very inexpensive. The waitress was lovely, professional and a delight. As a dining experience you have to try this restaurant.

Due to the popularity of the place, we went early, around 8pm, and we were able to get a table right away. We wanted to try a different number of tapas and ended ordering patatas bravas, quiche, salmorejo, El Sur salad, the Cesar salad and the Vieja Ropa - all half portions. The food came as it was ready and it was ridiculously good. Just one warning: The portion sizes are massive!! We were so surprised but enjoyed every bite we were able to get from our self made buffet! To me, Taberna el Sur provides the real, authentic Spanish tapas experience and I would recommend every (hungry) person I know :-) The menu has a wide selection from regular tapas to the more original plates that give that 'little extra something'.

Take a good look at the menu because it was edible. It was made of potato and was served with a mayonnaise peanut oil. My thought went once you eat the menu with the prices you will forget how much lunch was. Now that I am writing this review and have finished lunch it was the biggest bargain. I want to come back tomorrow. With the sommelier's help I selected different wines by the glass. They are pictured here. The first course was Game Truffle with Duck Foie Gras and mushrooms. The game was Pigeon. It was served under a dome enclosing eucalyptus smoke. I have never had foie gras like this before. It tasted like it was blended so smooth that it melted in your mouth. Sometimes game birds can be gamey, not this. It was mild and delicious. "" ""Incredible"" The butter served with the bread was "" Real"" and wonderful. The next was the Caviar Leaf. I hope picture does it justice. This was an etherial way to present and serve this. The leaf was actually black Caviar. It was accompanied by onion, cauliflower, light cream and potato. It is Caviar in another format, it really was shaped like a leaf with veins and short stem. The cream slightly softened the saltiness of the Caviar. It was Brilliant!!!!! Next was a ""Shot"" of Butter Fish with White Asparagus, seaweed Ikora with foam on top. There was a perfect balance of flavours that went on in the mouth like a great wine. Next came Celeriac cream with smoked Sardine and Apple. Also accompanied by Black Caviar and the Gold Caviar was actually made from oil not fish eggs. All the flavours worked together without any one of them overwhelming another. Even the smoked Sardine was mild. My wife was served an Onion soup over brie cheese toast. She said she loved it. I include pictures of the stages of the serving of this soup. My course was ""Verdinas"" beans with Cockles and Sea Urchin foam. The Cockles tasted like they just came out of the ocean. These beans are from Northern Spain. These have to be the Best I have ever had. The base of this dish was like a soup of bean pure blended with sea urchin. The fantastic quality of the ingredients was so spectacular. The Chef Mery Marte Rosario let each ingredient speak for itself, nothing getting in the way way of anything else. Egg with bread and Pancetta served over a light potato cream sauce. I cut through the egg and it flowed out like you would expect a soft boiled egg to do. The Pancetta was so mild it almost tasted like a mild salmon. In a very pleasant positive way. Each dish shows how this chef takes combinations of flavours to the ""Next"" level- Way beyond! The quality of the ingredients is so apparent that you can only imagine what the chef must go through to find these amazing ingredients. Red Mullet on Saffron Bullion was accompanied by artichoke, shallots and coconut foam. The shallots were so delicious and they helped bring all the dish together. Suckling Lamb Shoulder with Tandoori crumble was beyond description. The brown sauce was made from the bones of the lamb. The white sauce using a yogurt. The crumble was fine and from a cookie. The lamb was prepared medium rare but it was so tender it melted in my mouth. The skin was crispy just like you would expect from the preparation of ""suckling"" anything such as suckling pig. There were a couple of pieces of mini cucumber that were refreshing. This was the shoulder and yet it was the most tender and best piece of lamb I have ever had. The next course was a pallet cleanser. Hibiscus Flower with Pisco sour. It worked! The Fish Bowl was next. Everything in the bowl was made to look like something from the ocean but was made of desert ingredients, yogurt, churro, white chocolate and raspberry flavourings. In the shape of lobster clams and seashells. Great, creative and not over sweet. The Poche Egg, brown egg shell which I thought was real. Fortunately the waiter stopped me from picking it up out of curiosity.  The shell, though brown was made of white chocolate. The white of the egg was a coconut base. Delicious!!! The blackboard had dried sticks of passion fruit. The letters were made of ginger sweet bread. Thee was a biscuit which had a Yuzu mousse on it. The wines by the glass were: Terra Remota: caminante 2012  D. O. Empanorda Pezas da Portela 2011  D. O. Valdeorras Eidos Ermos 2011   D. O. Ribrio In summation: The chef's method is understated and yet it is perfection. Having this meal made me so happy. The environment. The service. The presentation.  The quality. The chef's wondrous, creative combinations. This whole experience was truly Amazing, something to be had by all.",2014-04-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or290-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27692,0.011,0.86,0.129,0.9986,0.2847652236652237,0.5228282828282829,0.31893125,4777,385,0.0805945153862256,10,129,False,120,0.1578947368421052,0.1526315789473684,0.2736842105263158,0.1105263157894736,0.1789473684210526,0.0157894736842105,0.0157894736842105,0.0210526315789473,0.0526315789473684,0.0210526315789473,853,441,4.594372801875733,0,0,begin select three option menu select photo one select made adjust wife allergi dislik without hesit take good look menu edibl made potato serv mayonnais peanut oil thought went eat menu price forget much lunch write review finish lunch biggest bargain want come back tomorrow sommeli help select differ wine glass pictur first cours game truffl duck foie gra mushroom game pigeon serv dome enclos eucalyptu smoke never foie gra like tast like blend smooth melt mouth sometim game bird gamey mild delici incred butter serv bread real wonder next caviar leaf hope pictur justic etheri way present serv leaf actual black caviar accompani onion cauliflow light cream potato caviar anoth format realli shape like leaf vein short stem cream slightli soften salti caviar brilliant next shot butter fish white asparagu seawe ikora foam top perfect balanc flavour went mouth like great wine next came celeriac cream smoke sardin appl also accompani black caviar gold caviar actual made oil fish egg flavour work togeth without one overwhelm anoth even smoke sardin mild wife serv onion soup brie chees toast said love includ pictur stage serv soup cours verdina bean cockl sea urchin foam cockl tast like came ocean bean northern spain best ever base dish like soup bean pure blend sea urchin fantast qualiti ingredi spectacular chef meri mart rosario let ingredi speak noth get way way anyth els egg bread pancetta serv light potato cream sauc cut egg flow like would expect soft boil egg pancetta mild almost tast like mild salmon pleasant posit way dish show chef take combin flavour next level way beyond qualiti ingredi appar imagin chef must go find amaz ingredi red mullet saffron bullion accompani artichok shallot coconut foam shallot delici help bring dish togeth suckl lamb shoulder tandoori crumbl beyond descript brown sauc made bone lamb white sauc use yogurt crumbl fine cooki lamb prepar medium rare tender melt mouth skin crispi like would expect prepar suckl anyth suckl pig coupl piec mini cucumb refresh shoulder yet tender best piec lamb ever next cours pallet cleanser hibiscu flower pisco sour work fish bowl next everyth bowl made look like someth ocean made desert ingredi yogurt churro white chocol raspberri flavour shape lobster clam seashel great creativ sweet poch egg brown egg shell thought real fortun waiter stop pick curios shell though brown made white chocol white egg coconut base delici blackboard dri stick passion fruit letter made ginger sweet bread thee biscuit yuzu mouss wine glass terra remota caminant empanorda peza da portela valdeorra eido ermo ribrio summat chef method underst yet perfect meal made happi environ servic present qualiti chef wondrou creativ combin whole experi truli amaz someth,very good review,5

No point in going earlier - they won't let you in! But pop up the road and to your left and there's quite a good little Jazz bar.  The cooking here at el Club Allard is exceptional and the attention to detail and the level of care taken to ensure every dish is technically perfect and utterly unique is quite astonishing. I'd defy any ""foodie"" to come here without either laughing with enthusiasm or saying ""WOW"" at least half a dozen times throughout the experience.  There are three different types of Tasting Menu. We went for the 12 courser - The Seduction. This comes in at €98 per person with wine on top. ( The wine caters for all budgets).  Here's what we had -  1. Soft shell crab served on a bed of smoking seaweed*. 2. Game truffle with Foie Gras and mushrooms 3. Pea ravioli with Iberique dewlap 4. Celeriac cream with smoked sardine and apple 5. Onion Soup 6. Egg with bread, pancetta, and potato cream 7. Grouper with Korean marinade 8. Suckling lamb shoulder with Tandoori crumble*.  9.Hibiscus flower with pisco sour 10.

Also when you arrive it looks like a an entrance to very nice apartments so please do not be put off by this. On arrival we were seated to what seemed like a private dining area which was just lovely. The staff were superb very professional and explained everything we needed to know. The service was impeccable. If your visiting Madrid make sure you book a table as you will not regret it as it was quite simply one of the best foodie experiences that I have ever had. I'm not going to say anymore as I would not want to take away the magic of this place and you will understand once you have your own experience.

When we eventually got into the restaurant, it almost felt like we were entering some sort of secret society, it was all very quiet and service didn't started until everyone was seated.I half expected a Master of Ceremonies to step in and announce dinner was served!  And so the food began...course after wonderful course of unusual, very rich and inventive dishes. We had asked the Sommelier to recommend some wine so a new & delicious glass of wine came every 2 courses, Unfortunately, four courses in my Husband wasn't feeling very well and had to stop eating (nothing to do with the Restaurant food) so I sat there eating the remaining 8 courses (along with the extra wine he couldn't drink) myself and had to then go through every course in detail when he eventually could stomach the thought! I have to say though, the Restaurant were fantastic and constantly ensured he was OK, providing water and they took some money off the bill which they didn't need to do. I could go on about each course but it would spoil the surprise! I do agree with some of the other reviews regarding some of the dishes not being as good as others (esp the Eggy Bread thing - not sure about that one) but you go for the experience of a 2 Michelin Star meal accompanied by dry ice and smoke and all the quirky things you'd expect from a restaurant of this calibre. It's a great experience and if you're a real foodie like I am, you'll go regardless of what peoples reviews are. I would definitely go back again but I would probably go for one of the smaller menus, it's not that the portions were huge, it's just that the food is very rich and I started to lose myself in a heady cocktail of Cavier, Cava and Truffle, much to the embarrassment of my poorly Husband who had to escort me home!",2014-03-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or290-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27715,0.051,0.819,0.13,0.9912,0.1711776859504132,0.6035889194980105,0.4549499999999999,2091,201,0.0961262553802008,4,49,False,76,0.1097560975609756,0.1219512195121951,0.2317073170731707,0.0975609756097561,0.1707317073170731,0.0365853658536585,0.048780487804878,0.048780487804878,0.0853658536585365,0.048780487804878,388,228,4.389175257731959,0,0,start begin book tabl pm arriv think would somewher wait seat stood pour rain street corner wonder half hour spot littl cafe road rather nice glass wine eventu got restaur almost felt like enter sort secret societi quiet servic start everyon seat half expect master ceremoni step announc dinner serv food began cours wonder cours unusu rich invent dish ask sommeli recommend wine new delici glass wine came everi cours unfortun four cours husband feel well stop eat noth restaur food sat eat remain cours along extra wine drink go everi cours detail eventu could stomach thought say though restaur fantast constantli ensur ok provid water took money bill need could go cours would spoil surpris agre review regard dish good other esp eggi bread thing sure one go experi michelin star meal accompani dri ice smoke quirki thing expect restaur calibr great experi real foodi like go regardless peopl review would definit go back would probabl go one smaller menu portion huge food rich start lose headi cocktail cavier cava truffl much embarrass poorli husband escort home,average review,3

Looking for a good place to eat close to my guesthouse on Calle Atocha, I saw El Alambique Taberna, and remembered that it had gotten great reviews on Tripadvisor. So I stopped in for lunch, hoping that they had a good Menu del Dia. And they did! For anyone looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price, this is often a good option. I do have some basic Spanish, but decided to just let the friendly, helpful waitress and owner bring me what was on the special ""menu of the day"". If you are in a decent restaurant, it is fun to just go with the flow, and see what comes to your table. The first course was pimento or peppers (I think!) over spiced eggplant, and it was delicious. The second course was a huge portion of a fish that was so moist, tender, flaky and flavorful that I savored each bite. At that point, I was getting full, but couldn't bear to turn down dessert---a lovely flan with a coffee flavored topping. Delicious. All of this, plus bread and a glass of white wine for about 11-12 euros. What a deal! I did notice other Americans coming in---likely thanks to Tripadvisor---but there seemed to be a lot of locals as well, always a good sign. The atmosphere was charming, and I never felt uncomfortable as a single woman dining alone. I would definitely return---with friends to share this lovely experience!",2014-10-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2667298-Reviews-or60-El_Alambique_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_152,0.018,0.728,0.254,0.9976,0.3391997354497353,0.5447089947089947,0.39963125,1408,132,0.09375,4,53,False,56,0.1558441558441558,0.2077922077922078,0.2987012987012987,0.0909090909090909,0.1688311688311688,0.0129870129870129,0.0,0.0129870129870129,0.0259740259740259,0.0259740259740259,260,175,4.4192307692307695,0,0,end septemb madrid friend miss flight look good place eat close guesthous call atocha saw el alambiqu taberna rememb gotten great review tripadvisor stop lunch hope good menu del dia anyon look decent meal reason price often good option basic spanish decid let friendli help waitress owner bring special menu day decent restaur fun go flow see come tabl first cours pimento pepper think spice eggplant delici second cours huge portion fish moist tender flaki flavor savor bite point get full bear turn dessert love flan coffe flavor top delici plu bread glass white wine euro deal notic american come like thank tripadvisor seem lot local well alway good sign atmospher charm never felt uncomfort singl woman dine alon would definit return friend share love experi,good review,4

Boy did they ever do me right; El Alambique exactly fit the bill. I did lunch here 2 different times and each time it was very good. The gazpacho was great and they serve it with side peppers, onions, and tomatoes.

This restaurant is amazing at every level! It starts with the arrival: We were greeted at the red door like in a private club. Then they sat us at a very big and private table. The chef came to say hello and welcome us in his restaurant. Then the 7 courses menu started (No menu, it is a set meal and it changes every week). Scampi with avocado ice cream as a starter, chicken with potato and pear purée, fish with pumpkin sauce,... then I just lost track and just ate... the food was just out of this world amazing. The service was completely personalized and the chef came again at the end to hear if we like the dinner.  And you would think this dinner would have been crazy expensive, well, not at all. Do not get me wrong, you can't eat for less money in Madrid, but the price for a meal like the one we had was well below expectations.

It was late on a Saturday afternoon and we (my husband and I and our 3 teenagers) were tired, hot and hungry. We had been looking for ""local"" restaurant for the last 2 days and had been somewhat dissapointed. This is exactly the restaurant you are looking for if you want a restaurant that is off the beaten path and is local - it was full of locals and others stopping by for a drink to greet the owner and the staff. The owner could not have been friendlier. While we speak some Spanish, he went out of his way to enlist a customer to help us with words we did not know and even brought out fresh beef and honey when that did not work to show us what was on the menu! Two of us got the lunch menu which at 13 euros was a great deal. My husband got the gazpacho soup (which was by far our favorite so far - they give you onions, tomoatoes, peppers and celery to put in the soup at your choosing) and a steak with carmelized onions and fries, a beer and coffee. My son ordered teh eggplant with honey which was amazing (and again, our favorite so far as we have had this) and huevos rotos (fried eggs over fries), a soda and the most amazing cheesecake that is homemade with chocolate sauce. We also had a mango salad and sanwiches that were delicious and priced well (3 euros). In addition to wonderful food, everyone was so friendly and we all left with smiles on our face. I know we will always remember this and hope to visit again.",2013-07-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2667298-Reviews-or60-El_Alambique_Taberna-Madrid.html,UID_27744,0.035,0.817,0.148,0.9911,0.31,0.6126666666666667,0.3743583333333333,1636,166,0.1014669926650366,1,36,False,55,0.1071428571428571,0.1964285714285714,0.3214285714285714,0.0535714285714285,0.1785714285714285,0.0357142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0892857142857142,0.0178571428571428,316,183,4.180379746835443,0,0,stumbl upon el alambiqu visit prado museum happi exactli restaur look want restaur thte beaten path late saturday afternoon husband teenag tire hot hungri look local restaur last day somewhat dissapoint exactli restaur look want restaur beaten path local full local other stop drink greet owner staff owner could friendlier speak spanish went way enlist custom help us word know even brought fresh beef honey work show us menu two us got lunch menu euro great deal husband got gazpacho soup far favorit far give onion tomoato pepper celeri put soup choos steak carmel onion fri beer coffe son order teh eggplant honey amaz favorit far huevo roto fri egg fri soda amaz cheesecak homemad chocol sauc also mango salad sanwich delici price well euro addit wonder food everyon friendli left smile face know alway rememb hope visit,very good review,5

We like it so much that we called in everyday either for food or a few pints of Erdinger and some Mojitos. The staff couldn't have been nicer and we had a really good rapport with them, we even got some free Spanish lessons.  I have seen other reviews of this place saying that they were rushed through their meal and it was too expensive, we definitely did not have this experience at all. The staff are well trained and courteous, even to having to deal with a group of 5 Irish men who want to sit for hours and enjoy a few, maybe several drinks. Empty plates are cleared away promptly to allow you to relax clutter free. As for the food itself, we found it delicious and well worth the price.

That's about the only positives I can say about it. The service was slow and not particularly friendly. We ordered a selection of tapas and a few drinks. Four of the fives tapas plates were just OK, nothing special. The fifth, the Chilli Pollo, was massively undercooked. It was cold, gooey, and bloody. Definitely not the way chicken should be cooked.

I am vegetarian and knew that I had had a good experience in Barcelona and thought I would be fine. I ordered the vegetarian croquettes and my boyfriend ordered the ham croquettes. Luckily I opened mine up before eating to double check, I was unsure they were vegetarian so asked two separate waitresses who both said they were vegetarian. I then ate some trusting them and could immediately taste the meat. I went to the manager to ask and he said yes they are the meat ones. They were on the wrong colour coded plate. Completely ruined my lunch as I didn’t want to eat anything else.  We asked the manager what he could do and he took the croquettes off the bill however paying €32 for a meal that we had barely eaten when I was visibly upset (I have been vegetarian for 15 years) still seemed unfair to me. I asked the manager for his name and he carried on avoiding me however he printed our bill so we have his name.

When we arrived it was buzzing with a mixture of tourists and a few locals, all waiting for a table or eating their tapas at the bar. We waited for around 20 minutes with a jug of sangria (would recommend) before sitting at a cosy table by the window. If you are looking for an authentic Spanish taberna experience with friendly staff and great food then this is the place. The menu was in Spanish and English which was useful for us, and the waitress advised that half portions were available which meant we could order and taste a bigger selection of dishes. Everything we ordered tasted great, and it seemed like everyone around us was enjoying theirs too. It was very reasonably priced as well which was a bonus. I would advise to either arrive a little early or be prepared to wait. Several groups walked in and straight back out whilst we were there, purely due to the number of customers in such a small place.

The kitchen is open until midnight, so it is a great place for late night food.  There was a small Spanish jazz cafe bar down the road nearby where we spent the time.  Once we got our table the menu looked good. There is a selection of main plates (some are available as half portions, if you want to have more of a tapas-style dinner) as well as appetizers and tapas. The tapas selection itself is small (six items) but we supplemented with an appetizer (ham croquettes - fantastic!), a cheese plate, and a half portion of the ropa vieja and it was more than enough food for two.  From the tapas menu we ordered moussaka, quiche, patatas bravas, and salmorejo (a cold creamy tomato soup with ham). The salmorejo was particularly delicious, especially with the fresh bread served. The patatas bravas were not the best we’ve had (very smoky flavor) but everything else was excellent.  The sangria was fantastic, so much so that we ordered a second jug.  This cost us €66 which I think is pretty good value for money.  We would definitely return when in Madrid again.

We turned up without a booking about 9.30 and I think we got lucky finding a lull between early eating tourists and late eating locals. Others were not so lucky. We speak no Spanish so having an English version of the menu was a godsend. The staff in general do not speak English but will find you the one who does speak a bit if necessary. We had four tapas for two people: tortilla, vegetable cerviche, cheese and bacon quesadilla, and suckling pig. All were outstanding with the tortilla the best I have had in Spain (and I eat it at least once a day), the marinated vegetables a tasty surprise in a city that seems to abhor vegetables, the quesadilla a fine balance between good cheese and bacon and fresh tomato salsa. But the pig was the thing, melting meat attached to crispy skin and served with suitably peppery rocket and a potato thing.

They seated me without a fuss but the only people I saw in there - one table when I walked in and a bunch of people after were clearly tourists based on whether they made reservations or not. The few locals who came either stood at the counter or ordered a drink and then sat at a table, however, I am not disparaging this restaurant, just saying if you want to blend in with locals, come later. The waitstaff were all young men with relatively good english who are obviously used to tourists. Still they were hot and the recommendations were good.  The food was excellent; I had steak on bread topped with a quail egg, the artichokes on bread with parmesan (both hot) and the baby eels in a spinach roll (cold), washed down with a glass of house red and then 2 beers.

The place sits unassumingly in a street corner in the Latina quarter. You could easily walk past it and miss the most tantalising food experience of your lifetime. Fortunately that does not happen, because as soon as you venture near the open restaurant door on a Friday or Saturday night you get helplessly sucked in by a heady vortex of animated Spanish conversation, the clink of wine glasses punctuating the sounds of laughter over drum and bass, and the insanely earthy, smoky and sweet aromas wafting out of the kitchen and the bar. The place has this organic thrum to it; you instinctively recognise that somewhere in this restaurant beats the heart of Madrid.  We visited Juana La Loca twice. On those two precious opportunities I sampled the entire menu. And it was good. It was all good. This is not your traditional chorizo and tortilla tapas joint. Fresh Spanish produce is pushed to the extreme here, but always done with simplicity and minimalist artistic flair. Clearly taste and freshness are paramount, with stunning visual impact following close behind. Seared foie gras with candied hazelnuts. Black fideua and squid butifarra. That tortilla with caramelised onion. Oh that tortilla. That tortilla puts the world right. On both occasions we were served by Dani el Venezolano. His level of service is beyond measure... and he also prepares the best mojitos in town. I'll end this here with a few words a friend of ours told us before we went on holiday to Madrid: ""If there is one place you should go for tapas in Madrid, it's Juana La Loca.""",2013-06-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d779707-Reviews-or480-Juana_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_27824,0.015,0.864,0.121,0.9851,0.1383004926108374,0.5296798029556651,0.263025,1719,135,0.0785340314136125,0,41,False,48,0.14,0.2,0.34,0.1,0.16,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,299,201,4.745819397993311,0,0,friend said us one place go tapa madrid juana la loca complet understand said place sit unassumingli street corner latina quarter could easili walk past miss tantalis food experi lifetim fortun happen soon ventur near open restaur door friday saturday night get helplessli suck headi vortex anim spanish convers clink wine glass punctuat sound laughter drum bass insan earthi smoki sweet aroma waft kitchen bar place organ thrum instinct recognis somewher restaur beat heart madrid visit juana la loca twice two preciou opportun sampl entir menu good good tradit chorizo tortilla tapa joint fresh spanish produc push extrem alway done simplic minimalist artist flair clearli tast fresh paramount stun visual impact follow close behind sear foie gra candi hazelnut black fideua squid butifarra tortilla caramelis onion oh tortilla tortilla put world right occas serv dani el venezolano level servic beyond measur also prepar best mojito town end word friend told us went holiday madrid one place go tapa madrid juana la loca,very good review,5

Though it was difficult to find and we could not find it without GPS since it was in the middle of intersection of small streets, it was worth the effort. We have been there because it was close to our hotel and had so many good comments. We liked there so much that we have been there every night in our 4 day trip. First of all, the service is very good. The staff is friendly, fast and speak English very well. The waiter you see in the photos is a very kind man and we chatted with him quite a lot. He prepares excellent sangrias! We had the one of the best sangrias we had in Spain here.  We first went to El Sur to have some snacks and tried a couple of tapas and dishes. After that, we have been there every night in our 4 day trip and liked almost everything we have tried. The only thing we could not manage to eat was king prawns since they were in high demand and they did not have any left whenever we requested. But they looked really good! Still, the most outstanding item was sangria for me. Though taste was not unique and changing from night to night (and best one being prepared by the waiter in the photo!), it was really really good.

We asked for advice from the waiter on what and how much to order and his suggestions were perfect. Between 2 people, we shared 1/2 portions of the risotto and the curry chicken and a full order of the steak. Each dish was so amazing that it was sad to eat the last bite. We also shared the cheesecake and passion fruit cake - normally I would say plain cheesecake is a bit boring but this far exceeded my expectations.

It looks like a group of friends running the place and it makes for such a nice atmosphere! They even gave us a little digestif after our meal and 3 of the staff joined us to do a shot! So we went back on our final night and they seemed pleased we had returned! The solomillo el sur was delicious, pork in a moscatel sauce! We also really liked the salad with orange which we shared as a starter. We didn't have tapas as a meal but tried the croquetas de jamon the second time we went as it was a bit early for dinner and they were yummy too!

In fact, I don't use TA for restaurant recommendations for this very reason. Located just off the beaten tourist path from the main center, easy enough to find and cute narrow classic interior. But don't expect to find any Spanish people eating here. Service was marginal and my Spanish friend was shocked when the waiter laid down a bill as we finished our meal without asking (including a card asking that we leave a review - so here is it!) Food was simply OK, nothing special and prices typical inner city, a bit expensive for what it was. Seating is a bit uncomfortable.

Last evening for example in Madrid I experienced some difficulty in finding Taberna El Sur. We were staying in the Huertas area of Madrid and the restaurant was tauntily close, a mere ten minute walk away. Due to construction on Calle Atocha as well as navigating a 6 way intersection, the phone app showed us as being at our destination or being 5 minutes away, or just by turning around extending our ETA by an additional 5 minutes. The solution was to keep walking around down one street up another until we found ourselves outside the door of our destination. Dizzy when you are hungry but definitely worth the trouble when the restaurant proved itself outstanding. The actual Taberna is small with a bar and sidewall of tables and benches extending to the back. We were presented with a handwritten suggestion for the meal available for that evening but opted for the standard menu and wine listing by the glass. We had decided to share the plates and order more if our appetites were too large. We started with a Mediterranean Salad which included orange slices and pitted green olives, as well as an order of grilled squid with Spanish salad with some fresh corn. My wife had a glass of Rose while I had a fine Rioja. Everthing was excellent. Our server Jose was super attentive and knowledgable. Still hungry we opted for shrimps in garlic sauce as well as patatas bravas which were covered in a fine tomato sauce with smoked paprika. Two different red Riojas were also consumed. There was some good hot bread for dipping in the sauces. We followed this up with some Cava served in a flute glass with a blackberry in each which spun as it trapped the bubbles. We also received a complementary cheesecake as well as 2 almond cream liqueurs. All of this for just over 40 Euros.  You have to go. Exceptional food and service.",2018-08-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or890-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_26431,0.034,0.838,0.127,0.9879,0.1925887021475257,0.4272642390289449,0.33167,1936,162,0.0836776859504132,0,25,False,65,0.1111111111111111,0.1587301587301587,0.3015873015873015,0.0634920634920634,0.1269841269841269,0.0317460317460317,0.0,0.0476190476190476,0.0952380952380952,0.0634920634920634,342,215,4.6608187134502925,0,0,problem use map applic smart phone visit older citi europ last even exampl madrid experienc difficulti find taberna el sur stay huerta area madrid restaur tauntili close mere ten minut walk away due construct call atocha well navig way intersect phone app show us destin minut away turn around extend eta addit minut solut keep walk around one street anoth found outsid door destin dizzi hungri definit worth troubl restaur prove outstand actual taberna small bar sidewal tabl bench extend back present handwritten suggest meal avail even opt standard menu wine list glass decid share plate order appetit larg start mediterranean salad includ orang slice pit green oliv well order grill squid spanish salad fresh corn wife glass rose fine rioja everth excel server jose super attent knowledg still hungri opt shrimp garlic sauc well patata brava cover fine tomato sauc smoke paprika two differ red rioja also consum good hot bread dip sauc follow cava serv flute glass blackberri spun trap bubbl also receiv complementari cheesecak well almond cream liqueur euro go except food servic,very good review,5

The waiter Jose was friendly, patient and attentive with our orders and questions. We chose to sample different tapas with different wines. Our first tapas included the squid and an insalata and I chose the only Rosée on the wine menu. If you like wine it was a superb choice. The next course included shrimp and patatas brava with a recommended red Sancho Garces ...super Delicious! You know service is good when the waiter can quickly evaluate your style and recommends choices that you will like. Jose did exactly that and his choices were great both for wine and food.

After viewing the paintings of the tragic mad Queen at the Prado head over to the lovely La Latina neighborhood for the most exciting tapas in Madrid. You can fight the crowd at the bar but it's best to put your name on the list for a table and enjoy a glass of wine or beer while you wait. The turnover is quick so the wait is not usually long as it's always packed with locals jostling for space at the bar. While not cheap the tapas are outstanding. Our favorites are the soft shell crab and the cochinillo crugiente which is roasted succulent pork with crispy skin. Accompanied by the wonderful spidery fried artichokes they make a meal as the portions are generous. Be sure to order everything you want when placing your order as the waiters are quite busy and move at lightning speed so catching their attention again can be challenging until the order arrives at your table. Don't be shy and just squeeze your way to the register to add your name to the list when you arrive and you will be rewarded with the most imaginative and tasty tapas that Madrid has to offer ...

You cannot make a reservation after 9 PM, but You get your name on the waiting list, a relax in the bar. I was waiting less that half an hour, enjoying the nice buzz and music. Sweetbread was very good. A beautiful looking, delicate, tasteful dish. Ravioli with truffles was very good as well. I found the roastbeef to be too vulgar, big and soft. The other dishes had the contrast in textures - crunch and soft, which is what we want... An ok bottle of Ribera with some maturity for an ok price. The withe chocolate desert with raspberry was also nice. They can cook and they have good service and atmosphere. They have some good bottles of wine like Mauro, but they have got a extremely limited selection of sherry; One mainstream Manzanilla and Fino (Tio Pepe) and one PX. The wines by the glass are not very impressive...

Everything was absolutely delicious. The dressing on the salad was really special. Having said that, when it was time to order one more tapas, we ordered another huevos rotos. Ah-mazing.

For €6 we got two chicken skewers, which I think is a completely fair price. My dad had already eaten one of the two chicken skewers, and I decided to cut open the other one. It wasn't just a little pink or rosé in the middle, no this piece of chicken was completely raw. Misstakes happen, so I called the waitress to inform her about the chicken skewer. The waitress told me it looked raw because of the way the chicken was grilled. I told her that doesn't explain why it is entirely raw throughout. She started laughing and said ""So what do you want me to do now, you have eaten almost the whole dish,"" referring to the skewer my dad already ate. We didn't expect her to give us an entire new dish or any discounts, just say sorry for the misstake the kitchen made and give us ONE SINGLE not raw chicken skewer. In the end, we were charged for the entire chicken dish, although we couldn't eat half of it. For 30€ per person I expect to not have to worry about eating raw chicken and getting sick. Horrible service that laughed in my face when I showed her the chicken I was served was raw.

For the price this is good. The options are of course quite simplistic, what battered fish, egg and chips, but good and as you would expect for the price of the set menu. I asked about an item from the a la carte menu, which they took to mean I was ordering it. It turned up unexpectedly, before anyone else had ordered when I was away from the table, so the other person at my table didn't send it back. It was the mushroom 'pie' - which was actually just a small dish of cheap white mushrooms cooked in cream for nearly the whole price of the set menu. Another dish I had enquired about (but definitely not ordered, I just asked what it was) also turned up unexpectedly at the table a little later. I was present this time so told them that I had just asked about it, and not ordered it. It was unclear if this was a genuine misunderstanding or if they just hoped we would be too polite to send back the a la carte items. I hope it was the former, but having tried one of the a la carte items I would suggest others don't bother as the are pretty poor for the price.

The wine list is expansive, and there are bottles from all over Europe. The prices range from around 20-25 to the more expensive end of the spectrum, so it’s perfect for those looking for a nice easy wine to have with the dishes during lunch or dinner, or really good wine, for a special occasion.  We loved the fact that there was a sommelier explaining the origin and history of each bottle… again.. quite refreshing. I can only thing of previous trips to France where such emphasis and thought was put into the selection. This isn’t a restaurant with wine, more a Wine bar with food.  Like the wines, the dishes had international influences and inspiration, from empanadas to hummus, croquetas, and ceviche, each dish had a perfect wine to match.

The standard quality of the dishes may look very expensive but the always result, it’s very very affordable! 3. There are so many compliments from the house, they have never failed to surprise me. I almost forgot the table setting and decoration, simplicity is beauty! The lighting system of the restaurant is so soft and very comfortable to the eyes. What else I can say, my comments are never enough. 4.

My family and I arrived here at 8 p.m. for dinner at this 2 Michelin-starred restaurant. Located in the 5-star Hyatt hotel Hesperia Madrid, the restaurant was famous throughout Spain for its signature cuisine and exquisite dishes. As soon as we arrived, a staff member with a suit greeted us and asked us whether we would like valet parking. We happily accepted, and he drove our car to the parking lot. When we entered the restaurant, a waiter led us to our table. It was beautiful, and the table looked like it was fit for the royal family. However, the seats did not match, which did make sense as the reservation was hastily made 12 hours in advance. The waiter was exceptionally kind and offered us water service and a personal breadbasket preparation.  I ordered a ""Young Goat"" as my main course and a ""White Chocolate Creamy"" as the dessert. The goat was incredibly juicy and tasty; I didn't even need a knife as it was so tender. The smoke on the hazelnut was great, and the sweetness of the roast pumpkin matched the umami of the goat. The dessert was just as great. The sweetness of the white chocolate with the freshness of the passion fruit was heavenly.  Overall, this is, by far, my favorite Michelin-starred restaurant(so far). I'd give the ambiance a 5, food a 4.75, the presentation a 4, the pricing a 4.75, and the service a 4.75.",2020-03-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717403-Reviews-Santceloni-Madrid.html,UID_28070,0.0,0.829,0.171,0.9931,0.4140350877192982,0.6333333333333334,0.4214533333333333,1386,113,0.0815295815295815,1,48,False,51,0.1132075471698113,0.2452830188679245,0.3962264150943396,0.0188679245283018,0.2075471698113207,0.0,0.0,0.0188679245283018,0.0,0.0,247,160,4.607287449392713,0,0,restaurant santceloni real gem famili arriv p dinner michelin star restaur locat star hyatt hotel hesperia madrid restaur famou throughout spain signatur cuisin exquisit dish soon arriv staff member suit greet us ask us whether would like valet park happili accept drove car park lot enter restaur waiter led us tabl beauti tabl look like fit royal famili howev seat match make sens reserv hastili made hour advanc waiter except kind offer us water servic person breadbasket prepar order young goat main cours white chocol creami dessert goat incred juici tasti even need knife tender smoke hazelnut great sweet roast pumpkin match umami goat dessert great sweet white chocol fresh passion fruit heavenli overal far favorit michelin star restaur far give ambianc food present price servic,very good review,5

I had been purposely searching for a great Michelin starred restaurant to go with my parents for the holidays when I stumbled upon this gem. When we came to this restaurant at our reservation, we didn’t have the same chairs as a set like the others. It was fair I guess, since the reservation was made 12 hours before. Our waiter was extremely kind, and he tried his best to communicate with us. The food was excellent but it could be better. I had the young goat and white chocolate creamy. The goat was flavorful and tender, but I would have liked a few more diverse ingredients on the plate. The dish was a steak of goat and some pumpkin purée on the side. If I were to change it, I would have added a few vegetables or mushrooms. The whites chocolate creamy was excellent though. It was sweet and the passion fruit balanced it out perfectly. Overall Santceloni is an excellent place for special events and just has a few minor kinks. I give the food a 4.2, the environment a 4.6, the service a 4.5, and the pricing a 3.9.

We were 2 indian couples who called them to book a table for 4 and asked them for any discounts if possible. The app - ""the fork"" gives a 40% off on the same restaurant if we book online, so we told them the same and they promised us a 40% disc. On arrival we again mentioned the conversation we had on phone and this lady on the counter agreed for a 40% off on our food bill. After eating our full meal, the bill came out for a 20% off on just the main course dishes, rest all other items- salad, breads, drinks were charged full. On our request and a little argument, they agreed to give a 40% off on just the main dishes, but this wasn't enough. That lady named pammy mocked us on our way back, blaming us for an unfair demand, whereas everything was asked and planned before hand. This female was ready to insult her own country citizens in front of everyone, was continuously shaming us and wasn't ready to listen.

Sure, it's a tad expensive, but the old adage of 'you get what you pay for' applies here. They had Toro (tuna belly) on the menu which is super hard to find in most sushi places, and the black cod in miso was to die for. For sushi fans, you'll be glad to know that they had real, freshly grated wasabi as well. The only slight minus was the beef fillet. Not that it was bad - it was good, but stopped just short of being great. I suppose we are spoilt rotten being from London and having easy access to Aberdeen Angus beef.

I ordered the Spicy tuna tartar and the Miyama style sushi. Tartar was nice but not spicy at all, but ok. No complaints still, it was a good tartar. The Miyama style sushi is ""grilled"" or flambed and had a very nice taste. Good rice. Served without wasabi and soy sauce but it was no problem. I guess it was what they wanted. The maki roll was something I hadn't had before. It was like curry tasting, but it was with fish. Anyway it was new and pleasent. Very nice. The chop sticks are the cheap type wich you break apart, not their own high quality sticks, and the locale is not upscale, but absolutely fine. Good selection of wines.

The staff are welcoming and if needed there is an English version of the menu. Delicious coffe and tomato tostado in the morning. The tostado with mushroom and parmesan topping, and the one with melted cheese and tomato pesto are both delicious, also the spinach salad with walnuts, cheese and a divine mustard dressing. A meat eating friend approved of the jamon iberico. We always share as the portions are generous.

With its excellent service throughout from food to wine, this restaurant certainly has an air of class and seated at, what must be, the best seat in the house (the chef’s table) with an excellent view of the kitchen and the large team within, we were fortunate enough to be afforded a constant view of their preparations, which they undertook continuously in a relaxed and organised fashion working in unison to prepare exemplary dishes, of the highest standard and finest quality, course after course.  We opted for the taster menu, each dish perfectly portioned allowing you to enjoy the entire 13 courses. Taken with the accompanying Spanish wine selection we found that we were presented with perfect food and wine combinations throughout the meal, which allowed us to benefit magnificently from our gastronomic experience. Having to choose a favourite, and least favourite, dish is nigh on impossible as there was nothing I did not favour, from start to finish. However, I will endeavor to try by saying that least would have to be Maresme peas and best would have been the goat shoulder. The well designed menu is interesting and varied and the excellent team in the kitchen crafted it perfectly in such a way that its creator could surely not fail to be proud of,  Santceloni serves up the best cheese board I have ever seen and this would be a selection any cheese lover would die for and each of our assisted Spanish varieties were amazing. Excellence is the key word at Santceloni and the desserts, along with dessert wines, and amazing petit fours followed on in the same vein as the previous service and dishes and I was served an excellent brandy Alexander. With its impeccable service and food, Santceloni was heading for my overall number one but unfortunately, the final meal of our stay has pushed it into a joint number one position both holders, of which, now hail from this magnificent city. Santceloni is well worthy of its 2 stars and more. We had the most wonderful evening’s dining in a restaurant that takes pride in its exceptional standards and I would have no hesitation, from our visit alone, to award the highest recommendation as a definite ‘must try’ and, in my opinion, it would be remiss to visit Madrid without enjoying the delights that Santceloni has to offer.

Seating in the sofa was very very uncomfortable.  Ordered from Menu of the day. Took a lot of time to get the starters, 2 chicken samosas. The taste was below average.  After a while came the Lamb kofta, which too was not that great... It lacked spice and seemed to be made as a sweet dish.  The Naan (pan hindu or Indian bread ) was very bad. It was more crunchy than soft.  I felt as if I was having a papa (pappadum) rather than a naan. It was way too difficult to eat.  As I was already late, I had to skip the dessert.  My recommendation : If you are into Indian food or if you are from India, Doli is not at all recommended.

From the moment you enter the restaurant oozes class and expense accounts. As we were fairly tired from our journey we decided not to take the tasting menu (175 Euros) but opted for the wide ranging A La Carte instead.  Tables are massive and the chairs sublimely comfortable and there are wonderfully decorative place settings.  There were plenty of appetisers and excellent selection of bread with olive oil and all in all some high class dishes well presented with excellent tastes and textures without being quite ""cutting edge"". Presentation throughout was first class and although we did not have it the two cheese tables looked fabulous! Staff are formally dressed and overall the place was rather smart, the wine list is very comprehensive although a little on the expensive side compared to the other 2 star establishments we visited. Overall the cost was 385 Euros for three courses, a bottle of the wonderful Kripta Cava from Augusto Torello (which comes in an amphora shaped bottle), mineral water and coffee and this is very much at top pricing and more expensive than other such rated establishments.

We were very happy that this ended up being our main event in Madrid as it is everything we hoped to experience in a restaurant here. From the minute you walk in, you know you're in for a treat. The staff are super friendly and helpful, the room is beautiful and the food was exquisite. We chose the chef's menu so we could try a wide range of dishes. The dishes look amazing and the staff explain all the dishes so you know exactly what to expect. We went on a Monday so there were only 2 other tables which meant that the service was probably even better than usual. Every dish was delicious and it is hard to pick a favourite: the starters ( and there were about 5) were amazing and the young goat was tender and came with perfect accompaniment of pumpkin and hazelnut. A surprise for me was the eel and chicken soup - delicious and without the overpowering eel flavour that I find in many eel dishes. Of the 3 desserts, the tea slushy with mint and yogurt icecream was the pick for me - a bit of a palate cleanser after a big meal. A few people have mentioned the cheese tables which are definitely impressive and the waiters select the cheeses that they feel will suit the diner's palate - which they did perfectly. I am the only wine drinker and requested the sommelier choose a couple of wines to match and this was also a perfect match for me. Husband ordered his standard whiskey sour and the cocktail bar and waiter come to the table to shake it up. He was the highlight - super enthused and worth a cocktail just for him. This was a perfect end to our days in Madrid and we loved the meal and the experience at Santceloni - definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to experience high end dining, service and a beautiful space.

Oddly the sommelier was one guy rushing about from table to table, bringing the glassware himself after the course had arrived, then rushing off to find the bottle and able to spend no more than a hurried naming of the wine before rushing off to be late to another table. The standout dish was the delicious cheese cart at the end of the meal. They have an very good cheese buyer, but it's hardly a reason to dine here.

On our first night in town we wandered around the neighborhood to get our bearings. There was a certain vibe that exuded from the walls and windows of Quiroga. We stopped in for what was our first of three visits during the week! The staff is cheery but not nosey. The food and beverages were spectacular. We ordered their house wines and were floored by their price point for value. We tried a number of their tintos that were Syrahs and Temperanios. A favorite tapas was called 'Gildas'. It was a stick that pierced a number of olives, peppers, dried tomatoes and anchovies. Flavorful but not salty. Great selection of cheeses and thin sliced Jamones.

Therefore it was obvious that we wanted to try it once more. We started off with sashimi then we had a selection of nigiris and maki rolls. The sashimi was amazing!

They tried to be innovative and it just did not work for all the rolls. Who wants curry on the tempura shrimp maki? It all tasted like curry! Still, their spicy tuna maki was amazing with a lovely spicy mayonnaise on the side. The service was good, the staff were fast and friendly. Still the scenery of the restaurant was only okay.

The Service was impeccable. Staff was friendly and did not miss a beat. The cheese course was the highlight of the night and all the cheeses were not theirs. I am not sure the restaurant deserves the second star, one for sure. I think this place was the second most expensive out of all the places we ate and I would not return there.

The restaurant provided us with excellent service and made us feel welcome and special from the moment we arrived. One unique feature of this restaurant was that you could view the food being made and the chefs working behind a large glass viewing area. While a bit voyeuristic, it helped you really appreciate the preparation, effort, and teamwork that the staff demonstrated and the intricacy that goes into each dish. Our server immediately provided us with water, a sommelier provided wine recommendations, and while they have an a la carte option with prices around 50E per entree, we went right for the tasting menu. The food was delicious and each dish was creatively designed and packed with flavor. We especially enjoyed the white gazpacho, duck lasagna, and lacquered white pork rib. Each of the other dishes were tasty in their own right, but these stood out in particular. Another amazing aspect of the restaurant was the cheese trolley, as two tables of cheese were carried over to us with a wide selection of Spanish and French cheeses. The staff made recommendations and then hacked off large chunks of cheese for us to try (needless to say we could not finish, but not out of lack of trying).  We also appreciated the personal service and special touch that the staff gave us. As they knew this was a special occasion, they provided my wife with a bouquet of flowers with the check.  During our trip, we had visited 9 Michelin-recognized restaurants and Santceloni ranked up there with the best. What really stood out to us was the service and the opportunity to better appreciate the chefs at their craft.",2018-10-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717403-Reviews-or10-Santceloni-Madrid.html,UID_28296,0.011,0.838,0.151,0.9929,0.299615975422427,0.5287480798771123,0.4931692307692307,1747,142,0.0812821980538065,1,30,False,71,0.1320754716981132,0.2264150943396226,0.3962264150943396,0.0566037735849056,0.1509433962264151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0377358490566037,0.0,300,180,4.82,0,0,santceloni capston three week vacat spain portug end honeymoon high note restaur provid us excel servic made us feel welcom special moment arriv one uniqu featur restaur could view food made chef work behind larg glass view area bit voyeurist help realli appreci prepar effort teamwork staff demonstr intricaci goe dish server immedi provid us water sommeli provid wine recommend la cart option price around e per entre went right tast menu food delici dish creativ design pack flavor especi enjoy white gazpacho duck lasagna lacquer white pork rib dish tasti right stood particular anoth amaz aspect restaur chees trolley two tabl chees carri us wide select spanish french chees staff made recommend hack larg chunk chees us tri needless say could finish lack tri also appreci person servic special touch staff gave us knew special occas provid wife bouquet flower check trip visit michelin recogn restaur santceloni rank best realli stood us servic opportun better appreci chef craft,very good review,5

One of the cousins and his wife go there often and are treated like family, and their loyalty to the restaurant was clearly very much appreciated by the owners. The service was impeccable and the food was excellent and very creative. Lots of small plates of samplings of delicious gourmet foods. After the main dishes were served, a huge table of cheeses was presented and selections were chosen for each person individually. Also, since I was the only person whose Spanish isn’t great, one of the staff explained in English what each dish was. He was wonderful!

Great flavours, high quality and well prepared. The tuna tartar (recommended rightly by many) is particularly good. The service is good, though a little manic: the lack of elegance of the waiting staff strikes a contrast with the elegance of the restaurant itself, whipping plates away and almost throwing clean ones in front of you like there was no tomorrow. (Incidentally I observed one of the waiters drinking water from a bottle in a corner of the main room which didn't particularly impress me and detracted from the impression of high class they clearly try to give). There was one small minor detail: we were ""upsold"" a starter - the waiter recommended a dish not on the main menu, but he did not mention the price. I don't mind spending money, but if you're offering something the customer can't see the details of, you MUST provide them. We had to ask, and accepted the proposal. A 22 euro tempura which frankly wasn't worth the price. It IS a little expensive (expect upwards of around 45 euro per person), but the quality does make it a good Japanese experience.

Really helpful waiting staff, who were keen to advise and help, plus menu items with titles that English curry goers will be familiar with (the descriptions were in Spanish however), such as tikka masala or korma! We had some excellent bhaji and pakora to start, after complimentary spiced poppadoms. Then reverting to more traditional korma and tikka masala. This was accompanied by the best fried rice I've ever eaten with superbly cooked and fresh naan breads. The meal was rounded off with a complimentary mango lassi which was to die for! We booked through the fork and got 40% off. Truthfully, I don't think we would have given it 5 stars had we paid normal prices, as the food appeared very expensive.

My companion chose some great anchovies to share, and an ""over-greasy"" mix of tempura vegetables (try the tempura down the road at Bar Platero to see how it should be done); he then chose a very tasty grilled red tuna with a few strands of green; my grilled sea bass came around 20 minutes later - and was raw inside.

There are 1-3 wow experiences foodwise and two or three of the wine parings was superb.  We were also impressed by the cheese tables that were immense. Also, we had no problems by the fact that it it's situated under a hotel. Except for the stair down, the place is certainly beautiful. But. Then comes the buts.  1. When we arrived they did not understand who we were.  2. They had lost the information that my friend is vegetarian and also did not ask for special needs or food preferences.  3. I sunk down in the sofa so that I felt like a child almost not reaching up to the table. I asked if possible to change table and was told I could sit on a cushion, I said no thank you its fine and still suddenly it stood a man with a cushion there trying to make me sit on it. Embarrassing situation.  4. We asked for a 1/2 wine pairing volume as we always do (it's a hobby of both of us to eat good food and combine with interesting wines but we both find that we get to drunk with a full pairing so that we can't enjoy the last meals. This request has never been a problem before anywhere in the world.) We were told that we could choose not to match the menu but to take single glas of wine instead. We said that we just wanted very small quantities to try the tastes, and then water. We agreed on this but then comes the somelier. Obviously very angry and tries to talk loud and clear with us for us to understand that the volume is good...... Not a pleasant experience at all.  Became even more awkward when the lady who took the bill to us in the end of the meal pointed out that they had put one of the two wine pairings ""on the house"". I did not know what to say.

From the moment we arrived the staff made us very welcome and the service was impeccable. The restaurant is modern and new. We opted for the grand tasting menu of 14 courses with the wine paring to match. Before we actually started with our courses we had 7 small appetisers, very tasty and different. The courses were small but ample enough so you didnt feel uncomfortable. Presentation of all the courses was perfection, well seasoned and innovative. The sommelier chose excellent paring to each course and we never ran out of wine. This was a truly memorable experience and would like to thank all the staff for their hard work. It was well appreciated. We have eaten all over the world in many michelin star restaurants and I must say this has got to be up there at the top. Prices compared to London well there is no competition. Here you get value for money and not ripped off at stupid overrated celebrity prices. We will definately be back.

The 9-course tasting menu looked overwhelming and had dishes like pig ear that no one felt like trying (the tasting menu must be ordered by everyone or not at all). The tasting menu was a bit over 160 euros and ordering 3 courses adds up to close to that--maybe 20 or 30 euros less, which is a rounding error in this context. First and second courses were imaginative and luscious--shaved chicken, prawns on lettuce, rounds of paté studded with pistachios. Second courses for us were four kinds of delectable fish. Everything here is perfectly seasoned--their philosophy is pure, perfect, honest food that they source directly. Each table is private and the setting is serene and beautiful. The small treats that they deliver throughout the meal are spectacular. Now the small flaws: dessert is not up to the standards of the meal (avoid the chocolate soup which made me think of Nestle's Quik made with cream). The dessert price of 26 euros (regardless of your choice) is not listed on the menu. Next time I would skip dessert and go straight to their after-meal tray of delicacies. They pushed water on us, opening four large bottles which we did not come close to finishing (and charging 20 euros for them). It seemed as though they were trying to make up for the fact that we didn't keep ordering wine as we all had to be alert later. These small imperfections keep the experience from being ideal. They would not occur at places like Celler de Can Roca or Arzak which make you feel as though they are totally on your side, not trying to gouge in any way.

They do not have English menus or many waiters that know English, so ordering was pretty difficult. But the food was amazing.  It's a small place, but very stylish. We made reservations at 9pm, when the restaurant opened for supper, and by about 10-10:30 the place was packed. You are supposed to see lots of celebrities there but we didn't (except for the ones on their memory wall).  We had a starter of baked cheese, it was very good. On the house they also brought out fried shrimp and Chorizo. The Chorizo, Argentina sausage, was by far the best. For the main course we had two different cuts of Argentina beef and one fish. (The fish was the last one on the fish section--I can't remember the name). My fish was moist and very tasty. There was an orange colored sauce under which was very smooth, not fruity. They also brought us some potato chips, but not your ordinary chips, these looked like mini pillows, fried. They were very addictive!! For desert, we ordered the doulche (something like that), which was vanilla ice cream on top of a cookie covered in chocolate. On the plate was a vanilla pudding with strips of chocolate over top. One of the best deserts I've ever had. They also brought us on the house warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream and these sherbet shooters. The shooters were the best probably.  Total for the food we ordered (one starter, 3 meals, 1 dessert, 2 waters, 1 beer, 1 glass of wine) our total was 135 Euros.
