We chose for the menu with benedict eggs with avocado and chocolate cake and the mushroom salad with goat cheese. Both were excellent. Mushroom salad was more filling than the eggs, although cheaper (8.5 vs 7.5). We had one with home fries and the other with hash brownies. The home fries are better. Dessert of the day was chocolate cake. It was de-li-cious!! Big coffees come with milk without asking for it, so if you like it black, mention it when you order.

These delicious eggs, served either with bacon, salmon or avocato, are the star-dish, but there are other eggs options available (rancheros, and the typical scrambled eggs with sausage and bacon on the side), and also hamburgers.  We had a mimosa and a bloody mary for drink. Both of them ok (the mimosa was made with artificial orange juice... but it costed 1€). We paid 25€ for 2 eggs benedict, 1 mimosa, 1 bloody more and 2 large cups of coffee, which is a very good value-for-money in Madrid's brunch scene. The only problem is that the place is very crowded (make sure you book your table in advance!) and the waiters, although all very nice, get a bit lost in the middle of all the fuss.",2013-03-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2073662-Reviews-or120-Carmencita_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_28403,0.081,0.82,0.099,0.4618,0.1551540616246498,0.6395564892623717,0.3776,836,73,0.0873205741626794,1,32,False,25,0.064516129032258,0.0967741935483871,0.0967741935483871,0.0967741935483871,0.032258064516129,0.0967741935483871,0.064516129032258,0.1290322580645161,0.1612903225806451,0.1612903225806451,152,105,4.5,0,0,carmencita current place brunch madrid feel tast egg benedict mouth understand delici egg serv either bacon salmon avocato star dish egg option avail ranchero typic scrambl egg sausag bacon side also hamburg mimosa bloodi mari drink ok mimosa made artifici orang juic cost paid egg benedict mimosa bloodi larg cup coffe good valu money madrid brunch scene problem place crowd make sure book tabl advanc waiter although nice get bit lost middl fuss,good review,4

We arrived and were sad to find out weekends require reservations! However, we were welcome to sit at the bar or a high top table.

Soon, we had mimosas in hand, a jug of water, and 3 seats at the bar (for about 15 minutes, before she let us know we could have a high top table).  I got the eggs benedict (one salmon, one avocado...which BTW is the way to go!!). I've never been a huge benedict fan, but after seeing someone else's plate...I had to. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. Hashbrowns were perfect and Valentina hot sauce was the perfect complement.  A friend of mine got the huevos rancheros which I didn't even get to see very much/much less try because he basically inhaled them. That good.

Decor: modern eclectic, comfy but classy...however we sat on the terrace outside, just off the Calle de Serrano... balmy Madrid night, why not?  Service: above and beyond. I've got 10 years of restaurant industry work under my belt and I love to eat out, so I can be picky. BUT 12 years in Spain has taught me that good service is not a given ever. Therefore, when it is good, I notice and I return. From the host to the bartender to the manager, everyone was friendly and kind...and fast, no waiting ages for dishes or having food come dragging out in strange stages. Food: classic Spanish fare with modern touches. Our favorites were Torta Finca.. a very strong sheep's cheese, creamy and milky, perfectly balanced with a sweet little tomato jam; Tortilla española with truffle.. taking homey fare to sublime heights; Mollete de Pringa.. pringa is like a puree of meats and it reminds me of dancing flamenco (well in my case stumbling to flamenco) at the Feria de Sevilla...here it is taken up a notch and served with a slathering of salmorejo (gazpacho's sophisticated cousin). Would skip the albondigas de abuela (grandma's meatballs) next time--bland and chewy.  Finished with Lemon Meringue cake and I can say as a born and raised Southerner, it was divine and authentic!.

Three half toasted tea cakes with each of the three salmon, bacon and avocado topped with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. This is more than enough and a reasonable 10.50 euros.

Being a Saturday evening we were expecting a larger crowd at the restaurant. But since we eat early ( in comparison to Spanish families) we were the second family entering around 8.30pm. The staff were nice and allowed us to choose the table where we would like to sit.  We chose the paapdi chaat for a starter. Then we had the chicken tikka masala, pulav and dal for mains along with a couple of tandoori rotis. I asked for the food a tad spicier compared to the previous time. While it catered to my taste, my toddler had a tough time since he is not used to it. They also offered us a palate cleanser - a mango sorbet between the appetizer and mains which was very good.

We arrived early evening and it was fairly quiet. Decorations quite bright but lovely and authentic with fabulous ganesh statues! We all ordered dishes that we knew we liked such as Chicken Tikka, Buttter Chicken, Spinach Paneer and a fish curry, popadoms on the side and peshwari naan. The food was delicious, fresh, and authentic. The poppadoms were different to your usual UK variety. They had, what I think were, cumin seeds in them and had a distinctive taste, but great, the peshwari naan had what looked like sunflower seeds and small pieces of fried fruit, such as papaya on the top but tasted delicious. The spinach panner didn't look very attractive as it arrived in a dish with paneer sitting within lots of bright green sauce, not pieces of spinach as I am used to but it tasted delicious, a lot better than it looked.

Me and my wife decided to try Swagat after reading positive reviews and we were not dissapointed. We had samosas for starters which was quite decent. This was followed by chicken curry and garlic naan. The waiter asked us if we would like it spicy and they made it as spicy as an indian curry should be. After this we have been visiting Swagat quite regularly.

I forgot to do review then so made sure I did this time. The atmosphere is great with cute decor and staff friendly with smiles. They speak both Spanish and English which is nice which makes it less intimidating. There is a good variety of food and if you request they can also make it hotter. The service was pretty fast and food was hot and full of flavor. I want to go back now and order more. Serving sizes are perfect for the price and there is no way you are leaving hungry. I loved how the food not only smells and taste amazing but the presentation of the food is very appealing. From appetizers to main course and dessert the food just pops with flavors and plenty of choices even for someone who may be picky. If in Madrid this place is definitely worth stopping by for a meal.

The restaurant was located in a very nice locality close to the Velazquez metro station and city bus stops, so locating it was not too difficult. The ambience of the restaurant was very welcoming with a beautiful intricate Ganapati statue and a glittering large chandelier at the entrance. The restaurant was quite spacious and could easily accomodate large groups of 16 - 20 with ease. The menu had a large number of options featuring both a-la-carte dishes and fixed meals. Initially, we were served papads (Indian crackers) with green chutney, a yogurt based sauce, tamarind chutney and a chilli based cutney. We ordered a starter dish consisting of an onion bhajji, a vegetable cutlet, a potato cutlet and a samosa. The starters were very good though a bit oily, but the taste was great, particularly the onion bhajji. For the main course, we had chana masala, paneer kadai, aloo gobhi and dal tadka with tandoori rotis. The food was well prepared and tasted great. This was followed by veg biriyani and a cucumber raita. The biriyani lacked a little salt, but was well prepared with paneer (Indian unsalted cottage cheese) and vegetables. The final tab / bill was not more than expected. The small sugar coated saunf (fennel seeds) that was served as mukhwas (mouth freshner) was very nice as well. The staff at the restaurant was extremely courteous and explained us the dishes properly and also enquired the amount of spice and hotness desired by us (we were a group on Indians). While leaving they also guided us to the metro stations from which we were supposed to take our connections to our hotels. Overall, we loved the food here and would come back here when and if we come down to Madrid.

Before going, we had checked the restaurant´s website, menu and various reviews from trusted websites; all in all we decided to give it a go.  The birthday girl unfortunately has strong allergies towards anything containing nuts, fish and coconut milk so before going we double checked the menu for these traces (none were found).  Upon arriving, we were seated by the manageress who was pleasant enough (this was all about to change).. After being seated, we started to skim through the menu to which there were no allergy advisories etc. so we asked the manageress, who adamantly told us that only ONE curry had coconut milk in it....as someone who loves their curry, I know full well that a main ingredient is COCONUT MILK so how was this possible? Anyway, we asked her a few more times just to be sure and stated that my friend would become extremely ill if she ate any of these ingredients.. The food came, my friend was feeling a little apprehensive so she only tried a small amount of the food to see if she got a reaction, well 10 minutes later, can you guess what happened?...she was in the toilet throwing her guts up and bleeding internally from the throat!  When telling the manageress this, she was extremely rude and ignorant! I was utterly disgusted by her attitude. She sat there and denied that the food she had served us had nuts or coconut milk in them, her response ""you can take the food to a laboratory for tasting if you do not believe"" - are you kidding me?  My friend was ill that whole night and the rest of the day after.  The food was ok, nothing special. The curries were luminous, bright colours that looked like they had been poured straight out of a jar and heated up with some meat!  Overall, I would never come back here.

This time I came away with the impression that they had reheated the food from an industrial warehouse. The starters were tasty but I don’t think they were made on the premises. The main course, Tikki Massala was very disappointing. The sauce tasted like they used a 10 liter jar of tomato sauce and added a little bit of curry. The rice was not any more inspiring either. On the plus side, the service was very good and the yoghurt mango dessert was very tasty. It is unfortunate that the quality has slipped so much.

There were some good reviews as well as bad reviews. But we took the risk and visited this restaurant on a Sunday in April 2017. The two waiters with whom we had contact were very friendly. The Restaurant is clean, quiet and spacious. The ambient is good.   They offered only very few choices. They served papads with some dips free as an appetizer. Papad is a thin, crisp, round food from India. Sorry to say that it is a very cheap version of appetizer. I ordered Chicken Biriyani. Its origin is in India. It is a very tasty dish normally. If one has never tasted good Biriyani, he or she wouldn’t find the difference. The Biriyani which I got hasn’t tasted as it should be. My wife ordered Gobi Aloo and butter naan. Gobi Aloo is a cauliflower with potato preparation. It was very salty. We both suffered under very dry throat throughout the night and the next day. We think that the spices we had contained a quantity of Ajinomoto (Glutamate).",2017-04-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4707853-Reviews-or10-Swagat_Restaurante_Indio-Madrid.html,UID_1051,0.067,0.836,0.097,0.809,0.0917857142857143,0.6017460317460318,0.25226,1005,94,0.0935323383084577,0,27,False,36,0.1395348837209302,0.1395348837209302,0.2558139534883721,0.0697674418604651,0.1627906976744186,0.0232558139534883,0.0232558139534883,0.0465116279069767,0.0930232558139534,0.0465116279069767,184,125,4.456521739130435,0,0,visit madrid went review good review well bad review took risk visit restaur sunday april two waiter contact friendli restaur clean quiet spaciou ambient good offer choic serv papad dip free appet papad thin crisp round food india sorri say cheap version appet order chicken biriyani origin india tasti dish normal one never tast good biriyani find differ biriyani got tast wife order gobi aloo butter naan gobi aloo cauliflow potato prepar salti suffer dri throat throughout night next day think spice contain quantiti ajinomoto glutam,bad review,2

I recommend making a reservation, as we were lucky to get a tall table before the place filled up. In Madrid, this is probably one of the best brunches for your money. For 25 euros, we each had drinks (mimosas and a bloody mary), coffee, plus two dishes, which in the end was too much food for the two of us. I would especially recommend the salmon, bacon, and avacado eggs benedict which was delicious. Service was quick and friendly, and it is a great, cozy, neighborhood spot.

Spoilt for choice, Artemisia sol has a wide range of dishes and cuisines on offer. We all had a starter and main each so tried quite a range. The gazpacho was delicious, the vichyssoise very heavy on cream and the crepes the size of a main course, but tasty. As for mains, my son had a rice dish containing mushrooms and seaweed and it was, he said, the best rice dish he’s ever had. My veggie paella was meh, the stir fried wok dish with noodles, veggies and tofu, stodgy and seemed dumped on the plate. The pasta with pesto was tasty but it’s hard to mess that up and the veggie bolognese poor. There was pasta (nicely cooked) with almost no soya bolognese...it should have been the other way round in terms of proportions. The waitress and service was absolutely delightful. I’d recommend a meal here if you’re wanting veggie food but beware the portion sizes and lack of finesse.

We had been given a very nice table away from the big groups and long tables. We had chosen to go for the set menu (including starter-main-dessert) at the fixed price of 28 euro /person. As bit was my first experience with Peruvian food I wanted to try as many flavors as possible and set menu is a good way and value for money too.I cannot say I'm a big fun of ceviche but I ate it. Not bad but not the best dish of the night. Apart from this all the rest was very good including the three leches sweet in the end.

We picked the menu at 65Euro and that was the best and only decision we had to make. What followed was a parade of carefully curated dishes and we eventually lost count but think there were ten courses. We had razor clams,mussels, lobster, beef marrow and beef cheeks, lamb bow,scallops, fish, and these are just the ones I can remember. Each dish was art and food and had secret surprise flavours and textures that were delightful. Servings were more generous than usual tasting menus. Dessert at the end combined fruit and chocolate in a range of tastes. Chef is in the dining room for much of the evening and I suspect he takes personal pride in seeing how much we enjoyed the experience. This is a memorable meal and a highlight of the visit in Madrid.

Each time I picked the 5-course 50 euro menú degustación (tasting menu), with the wine pairings (about 20 euros). There was also a 65-euro 7-course tasting menu (which was supposed to show off the chef at his most unfettered) and, I believe, an a la carte option: I found the 5-course menú degustación quite varied and spectacular each time. On each of the three occasions the chef never repeated himself, although I began to notice famliar themes and combinations. So the dining experience was always at once reassuring and surprising. I know they also offer a 35-euro 3-course mid-day menú ejecutivo (executive three-course prix-fixe menu), in which they promise to give customers a taste of the chef´s range in 45 minutes (for those on a clock).  The chef, Yong Ping (who goes by Julio in Spain), is phenomenal: this, apparently, is his third restaurant and his most personal to date. He spent, I take it, 4 years in a Spanish restaurant in Pamplona, and this shows in his peculiarly successful wedding of culinary traditions. So-called fusion gastronomy can often degenerate into a pastiche or parody, a poorly improvised mish-mash of dishes from different traditions or else a rehash of all-too familiar themes. Yong Ping, in contrast, truly integrates ingredients, seasonings, and techniques from Spanish, Chinese, Andean, and even Thai or Japanese. He'll not just throw together ingredients or seasonings: he'll take a Spanish product, give it a Chinese treatment, and add an Andean, Thair or Japanese twist. And vice versa. Never just for its own sake or to show off but to bring out the strengths of whatever is in season together with the richest integration of flavors and textures: I say ""richest"" advisedly because this is not minimalist cooking. I don't mean it's heavy or over-abundant (it''s not): I mean rather that he aims for and achieves a rare complexity in flavor and texture that invariably works on the palate and deeply satisfies. He has a kind of perfect culinary pitch that way and I have found it fascinating to explore his latest creations whenever I am lucky enough to be in that great, impossible to overpraise city. Despite the aesthetic ambition, Yong Ping and his staff are the soul of warmth and earthiness: he likes to recommend he use our hands (e.g., for shellfish) because he says everything tastes better that way. I should add that in most recent visits (June 2018) the sumiller was a lively, knowledgeable, twinkle in his eye Madrilene man whose name is Raúl; he not only has a command of many of the most interesting unusual finds in the extraordinarily diversified and constantly innovating world of Spanish wine, he is extremely sensitive and responsive to customers (so the first night, when I said I didn't want so many wine pairings, he brought out 4 instead). The restaurant is well-lit, with a kind of contemporary, eclectic, laid-back chic decor, and a wait-staff that is attentive but never intrusive. A gem in a city chock-full of them.",2018-07-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12264336-Reviews-Soy_Kitchen-Madrid.html,UID_2056,0.007,0.859,0.134,0.9975,0.2270996603970741,0.4926724137931034,0.3410722222222222,3121,229,0.0733739186158282,0,113,False,80,0.1325301204819277,0.144578313253012,0.3132530120481928,0.0481927710843373,0.2289156626506024,0.0120481927710843,0.0120481927710843,0.0120481927710843,0.0843373493975903,0.0120481927710843,528,329,4.910984848484849,0,0,soy kitchen three time date first time june recent alon friend june time pick cours euro men degustaci n tast menu wine pair euro also euro cours tast menu suppos show chef unfett believ la cart option found cours men degustaci n quit vari spectacular time three occas chef never repeat although began notic famliar theme combin dine experi alway reassur surpris know also offer euro cours mid day men ejecutivo execut three cours prix fix menu promis give custom tast chef rang minut clock chef yong ping goe julio spain phenomen appar third restaur person date spent take year spanish restaur pamplona show peculiarli success wed culinari tradit call fusion gastronomi often degener pastich parodi poorli improvis mish mash dish differ tradit els rehash familiar theme yong ping contrast truli integr ingredi season techniqu spanish chines andean even thai japanes throw togeth ingredi season take spanish product give chines treatment add andean thair japanes twist vice versa never sake show bring strength whatev season togeth richest integr flavor textur say richest advisedli minimalist cook mean heavi abund mean rather aim achiev rare complex flavor textur invari work palat deepli satisfi kind perfect culinari pitch way found fascin explor latest creation whenev lucki enough great imposs overprais citi despit aesthet ambit yong ping staff soul warmth earthi like recommend use hand e g shellfish say everyth tast better way add recent visit june sumil live knowledg twinkl eye madrilen man whose name ra l command mani interest unusu find extraordinarili diversifi constantli innov world spanish wine extrem sensit respons custom first night said want mani wine pair brought instead restaur well lit kind contemporari eclect laid back chic decor wait staff attent never intrus gem citi chock full,very good review,5

A dark man came out smiling and launched into a stream of Spanish we could not keep up with. We looked at each other. He asked us where we were from, in English. We told him. ""Ah Australia. I live upstairs with two people, two girls. One, she is Australian."" We talked some more. When he spoke, he looked only at Susannah. I couldn't get sore; she was beautiful after all. I didn't blame him.  Susannah asked if they did vegetarian food and he said yes and he invited us in. We went in.

I remember the first time I visited; My friends and I had just gotten to Madrid, and were waiting to move into our hotel. Within minutes, we had sent down our suitcases, and the Bartender and Owner handed us some delicious Gin and Tonics made with Spanish Gin, and asked us about where we were from, where we were staying, what we wanted to see while we were here, etc.. He was so nice to us, and he really helped us feel welcome in Madrid, and even tried to give us some Spanish lessons. We spent hours there, talking, and enjoying his company. The drinks are hand crafted, and are artful in ingredients and taste. They have about every kind of Gin you could possibly imagine, each one better than the last. The food is absolutely to die-for, and is perfect in flavor, quality, and value. I still have dreams about the Caramelized Onion Tortilla.... I cannot recommend this bar enough. Even if you are not a Gin kind of person, it is still worth a visit. Every-time I have stopped in, the entire place is packed full of happy people enjoying each-other's company.

A friend of ours who is an historian who specializes in Andean studies had recommended it as the best Peruvian food in Madrid and my husband who is from Ecuador was dying to go. It completely lived up to expectations. Because we were with a group, we tried several things on the menu and enjoyed them all! The papas rellenas (mashed potato stuffed with meat, olives, raisins and egg then fried) were fabulous as were the tamales and the anticuchos (skewers of marinated grilled steak). For entrees we had the tacu tacu (a rice and beans with seafood), the chichirones de chancho (fried pieces of pork) the gallina, (chicken in sauce) and the pollo norteño (another chicken) and the gallo en aji (capon in hot sauce). Almost all of it was excellent (although the one fault was that the chichirones were a little fattier than I'd like).  They also make excellent pisco sours, terrific alfajores (cookies with dulce de leche) and tremendously delicious suspiroes (dulce de leche topped with merengue).

I gave this place a try as there is a large Peruvian community in Spain, so I figured you will get good authentic food. As soon as you sit down, you get a Papá Huancaina, a tiny portion of a potato with a creamy spicy cheese sauce. Great start! Moving on to a drink and appetizer, you can't go wrong with a pisco sour and the ceviche. The pisco was generous, prepared on the spot with proper egg whites. The ceviche mixto has Mediterranean sea bass, prawns and octopus presented beautifully with crunchy corn in a perfectly balanced lime juice. At €15, it's not the cheapest option but it the portion is very generous. You could have this as a main easily or share it between two people. I was excited for the main course. I ordered the Aji de Gallina which is a chicken stew in a nutty, spicy creamy sauce served with white rice. The dish is simple but the presentation was poor, so different to the appetizer! I'm not sure what happened but as you can see in the picture, it looked like they slapped the food on the dish and kicked it out of the kitchen. Flavour wise, it was OK. The sauce is thick, bit on the heavy side with no real kick to it. I ended the night with a decadent ""tres leches"" cake which was a relief. Well presented, creamy and flavourful. The whipped cream was light and not overly sweet since the cake itself is already pretty sweet.  All in all, good food with some letdowns, and to leave a sour taste at the end of the night, they didn't take Amex which is ridiculous considering they cater mainly to tourists! Total bill came out to €42 ",2017-02-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3971140-Reviews-or20-Inti_de_Oro_Barrio_de_Las_Letras-Madrid.html,UID_7232,0.046,0.798,0.155,0.9901,0.1532153032153032,0.5576109076109076,0.3846105263157894,1697,157,0.0925162050677666,3,42,False,46,0.1145833333333333,0.1770833333333333,0.3020833333333333,0.0729166666666666,0.1875,0.0208333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.0104166666666666,0.0625,0.0104166666666666,320,195,4.3,0,0,varieti restaur found street inti imagin competit term food price gave place tri larg peruvian commun spain figur get good authent food soon sit get pap huancaina tini portion potato creami spici chees sauc great start move drink appet go wrong pisco sour cevich pisco gener prepar spot proper egg white cevich mixto mediterranean sea bass prawn octopu present beauti crunchi corn perfectli balanc lime juic cheapest option portion gener could main easili share two peopl excit main cours order aji de gallina chicken stew nutti spici creami sauc serv white rice dish simpl present poor differ appet sure happen see pictur look like slap food dish kick kitchen flavour wise ok sauc thick bit heavi side real kick end night decad tre lech cake relief well present creami flavour whip cream light overli sweet sinc cake alreadi pretti sweet good food letdown leav sour tast end night take amex ridicul consid cater mainli tourist total bill came,average review,3

This restaurant is tiny. 10' wide, only half dozen tables. That's not a bad thing. Adds to the experience  When you get to the door, it's easy to think there is another entry, as people are eating right there and no greeting station. PUSH the door (my daughter had to figure it out for us. We waived in the next family that was equally confused)  No food for kids. Half the tables included kids. My daughter is a fussy six year old. My suggestion is to have something available (even off menu like chicken and rice.. Or have some gourmet mac n cheese ).  The bread is 2/pp extra. Advice to the restaurant... Add 2 to every entree and make the bread free  Most entrees were 17. I tried to order the 29 tasting menu. Btw.. 1 hour after open on a Friday night. The waitress said they didn't have it. Really disappointed, as we were looking for an experience. No explanation why. Suggest taking it off the menu (it's just a printed one sided paper)  To sum it up, less than a five star experience... But the food was so good, I didn't want to bring down their score  Shoot me a message if you have any questions.

When we arrived, I saw this place was empty and quickly had second thoughts but most of the comments on trip advisor experienced the same first impression but they urge to stay and eat. I took their advice. I have one word to describe the chef: genius.  The food is absolutely incredible. The duck was ridiculously delicious but so is pretty much everything on the menu. It is impossible to pick a favorite dish. Usually, most chefs hide behind the quality of their products yet they lack creativity and a deeper understanding of food. This chef is not one of those chefs. Not only creative but the balance you taste in his foods makes for a very satisfying experience. It's been a long time since I've had a satisfying experience in a restaurant where my taste buds aren't overwhelmed by combinations. This chef is a genius.  Let me put it in football terms: he isn't at Messi's level yet but he's definitely Dybala. He's on his way to something big.  This place is a MUST GO.

It is very popular with locals (only open from 13.30 to 15.00 for lunch and was completely full by 14.oo on a Thurs plus evenings most nights). and we were the only tourists that day. There was a 3 course set menu with many choices as well as the usual a la carte. We had for example a bowl of creamy vege soup and a plate of wonderful hors d'horeves which included houmus, puree carrot and beetroot with grated carrot and sprouted aduki beans. With warm rustic bread this was welcome change from the usual lack of fresh veg or salad in the meals we experienced in Madrid.

However, both service and food is not completely great. There are some items which are quite good, some other have less quality. For instance, pizza is, in my opinion, too thick and lacks ""something"" on top. Meat has been irregularly prepared, sometimes very good, sometimes below par. One of the things I do not like is that sometimes the meat is not cook as per order. Service is sometimes also an issue, always gentle, but being such a large restaurant they forget about some things from time to time.

I was invited to this Uruguayan owned restaurant and had a nice dinner with UY's style barbecue and pizza. Pizza was really good and very similar to the one we get at home and it was well stuffed and had fresh ingredients. Pablo, the owner, shared with us that his 2nd restaurant was closed to ensure he was able to serve and handle the quality he aims, with multiple places and different direction style he was not being able to do so. The food is similar to the one you can get in UY, some interesting facts about our visit. - FAINÁ (which is flatbread or crust made with chickpea flour) was very good, large serving and cheaper than in Uruguay!!! EUR 3.70 while in UY is about UYU70 pesos for half size portion. - BBQ for two, it was EUR 52, it included MORCILLA (black pudding) and chorizo (sausage), MORCILLA like made in UY is impossible to get anywhere else, we have sweet and salty one, the ones I’ve tried around always have a ""cumin"" taste. This was significantly more expensive than in UY, it’s understandable as the meat quality and price is higher here. The restaurant includes white table setting and it has an upscale look and feel, it's not like the ones you can get this kind of food in UY, but if you're in Spain and you're interested to see our pizza and FAINÁ style, definitely you have to visit this place. I have not done BBQ anywhere else in Spain, so can't compare and tell if there are any better places for this or not, it was similar to ours, but not just like ours. Also, they serve Picaña, which is usually referred to as the rump cover or rump cap in the US. Also, as main difference the fat is not removed from the cut until the steak has been cooked or just served with it, some people like to eat this some others like me not, i would even prefer to get it cooked without fat, but in most ""parrillas"" this is not possible as they have some cuts that take long already pre-cooked or slightly grilled.

From the start, you are greeted warmly inside a intimate Bistro and then walked through the menu by a charming chef who is clearly passionate about what he does. And boy does it show in the food, the empanadas, steak & fish are all highlights, the passion fruit meringue to finish was maybe even the best dish we had. We booked online and saved 30% but would've happily paid full price, or more, it really was that good! The photos don't do it justice, the steak was cooked to perfection and served with a lovely selection of vegetables that didn't overpower it. The fish was lovely and unusual, it was fish of the day so likely to change but will be up to the great standard of the bistro without a doubt.

Had the choice of sitting and offered to choose a wine when I couldn't decide. Chef came out to explain the menu as it was in Spanish and I went for the pate special starter and the Argentinian cut of meat for main. Pate was delicious. Not sure what I liked most. Homemade chutney, nut crust, pate or the dusting of cocoa powder. The main came out smelling amazing. Cooked as per the chef's preference which was almost rare but perfect. The blackened crust of pepper and salt made the meal enhanced by the baby onions and slice of turnip, which I don't normally like.

The restaurant's interior is much smaller than we had anticipated, but quite comfortable, especially along the wall opposite the bathrooms. Reservations are recommended. There is also outdoor seating opposite the entrance, though it wasn't immediately obvious to us that it was part of Oyamel. The guacamole was indeed spectacular...possibly the best we have ever had. The dish was quite small however, and we think would better serve as an appetizer for one person than two. Likewise, the mojitos were excellent, but a bit skimpy once the mint and ice were accounted for.

It’s always nice to go in t9 a restaurant abroad and be able to take pot luck and know you can eat what you order- that said, this didn’t happen as they have a English menu anyway. We had the vegetable croquettes which were very nice and then for the main, we had one of their tasting plates- what a good idea, more places should do this and Artemisa did 4. We went for the number 3 plate which was mousakka, quinoa cous cous with honey, cinnamon and caramelised grilled vegetables with goat cheese, mushrooms crêpes and tofu sticks with Teriyaki sauce. It was all very tasty, the tofu was very well cocked which not everyone can do, the mousakka was lovely but the star of the show, and I was contemplating not getting the number 3 plate, was the cous cous, which I am generally not a fan of.

Anyone reading these reviews is given the impression that this is an eat-in pizzeria with basic but comfortable tables and chairs and hopefully a wine list of sorts.  The 4 rage reviews (plus one dissenter) of Pizzeria El Trebol is symptomatic of this problem. The over-enthusiastic descriptions ""best pizza in Spain"", ""best pizza I have ever eaten"" and even ""best pizza ever, including New York"" should all be taken with a large pinch of salt. Why? Because not one of these rave reviewers bothers to mention the crucial fact that this is not a sit-in restaurant at all - it is a very tiny ""hole-in-the-wall"" takeaway with just one tiny table and a very narrow shelf (20cm deep if that) along the wall (cannot be more than 2m) with a couple of stools.  After tramping miles looking for this place I quickly retreated in great disappointment as soon as I saw what it really was, so I cannot verify whether or not this is a great pizza but if these are the opinions of the ultra-budget conscious then I would be very dubious.",2010-08-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1014172-Reviews-or60-Pizzeria_El_Trebol-Madrid.html,UID_36477,0.085,0.766,0.149,0.9646,0.2280826118326118,0.5128382034632034,0.9508166666666668,1337,113,0.0845175766641735,0,38,False,35,0.0,0.0681818181818181,0.1590909090909091,0.0454545454545454,0.1818181818181818,0.1136363636363636,0.1136363636363636,0.0681818181818181,0.2045454545454545,0.0454545454545454,233,154,4.7296137339055795,0,0,tripadvisor advertis review trust might possibl true hotel come restaur increasingli frustrat unjustifi rave review assum student budget back packer differ order prioriti anyon read review given impress eat pizzeria basic comfort tabl chair hope wine list sort rage review plu one dissent pizzeria el trebol symptomat problem enthusiast descript best pizza spain best pizza ever eaten even best pizza ever includ new york taken larg pinch salt one rave review bother mention crucial fact sit restaur tini hole wall takeaway one tini tabl narrow shelf cm deep along wall cannot coupl stool tramp mile look place quickli retreat great disappoint soon saw realli cannot verifi whether great pizza opinion ultra budget consciou would dubiou,bad review,2

And there are...quite a few in fact. And Artemisa is by far one of the best. After reading reviews this was the first place we stopped for food after arriving in Madrid and it did not dissapoint! We arrived during the lunch period so we both opted for the set lunch menu - a starter, a main,  desert and wine. All for around 12 euros each! Starters included salads, soups, bread etc... all fresh ingredients and unique tasting vegan/veggie dishes. Main course varied each day, and you would get a choice on that day of three or four things that were available. During our stay we visited several times for lunch, but my favorite dish had to be the Vegan lasagne, closely followed by the vegan paella. Deserts included fruit platters, vegan tarts, cheesecakes, chocolate deserts, a huge variety! Vegan custard cake is the one to go for though :) We were told we could have a glass of wine included with our meal, however our waitress just left a full bottle on the table for us to help ourselves. Which leads me on to my final point: excellent service! Although there was a language barrier and the staff were quite clearly rushed off their feet, the service was a delight. Other things to note - Free wifi,  available. There are no set dinner menus so three course meal will be considerably more if visiting in the evening (I highly recommend going for lunch). Closes around 4pm-ish and reopens around 9pm. There is another Artemisa restaurant a short walk away, both do exceptional food but I recommend this one for the ultimate vegan dining experience.",2016-11-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697414-Reviews-or40-Artemisa_Sol_Huertas-Madrid.html,UID_19331,0.018,0.849,0.134,0.9921,0.2689583333333333,0.5701785714285715,0.32026875,1725,134,0.0776811594202898,4,51,False,77,0.0681818181818181,0.1363636363636363,0.4090909090909091,0.0227272727272727,0.1818181818181818,0.0454545454545454,0.0227272727272727,0.0227272727272727,0.0454545454545454,0.0454545454545454,305,208,4.6524590163934425,0,0,vegan walk madrid past meat pig leg display everi window wonder decent place plant base food citi quit fact artemisa far one best read review first place stop food arriv madrid dissapoint arriv lunch period opt set lunch menu starter main desert wine around euro starter includ salad soup bread etc fresh ingredi uniqu tast vegan veggi dish main cours vari day would get choic day three four thing avail stay visit sever time lunch favorit dish vegan lasagn close follow vegan paella desert includ fruit platter vegan tart cheesecak chocol desert huge varieti vegan custard cake one go though told could glass wine includ meal howev waitress left full bottl tabl us help lead final point excel servic although languag barrier staff quit clearli rush feet servic delight thing note free wifi avail set dinner menu three cours meal consider visit even highli recommend go lunch close around pm ish reopen around pm anoth artemisa restaur short walk away except food recommend one ultim vegan dine experi,very good review,5

I was so happy to see that EVERYTHING on this restaurant's menu is gluten free (as well as vegetarian)!  They can also do anything on the menu to take away, which I opted for as I was tired from a long day of meetings and I liked the idea of having a lovely meal in the hotel room, watching some local tv.  The portion sizes are very big, so the waiter recommended to order just a main, and dessert if I felt like it. I opted for some grilled aubergine with cheese, which was so nice and definitely very filling!  I ordered a glass of wine while I waited for the food to be ready, and the waiter brought me some complimentary corn chips with homemade dip, which was wonderful and quite a big bowl!  The highlight, I must say, was the tiramisu. Having a wheat intolerance means I don't get to try desserts very often, and this tiramisu was, again, a very portion and amazing - I think it's one of the best I've tried (even from before I got my wheat intolerance!). And btw, if you do take away (as I did) you get a discount on the total bill! It was a yummy, filling, comforting and very affordable meal. I will definitely come back and I recommend Artemisa to anyone (not just to GF or vegetarians as the food and service was great).

Ive gone 3 or 4 times and food has been consistently fresh, tasty and leaves you satisfied. Being vegetarian, I felt the only thing that stopped me giving them a 5* is the fact that there is a lack of main dishes for vegetarians, but eating their starters does fill you up.

So it was with relief that we sat down at our table in Artemisa. The ambiance was wholesome and simple and the waiter was friendly and helpful - in fact he advised us not to order as much as we were going to, and he was right. The portions are large and excellent value. My partner and I ended up sharing three dishes: crepes filled with brie and mushrooms for a starter - big enough for a main course! - then a salad (which turned out to be sweet, so would have been better at the end of the meal) and finally a veggie paella. The restaurant also caters for the gluten-intolerant, which may have explained the less-than-perfect crepes. The paella was a bit salty and uninspired. The salad however was truly heavenly - a huge platter of a variety of fruits, perfectly ripe, with a delicious mango mousse in the middle. The wine was OK and very cheap.

During 1.5 days in Madrid, we went to this place 3 times (most of the main meals). If we could, we would pack some of the meals for our trip back. We also met the chef Manuel, who was down to earth and friendly. He welcomed us and also guided on through the menu (we don't speak Spanish). The meals were unique and delicious (we have traveled quite a bit). The deserts were some of the best we have had. The coffee cake is what I would recommend along with the vitamin juice. The meal combinations were a great way to sample different meals.

I have become an expert in empanadas since I have many Argentinian friends that they often cook empanadas for dinners at home and some are very good and some others not, but over the years I have learnt so much about them. I also visited Argentina some years ago and I did a master of empanadas. I am very reluctant to taste some empanadas, for example the ones at Mercado San Miguel. They are not attractive and I do not want to wast my time, but I found Pizzeria Argentina El Trébol and probably because of its name I was lucky and I tried very good homemade empanadas that were cooked in front of me.

Plus, were were pretty hungry when we got here. The waiter was just this side of sassy, but he was prompt with the food and was very helpful with recommendations. The restaurant was near our hotel in the Gran Via so that was very convenient. Ask for an English menu if you have trouble with the Spanish. They have one and we found it very helpful. We ordered the veggie lasagna, pizza with brie and goat cheese, mousaka (eggplant based dish) and spinach cannelloni. They were all hearty and delicious. The meal included bread, which was very good, but we had to buy water since in Spain they don't bring free water to the table. We ate after 9 pm on a Thursday night and it wasn't crowded at all.

We ordered a starter which was pretty nice served with tzatziki, which arrived pretty promptly. This was large enough for two people. This was nearly as good as the one we had in Athens, a few days before. However, it could have been served with more salad! The main arrived and I was horrified at the sight of it. I stupidly thought it may taste better. How wrong we both were. We ordrered the Artemisa I, which consisted of 4/5 different things. Don't bother. The spinach was wilted with pinenuts and it was dressed in a milky vile cheesey type sauce. Absolutely vile!. The paella was bland, tasted curried and contained courgettes, cauliflower and it tasted wrong, needed to be binned too! The moussaka tasted the best from the lot, not difficult considered how awful the majority of it was. It was dry and bland and needed more sauce. The courgette balls tasted curried and weren't too unpleasant, they needed a sauce to go with them too. How could I nearly forget the bland and flavourless vegetable burger. No idea what it was made of, the taste was totally forgettable. Perhaps this restaurant caters for the the Spanish market, however, t it did nothing for me or my partner. We ordered coffee and cake, as we had an unpleasant after taste in our mouths, and worse this taste still lingered in the morning after. Avoid this restaurant like the plague, unless you enjoy being a glutton for awful food. Go to Lamucca de Prado or Indian Aroma next door. (Yummy food at both places). I have no idea how the reviews below gave them such high scores. I would refuse to eat, even if someone paid me.",2011-07-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697414-Reviews-or120-Artemisa_Sol_Huertas-Madrid.html,UID_36543,0.128,0.772,0.1,-0.8741,-0.0272268907563025,0.6500560224089637,0.49565,1664,141,0.0847355769230769,3,47,False,53,0.0769230769230769,0.1076923076923077,0.1692307692307692,0.0153846153846153,0.1076923076923077,0.0307692307692307,0.0769230769230769,0.0923076923076923,0.2307692307692307,0.0923076923076923,298,187,4.587248322147651,0,0,went restaur read review order starter pretti nice serv tzatziki arriv pretti promptli larg enough two peopl nearli good one athen day howev could serv salad main arriv horrifi sight stupidli thought may tast better wrong ordrer artemisa consist differ thing bother spinach wilt pinenut dress milki vile cheesey type sauc absolut vile paella bland tast curri contain courgett cauliflow tast wrong need bin moussaka tast best lot difficult consid aw major dri bland need sauc courgett ball tast curri unpleas need sauc go could nearli forget bland flavourless veget burger idea made tast total forgett perhap restaur cater spanish market howev noth partner order coffe cake unpleas tast mouth wors tast still linger morn avoid restaur like plagu unless enjoy glutton aw food go lamucca de prado indian aroma next door yummi food place idea review gave high score would refus eat even someon paid,very bad review,1

We chose Artemisa because although we are meat/fish eaters we thought it would make for some interesting flavours. It was good although very quiet, possibly because it was a Monday night.

She was quite right as we shared one starter and had a main selection course which was for sharing. That was plenty of food and we are not small portion people.

Vegetarian restaurants in Madrid are rather scanty, so being vegetarians my wife and I were happy to have found one. Our first impression of the place was a little disappointing. The ambiance was rather prosaic. The restaurant consisted of a single rather long rectangular room with two rows of tables, those for two on the right, those for four on the left. The food, however, was of good quality and obviously attention had been paid to its appearance on the plate. To Madrilenian standards, the prices seemed reasonable.

We had a tasting menu for 2 (25,90 € VAT not included): moussaka, cous cous, escalibata with goat cheese, mushroom crepes and tofu sticks.

Not a good idea if you are not having dinner with a close person. Furthermore we were charged for the unrequested bread brought to the table.

I had there the best lasagnas ever, and the portion was absolutely huge! My husband took something ""greek"", not sure exactly of the name but it also came in huge proportions, so thank you!  My son drank a freshly pressed apple juice and it was fantastic (I admit I drank a bit of it too ;)). It add foam on top and was more like drinking an apple than just the average apple juice with sugar added. Just too good! I wish I knew how it was made. There is a down point which is that we, without notice, had to pay the bread they kept on the table. I'm not sure if it's a common thing done in Madrid or Spain though. We ate a part of it mostly while waiting for our main dish because we were just so hungry. Another down point is that we asked for tap water to save some money and our waitress who spoke perfect English (she probably was from UK according to her accent!) so I don't think she misunderstood but she served us a couple of bottles of water. I hate when that happens! I wish I had been brave enough to ask her to bring back the bottles and get us tap water but I wasn't.

Having dined at Brazillian restaurants not only in Rio and Sao Paulo, but also in other countries, I can honestly say that this has got to be the worst Churrascaria on this plant. The meats served were either leather or raw! Nothing in between! The leather ones needed a hacksaw to cut through them and the raw ones were basically raw meat thrown on a hot grill for a few seconds to brown it on the outside! The inside was cold and very bloody! The staff had absolutely no idea on what this style of food should be like and the entire evening was ruined .......

Wish we had eaten here when we first got to Madrid and not on our last night.  Staff were polite and attentive. Spoke to us in English and apologised for not being better at speaking English. The fault is ours as we don’t speak Spanish.  The concept is great. It’s a set priced menu and you have a buffet type meal (salad, rice, potatoes, cous cous, tomatoes etc etc). Then a waiter comes round with various meats and cuts it off the skewer for you at the table. We had around 5/6 different meats and had the amazing grilled pineapple.  You have a small card which you leave on the green side for more meat or the red side for no more meat although the guys come round even when your card is red if it’s a type of meat you haven’t tried yet (great service in my eyes).  We shared a desert as we were so full and it was great.  Drinks are good too.  Like I say I wish we had found this gem a few nights ago.  Thank you and well recommended.

So much so that I was compelled to write my first review for this little gem.  I booked dinner going for the full rodizio option. We arrived early but this was no problem, we were welcomed very courteously by the staff. We were asked if we'd been to a rodizio before and the waiter patiently and comprehensively explained to us how it works.  We weren't sure about what wines to go for, and again without any hesitation the waiter went above and beyond and brought two bottles for us to try. On to the rodizio itself, firstly we started by getting our salads from the extensive buffet.  Here I would have preferred if the various options were described in a bit more detail as for most we just had to guess what they were. I guess in a way it helps to push you to try new dishes.  After a bit of snacking on the various buffet selections, the chef came over with the first meat serving. He was a very charming and sociable guy; even if he didn't speak english we had no issues getting served.  The quality of meat was absolutely fantastic, we both enjoyed the numerous cuts very much and it was clear this place did not cut any corners with their meat.  The meats were on a rotation so we sampled all of the options. At the end we were also served roasted pineapple with cinnamon which was also fantastic and obviously we had to ask for another portion which was promptly brought over.  The venue was clean, nicely decorated and the music selection was also very appropriate.    All in all it was one of the best decisions we made in our trip to have dinner here and if returning to Madrid, I will definitely come back here.  Keep up the good work!

On a lovely little side street, this really cozy little place is a must. It’s not as swanky as some other places we tried but we thought it was the best for breakfast. And had the best churros and porras (think fatter churros!) than anywhere we went. Same with the chocolate which was thick and not too sweet.

The owner is a really nice and always caring French woman with magic fingers making one of the best- if not the best- cakes, biscuits and other sweets I have ever eaten in my entire life! As it is a french café you of course can breakfast croissants and crepes. Also just delicious. The best about this place though is, that its not expensive at all. I´m not saying its super cheap, but absolutely affordable for students. As I am one I can tell. When I discovered this cute little place with two spanish friends we instantly fell in love with its heartily welcoming owner, the delicious offer, the calm atmosphere and the touch of France, as you can hear french radio and in the back of the café find a picture of the Eiffel Tour on the wall. The Chocolate Fondue- Oh my God!!!!!! You really need to go there! - I tried that day and all the other things we ordered made us call the place ""El cielo"" which translated means ""heaven"". Just to give you an example of HOW good it actually was! ;)  To cut it short now, if you want to visit a really nice, cheap and absolutely delicious café in Madrid- for breakfast, coffee time or whatsoever- got to ""El Bocado de Carole""!

You can tell the ingredients are FRESH and a good percent of them are ORGANIC . That's something to shout out. The house wine I ordered was absolutely delicious as well. The BREAD was very artisan and we loved the taste. I think the fresh organic ingredients worth the maybe slightly higher price tag on some of the dishes. I would not say it was overpriced. For STARTER I ordered vegetable croquettes -they were really filling and delicious. My partner ordered nachos with guacamole. I don't particularly like guacamole but this was really nice! Plus point.  HOWEVER!- we both felt a bit disappointed by the lack of imagination on the menu. Most of the dishes had almost exactly the same ingredients!! As my boyfriend does not eat eggplants and courgette it was actually challenging to find a main course for him. Even I had an issue ordering something interesting . In the end we ordered a sharing platter. It had a vegetable paella that was okey, the above mentioned nice croquettes, some ratatouille like dish which was nice enough but overall a bit too average and eggplants and something else I cannot recall . Overall it was a bit boring. Without the starters I would have gone hungry. I would like to point out that WE ARE NOT vegetarian. I think if you are, or if you are after genuine, fresh , healthy food :this could be the place for you. Just do not put your hopes up about the variety.

At 20,30 the restaurant was still empty, which is normal in Spain. Although I speak Spanish a bit I asked for the English menu. The girl at the reception was very gentle but absolutely disinterested in her job. She stayed all the time chatting on her phone. I decided to order a vegan salad, which was a mixture of different vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, sweetcorn, green salad, olives, carrots, barbabietolas. The dish was big and good. As entrée I ordered the vegetarian wok: soy noodles with fried vegetables. This was a bit disappointing as the ingredients seemed not to be cooked at the same time. It was this mountain of needles and vegetables on top but the fry flavour was too strong and I didn't like it much. I drank a small bottled beer. All for 31 euros.

The waiter recommended an excellent Ribera del Duero wine, namely the Alonso del Yerro 2008. For our first course we split the pulpo a la brasa (grilled octopus) which was beautifully presented and delicious. Next we split the ""T bone de Ternera"" (Veal T-bone steak) which was cooked exactly to our liking and seasoned perfectly with a light amount of salt. What for us keeps this restaurant from achieving Michelin Star status is the service level. At a fine dining restaurant the bread crumbs on the table should be promptly swept off the table by the waiter, and in the present case they were not, at least not until the end of the meal. Also, after the first glasses of wine and bottled water were poured by the waiter, we had to pour our own the rest of the evening.

We've had some great food here, but for the most part the service has not been something to write home about. We were accordingly pleasantly surprised by the warmth and good cheer of the staff at this small, budget eatery. What nice people! Food-wise, this isn't the best we'd had, nor the worst. Simple fare prepared in a workman-like way, I would describe it. Wine: above-average, but you get only a glass with the menu del dia, not the typical bottle or decanter. The included dessert--a tart with dark chocolate sauce--was perhaps the highlight of the meal, which came in at a comfortable 9.50 euros. We were then offered coffee, which came with a complimentary sweet, which we picked from a basket the waiter brought to our table, again with the best of cheer and perfect courtesy.

I have been to Sylkar, El Meson de la Tortilla de Gabino, Juana la Loca, and Bodega de La Ardosa, and Cerveriz and tried their regular tortilla de patata. This was probably my 2nd favorite tortilla de patata that I tried. It was so rich and delicious with just the right amount of salt. From what I understood from our waiter (someone correct me if I'm wrong), their regular tortilla uses only egg yolks, which would explain why it was so creamy and rich. The potatoes were just right and there are no onions in this one, giving it a pure egg and potato taste. This was a tortilla that you have to share with someone, as this restaurant does not serve tapa/pincho style slices and you have to buy a whole (but small) tortilla instead, so it's not recommendable to come here alone. It's also important to note that this was the most expensive tortilla on my list, coming in at almost ten euros for one to share.",2016-04-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d788419-Reviews-or30-Las_Tortillas_de_Gabino-Madrid.html,UID_25727,0.034,0.868,0.098,0.9085,0.2045112781954887,0.5486986697513012,0.4657,1053,106,0.100664767331434,0,26,False,20,0.1071428571428571,0.1428571428571428,0.3214285714285714,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428571428571428,0.0,196,131,4.377551020408164,0,0,mission find best tortilla de patata madrid provid unbias review bar restaur serv sylkar el meson de la tortilla de gabino juana la loca bodega de la ardosa cerveriz tri regular tortilla de patata probabl nd favorit tortilla de patata tri rich delici right amount salt understood waiter someon correct wrong regular tortilla use egg yolk would explain creami rich potato right onion one give pure egg potato tast tortilla share someon restaur serv tapa pincho style slice buy whole small tortilla instead recommend come alon also import note expens tortilla list come almost ten euro one share,good review,4

The food is delicious - they have a selection of starters, tortills and then fish and meats. We had a few dishes from each section all of which excelled. The chef owner trained in London and spent lots of time taking us through the menu in english as none of us spoke decent Spanish; he made a number of recommendations (including when to stop ordering!). We started with a rose Moet (44 euro); most wines on the menu are Spanish of course and very reasonably priced (the most expensive was 12 euro). The ham croquettes, jamon itself and the traditional and truffle tortillas were all delicious. Could not recommend this spot more.

While we had spent a month in Barcelona, many of the items on this menu were new to us. Going with two couples had the great advantage that, if you decide, as we did , to share dishes, you get to taste more items. We had three appetizers and two main dishes, one fish and one meat. . The three appetizers we had were: croquetas de boletus (mushroom), ensaladilla russa con cigalas (baby lobster potato salad), and tortilla de espinatas con gambas (spinach and shrimp). . (NOTE: a Spanish tortilla is not a flour or corn crepe but more like a quiche or omelet.) The, two main dishes were delicias de merluza rebozadas (like a breaded haddock), and presa Iberico a la plancha (a grilled shoulder cut of pork). To finish off, we split two desserts:. helado de yogur con crema de higos naturales (yogurt with “natural” fig sauce and ice cream) and torrija con helado de limon (like a milky french toast with a sugary crème brulee crust). I loved everything but the mushroom croquettes (though my wife was a lot more positive about those), but I especially enjoyed the lobster potato salad, the melt in your mouth merluza, whose super light breading was as unlike American style fish sticks as it is possible to get, and the pork dish. Indeed, the lobster potato salad was, perhaps not surprisingly, the best potato salad I’ve ever eaten. The ambiance at this place was elegant without being pretentious, and the service was excellent. Because we had shared dishes, the bill came to well under 30 euros per person and we walked away very filled without having overeaten. Moreover, we could actually talk to each other rather than being blasted by American inspired pop music as in too many places. And we spent 2 hours over lunch without ever feeling rushed. My wife and I really hope to eat here again when we are next in Madrid. P.S.

We tried to look at them menu on-line but it is in Spanish only. When we sat down, we ordered a bottle if wine and asked if there may be an English version of the menu. With none available, we struggled a little to understand all the dishes until our waiter asked us how hungry we were and if he could go ahead and put together a dinner for us. He assured us, that if we were served something that was not to our liking he would replace it. We said ""Muy Bueno"" and let the games begin. The food came out at a good pace and each item was very tasty and presented beautifully. In some cases, the food was served from the cooking pan right to our plate at the table by several different servers coming out of the kitchen. Everything was wonderful and absolutely delicious. We had two small intro appetizers that were very good(julienned green bean dish and second, a Foie Gras Bon-Bon). Great start. Later plates included: Tortilla Valazquena(Potato) , Presa Iberica (Pork). Each of the plates for two were served perfectly and were sized appropriately. Two delicious desserts: Tartar de Frutas con arroz con leche(chilled rice pudding over finely chopped fruits) and a Postre Goloso De Chocolate (Choc Ice cream floating a frothy warm choc mousse). The staff was very attentive and helpful. Quality vs. value was extremely high. We drank two 12 year old bottles of wine and had all this great food for around 100 euros.

One of the maitres is a wine expert, ask him, is recommendations have always been great and not expensive. Dish presentation is nice. The omelettes are the main dish so the menu is divided in before and after the omelettes. Before you will find fried anchovies with a twist, octopus, razor shells/clams with a sauce and the star: the marrow served with a cream and caramelized with a small kitchen blowtorch. Omelettes are great in all fashions, for us the truffle omelette is king. The omelette style is a little bit undercooked (not a failure, that is the style). After the omelettes you find the usual meats, fish (we never get there...). Deserts are also nice specially the ""torrija"" (a kind of french toast).",2016-04-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d788419-Reviews-or20-Las_Tortillas_de_Gabino-Madrid.html,UID_10200,0.006,0.833,0.161,0.9837,0.2302891156462585,0.5839569160997733,0.3163416666666666,992,77,0.0776209677419354,0,33,False,34,0.0588235294117647,0.1470588235294117,0.3529411764705882,0.0294117647058823,0.1764705882352941,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0588235294117647,0.088235294117647,0.0294117647058823,173,117,4.7398843930635834,0,0,ambienc cozi modern wood expos brick servic attent tabl central leg problem join coupl larg group tablewar nice glass special wine cup thick extens well select wine list one maitr wine expert ask recommend alway great expens dish present nice omelett main dish menu divid omelett find fri anchovi twist octopu razor shell clam sauc star marrow serv cream caramel small kitchen blowtorch omelett great fashion us truffl omelett king omelett style littl bit undercook failur style omelett find usual meat fish never get desert also nice special torrija kind french toast,average review,3

Hands down, the best Spanish-style hot chocolate I've ever had (after 5 trips to that country). The churros were fresh and hot, but what really got our attention are these pastries called Lazos. I think they are the best pastry I've eaten - soft and sweet and moist and delicious. The coffee was good too. They offer some more substantial items like bocadillos, but I didn't try them. The service was excellent (and easy on the eyes, too).",2017-10-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1788549-Reviews-or70-Chocolat-Madrid.html,UID_36686,0.0,0.684,0.316,0.9921,0.4986928104575163,0.6071895424836602,0.3614571428571428,574,45,0.078397212543554,0,22,False,20,0.1470588235294117,0.2352941176470588,0.3235294117647059,0.088235294117647,0.1470588235294117,0.0588235294117647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,104,85,4.528846153846154,0,0,tini cafe beauti neighborhood prado plaza mayor ate twice two day good hand best spanish style hot chocol ever trip countri churro fresh hot realli got attent pastri call lazo think best pastri eaten soft sweet moist delici coffe good offer substanti item like bocadillo tri servic excel easi eye,good review,4

One tortilla is more than enough for two people and is incredibly filling. Usually to be accompanied by delicious beef tomatoes dressed in parmesan and balsalmic vinegar. They also have amazing croquetas, some of the best I have savoured here in Madrid. I have yet to try the other dishes on the menu but this restaurant is usually busy and filled with well to do families or business men. Prices are a little steep for food but it is definitely worth it! A tortilla starts at around 11 euros, other dishes vary from 9 - 15 euros. There is a huge selection of tortillas that you can choose from. It works out as approximately 25 euros - 30 euros per person including wine. The staff are friendly and speak English, there is also an English menu. It is advisable to book a table! This restaurant is definitely authentic and Spanish and is off the beaten tourist track, tucked in on a side street. It is full of locals who know the restaurant by reputation. Fed up with the run of the mill tortillas made from heuvina (synthetic egg replacement) when out and about in Madrid I can't recommend it enough.

The waiters are courteous, the decor is hardly modernist chic, and the food is superb. We went for breakfast of churros, chocolate and coffee. The churros were freshly made and tasty. The chocolate, served in a little bowl, was rich and thick. My friend ordered coffee, and she was not disappointed. The waiters were attentive, but did not hover. The activity was constant.

This is a very traditional Spanish menu with a nice touch of elegant flair...and cooked to absolute perfection. I will add that we also ate at Pan Lugo (very fancy upscale dining) and we preferred this place for a better, more comfortable dining experience.

So we saw their meal special, they did not have tables so we sat at the bar for over 20 minutes. Other places would have sat you somewhere since there were open tables outside but it was for dinners a la cart This is 4 adults and 2 children under 5. Asked if we could just order at the bar and were told it would not be long. After over 20 minutes got a table. Asked if we could get our drink and only came back with 2. Asked another server and said they would get it still no drinks after some time asked again and we all got our drinks. By the time we sat down the special had increased by a Euro but by then we didn't care. So I order the empanada which was really good. The fries came next. Asked for ketchup none came. By then our rib came. Not much meat just hard gristle. My daughter ordered chicken which was a good choice. Finally got 3 ketchup packs for all four of us. Asked for extra and after 5 minutes got 3 more packs. We ordered the flan and ice cream which we liked. I speak Spanish so our issues were not due to the language. I felt they were not into tourist and spent their time catering to locals who were spending more on the white table cloth dinning area.

Staff were lovely and patient with our broken Spanish and did have some English language skills themselves (better than our Spanglish!). If you love tortillas this place is a MUST!

We dined in the tapas (more informal) area; there is also a salon for more elaborate meat and fish entres. Our four tapas and desserts were just OK; inventive yet lacking in flavor; service was rushed at first and then disappeared entirely once things got busy. We arrived a bit early for drinks before the 9pm crowd rolled in. No fewer than 4 waiters kept asking if we were ready to order; good intentions but a bit pushy and interrupting always. We had four dishes: the sardine, croquetas, merluza, and grilled veges. Sardine was cold, bland. Croquetas were undercooked and too gooey. Merluza was an excellent fish -- delicate - cooked perfectly - but the limited cream sauce didn't do any favors. Grilled veges were probably the best, but they came out late and lukewarm. Vino tinto by the glass selection was limited to 2 options; Ribeira was excellent; the Rioja seemed cheap. Table bread was completely dry (yesterday's?). Best dish of the evening was the queso izarraitz wrapped in membrillo in the shape of cannelloni and a side of cinnamon ice cream - this was inventive and came together well. The service that was over-eager at the start of the meal was nowhere to be found, to ask for a coffee or the bill -- had to get the hostess's attention for the bill as they were too busy. The atmosphere is lively and good, but we other chose the wrong dishes or the kitchen afford to step up its game.",2016-11-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d990954-Reviews-or10-Membibre-Madrid.html,UID_36760,0.064,0.788,0.148,0.9848,0.2682866612554113,0.6078869047619048,0.3311928571428572,1459,115,0.0788211103495545,0,45,False,50,0.1224489795918367,0.1428571428571428,0.2857142857142857,0.0816326530612244,0.1020408163265306,0.0408163265306122,0.0,0.0,0.1632653061224489,0.0612244897959183,261,176,4.593869731800766,0,0,enjoy dinner saturday night theater dine tapa inform area also salon elabor meat fish entr four tapa dessert ok invent yet lack flavor servic rush first disappear entir thing got busi arriv bit earli drink pm crowd roll fewer waiter kept ask readi order good intent bit pushi interrupt alway four dish sardin croqueta merluza grill vege sardin cold bland croqueta undercook gooey merluza excel fish delic cook perfectli limit cream sauc favor grill vege probabl best came late lukewarm vino tinto glass select limit option ribeira excel rioja seem cheap tabl bread complet dri yesterday best dish even queso izarraitz wrap membrillo shape cannelloni side cinnamon ice cream invent came togeth well servic eager start meal nowher found ask coffe bill get hostess attent bill busi atmospher live good chose wrong dish kitchen afford step game,average review,3

We chose it partly because of strong Trip Advisor reviews but also because it was no more than a 5 minute walk from our hotel and the weather was stormy. As other reviewers have mentioned, you get a generous amount of freebies here. A glass of cava when you arrive, and then a small cup of gazpacho plus a generous dollop of cream cheese and croutons as tasty amuse bouches. After dinner is over, there are complimentary bite size puddings (two each in our case) and a flask of something akin to limoncella is left with you to help yourself. The compulsory bread basket is priced at just over 2 euros, which seems very reasonable when you consider what else arrives for nothing! The portions of what you do pay for are big, so be warned. Either arrive very hungry, share a starter or a dessert between two people, or restrict yourselves (as we did) to just a main course each (plus a vegetable side dish in my case to accompany the lemon chicken). The serving staff were lovely, with good English spoken. The house white wine at around 11 euros per bottle was extremely tasty and highly recommended.

Given the reviews I found here, we decided we had to go there just after we arrived in Madrid to have a decent breakfast. The place is small, but very central (just take Paseo del Prado for a while and then take a left if you come from Atocha). The most amazing thing about that place... well, I'm still undecided, since the amazing service and the mouthwatering churros con chocolat are about even. When we got there, the place was empty, but soon it was really crowded with both tourists and locals, but that didn't stop the staff from greating everyone and offering some complimentary pastries and getting the food to everyone on time. About that food: we only tried the churros con chocolat, the Pakistani (or something resembling the word Pakistani) tea and the expresso, and all of them were amazing, even the expresso, which is actually hard to find around Spain. The churros were really tasty, crunchy with a soft center, not too oily and the portion was really large. The chocolat isn't too sweet, which I generally find a turnoff, but the cup was so big it ended up being the right amount of sweet and creamy goodness to dunk your churro.",2013-05-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1788549-Reviews-or290-Chocolat-Madrid.html,UID_8426,0.032,0.831,0.137,0.9881,0.1585,0.4934047619047619,0.4718714285714286,1432,133,0.092877094972067,0,38,False,51,0.125,0.175,0.3,0.075,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.05,0.0,258,163,4.554263565891473,0,0,tempt go anoth churrer well known sinc alreadi know one place known food mean best decid look altern end find one random post somewher internet given review found decid go arriv madrid decent breakfast place small central take paseo del prado take left come atocha amaz thing place well still undecid sinc amaz servic mouthwat churro con chocolat even got place empti soon realli crowd tourist local stop staff great everyon offer complimentari pastri get food everyon time food tri churro con chocolat pakistani someth resembl word pakistani tea expresso amaz even expresso actual hard find around spain churro realli tasti crunchi soft center oili portion realli larg chocolat sweet gener find turnoff cup big end right amount sweet creami good dunk churro,good review,4

I chose it for the location - Plazza Isabel II near the Opera. The Plazza had a buzz of energy and this looked welcoming for a lone traveller. I started with a huge health green salad and the Ravioli which was the best I have had, all homemade with a delicious light pink sauce. Very tasty and just the right portion. The thing about this restaurant was their pride in their cuisine and they provided samples for all the guests. These included a complimentary glass of pink Cava, bread rounds and herbed butter, soup in a glass, sorbet, chocolate yoghurt and berries. The crème caramel at the end was homemade and just so yummy. All complimented with the local wine. This gave a great example of what is available and for a solo traveller this is great and it is impossible to sample tapas.

As we were looking for a table the manager approached us and gave us choices for seating. We decided for a table inside to stay away from smokers.  Even so the restaurant was packed within few minutes the waitress took our order of drinks and as soon as we put down the menus our order for food was taken. The lunch was excellent. With the drinks they brought us one “tapa” as well as two small bowls of pumpkin soup that was delicious. Our order was grilled to perfection. We took a light lunch but we were served additional things like a yogurt/fruit jam dessert, lemon sherbet and Lemoncello. While there we observed the different dishes being served and decided that we were going back for dinner to try some other of the tempting dishes they have. The dinner was as good as our lunch. We choose the 12.5 EU dinner that included (2) grilled meats, potatoes and salad as well as the drinks and dessert, including flan that was very good.  I would highly recommend this restaurant. The food is excellent and the service is timely, courteous and efficient. It is an Argentine owned restaurant so they know how to chose and grill their meats.

We quickly got a seat and ordered. I ordered a ribeye medium and the asparagus. When the meat came out it was incredibly tough and was rare. I do not generally like to have my food taken back for fear of retribution, so I ate around the edges where the steak was less rare, but by no means medium. There was a large majority of the steak that I couldn't eat. My sister the braver of us, asked them to cook her steak longer. It was the worse cut of meat that I have tasted. I was so disappointed, especially since the restaurant is a little pricey. This was the worst meal that I have had in Madrid. The service was okay, and the only great thing about the meal was the asparagus. The asparagus were probably the best tasting that I have had and the reason this place did not get a rating of one.

We enjoyed the beef steak, cooked as ordered, medium rare. There were two disappointments in our experience here. Perhaps we should have known better, but when we sat down to read the menu, our waiter brought a basket of lovely bread and rolls, which we sampled, and enjoyed. When our bill arrived, we discovered that the bread and rolls were not complementary -- we were charged 6.60 euros. If we had known this, we would have passed on the bread. Secondly, as some other reviewers have mentioned, the service was not as attentive as we would expect for a restaurant in this category. It took a long time for our waiter to return to take our orders, bring us our drinks, and to bring the meals. His attitude was very ""standoffish"" We felt that he ignored us, even though the restaurant was not busy - such a difference from the experiences we had in every other restaurant we visited in Madrid. Our total bill, for 3 adults, including wine, was 111 Euros.

I went by at lunch time to book a table and reserved a table for 2 at 7pm later that night. The guy who took our reservation was lovely and very friendly and said it was no problem. When my mum and I arrived at 7pm we were greeted and seated in a back area, almost like private dining and we were the only people in that area, everyone else was in the front or outside. We just assumed that as the Spanish traditionally eat later at night, perhaps we were just a bit early. However, the service we experienced was awful. The girl who served us was downright horrible and gave us dirty looks from the minute we sat down. She was cleaning that area and would mop right at our feet hitting us with it and scowling at us. My mum was really upset and kept saying to me do you think we have done something wrong? are we not meant to be here? When she came over and took our order, she rolled her eyes every time we asked a question about the menu. She then walked away from us and we again felt like we'd done something wrong. When she brought our food out the plates were literally slammed on the table, it was so loud I felt really bad like i wasn't meant to be there. We were given complimentary appetisers and when we asked what they were as we really enjoyed them she just walked away from us. Her attitude and expressions towards us were horrible and we felt guilty for eating in the restaurant - like we were an inconvenience to her! After the main course, we had a different waiter tend to us who was really kind and explained the mango sorbet to us and told us facts about Madrid which lightened up our evening. we were going to order dessert but chose not to as my mum was scared this would anger the waitress even more. When we asked for the bill she chucked it on the table and walked off. It was a very disappointing experience and even more so because the food was great and the set up with all of the complimentary appetisers and after dinner snacks was fabulous! It could have been a great night but we were left feeling horrible and wished we'd never been so excited to visit. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. I wish it had been better but treating customers like that is really sad, i reiterate what i said previously in the fact that we felt like we were doing something wrong by eating there. Maybe we were just there too early, but if so our reservation shouldn't have been taken. I can't say I would recommend this to others as it was generally a disheartening and upsetting experience, especially for my mum.",2016-10-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4690521-Reviews-or60-De_Maria_Opera-Madrid.html,UID_36802,0.094,0.792,0.114,0.8809,-0.0115536088649296,0.5778541479484876,0.6119826086956521,2661,271,0.1018414130026306,2,41,False,112,0.0686274509803921,0.0686274509803921,0.1666666666666666,0.0294117647058823,0.1176470588235294,0.088235294117647,0.0686274509803921,0.1078431372549019,0.196078431372549,0.088235294117647,510,257,4.219607843137255,0,0,walk past restaur time whilst madrid alway busi thought would great choic went lunch time book tabl reserv tabl pm later night guy took reserv love friendli said problem mum arriv pm greet seat back area almost like privat dine peopl area everyon els front outsid assum spanish tradit eat later night perhap bit earli howev servic experienc aw girl serv us downright horribl gave us dirti look minut sat clean area would mop right feet hit us scowl us mum realli upset kept say think done someth wrong meant came took order roll eye everi time ask question menu walk away us felt like done someth wrong brought food plate liter slam tabl loud felt realli bad like meant given complimentari appetis ask realli enjoy walk away us attitud express toward us horribl felt guilti eat restaur like inconveni main cours differ waiter tend us realli kind explain mango sorbet us told us fact madrid lighten even go order dessert chose mum scare would anger waitress even ask bill chuck tabl walk disappoint experi even food great set complimentari appetis dinner snack fabul could great night left feel horribl wish never excit visit get fast enough wish better treat custom like realli sad reiter said previous fact felt like someth wrong eat mayb earli reserv taken say would recommend other gener dishearten upset experi especi mum,very bad review,1

The quality of food was very high and the service excellent. There is no need to order an aperitif, starter or dessert. A glass of pink fizz, some crostini, a mango sorbet and half a jug of limoncello were complimentary. Leaving us only needing to order a main and some wine. Both of which were good quality and well-priced. The salads are enormous, and were hugely popular with most diners in being the height of summer, but we also saw a delicious steak being brought out and I expect that none of the food could be faulted, the menu was wide-ranging between salads, grills and nice looking pasta dishes. The restaurant also offers an incredible fixed price menu at 10 euro - for location, style and professionalism of the staff (as well more freebie nibbles/drinks than you can shake a stick at) it would be hard to beat. The restaurant also has cooling water sprays on the terrace to ensure the clientele stay cool. You would not get such quality elsewhere.

We found this location and were excited by the reviews. When we enter, I greeted with a hello and immediately the bald guy behind the bar asked if we had reservations. He didn't care to acknowledge us. We said no but he sat us down. The place was not full at all.  I must say, the big bald guy was beyond the worse waiter, owner, what ever he was. I have never experienced such bad service.  First of all, the food is good. Try the shrimp croquets and the liquid croquets. DO NOT TRY THE STEAK ON SUSHI RICE, if you like your steak well done.  Second, the menu is so difficult to read. We asked the bald guy to explain some things and you can tell he was beyond annoyed from the moment we sat down. I felt him breathing down my neck. He definitely wanted us out.  Third, he came so fast with the receipt and threw it on the table. Once we paid, I kept saying thank you to him and making eye contact and so did my boyfriend but nothing. The cooks that were bringing the food out were actually nice and helped us out when we ordered our wine bottle.  The place is alright but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to take your hard earn money elsewhere.

They change the menu VERY CONSTANTLY and every new menu is great. Often you feel disappointed at first because the dishes you had the previous time had disappeared but the new dishes are always equally great. Service is friendly and polite yet I believe they could use a extra hand. It does feel as if the service is trying but at times they are just overwhelmed. They could really use an extra waiter (it would be more pleasant for both customers and employees). Just go and try as many Croquetas you can!
