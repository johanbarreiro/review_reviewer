The caveat is that you will need to sit at the counter area like the locals do and order the food there. In this area, you get a choice of 3 menus of ‚Ç¨10 to ‚Ç¨13.50 which comes with the type of sausage, steak, dessert, salad/fries and wine. Taking the basic ‚Ç¨10 to ‚Ç¨13.50 menu, this is excellent value and still fee the vice of a typical tapa like bar. The higher the set menu price, the better the cut of the steak. However, if you wish to get rib eye or sirloin steak, you have to take table service where the price doubles and the food item you order that comes exactly from the same menu cost 2-3 times more.  The cuts at the set menu are not great and is mediocre . But if you crave for typical steak and meat menu at a cheap price- this is excellent value.

The decor is fresh and our waitress was very friendly, if a bit forgetful - I had to ask twice for water and extra cutlery. It was a Sunday night and not terribly busy, but the atmosphere was still good. After seating us we (not my cousin's daughter!) were served complimentary fizzy pink wine, and once the waitress had taken our orders she brought us small glasses of gazpacho. We shared two starter dishes - both very tasty, and hence our need for extra cutlery - and had the sliced steak for three as our main. This was cooked to perfection for all of our tastes (the blue side of rare) and came with fries. We all chose different desserts, and again each got a small, complimentary chocolate mousse. These unexpected extras are a nice touch, but left me feeling very full! There was an extensive wine list, but the waitress wasn't really able to help us choose. I therefore chose a mid-priced bottle of red which turned out to be very good. This was a brilliant choice for my cousin's daughter, who loved it all, and would also suit any hard-core carnivore! It was a little on the expensive side by Madrid standards and my personal preference is for more characterful restaurants serving traditional Spanish regional cuisines.",2016-06-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991438-Reviews-or120-Parrilla_El_Gaucho-Madrid.html,UID_29871,0.01,0.814,0.176,0.9942,0.1953156565656565,0.4844444444444444,0.333175,1421,118,0.0830401125967628,3,38,False,52,0.1269841269841269,0.1746031746031746,0.3174603174603174,0.0793650793650793,0.1269841269841269,0.0158730158730158,0.0158730158730158,0.0317460317460317,0.0634920634920634,0.0476190476190476,251,171,4.665338645418327,0,0,take cousin year old daughter dinner stay madrid want steak cousin chose argentinian restaur coupl block sol decor fresh waitress friendli bit forget ask twice water extra cutleri sunday night terribl busi atmospher still good seat us cousin daughter serv complimentari fizzi pink wine waitress taken order brought us small glass gazpacho share two starter dish tasti henc need extra cutleri slice steak three main cook perfect tast blue side rare came fri chose differ dessert got small complimentari chocol mouss unexpect extra nice touch left feel full extens wine list waitress realli abl help us choos therefor chose mid price bottl red turn good brilliant choic cousin daughter love would also suit hard core carnivor littl expens side madrid standard person prefer charact restaur serv tradit spanish region cuisin,average review,3

We actually made the reservation whilst passing the previous day, and spoke to a gentleman who was clearly senior - Owner or Manager; to check that he could cater for my daughter who has a lactose intolerance. I had also made sure that we carried a card specifically explaining her lactose intolerance - translated into Spanish to avoid confusion. The gentleman who took our booking promised he could provide a good dinner without lactose for may daughter, so we made the booking. When we arrived and were shown to our table we again showed the waitress the card explaining that my daughter has lactose intolerance. She read the card and then really was not interested. When we checked that our order (Argentinian Grill) was completely lactose free (Sin Lactosa) she rudely told us it is meat - no lactose. I asked about the sausages in the grill - again she said it is meat, no milk. I asked her to check with the chef since I know that Chorizo does have milk in it, she again said it is meat, but said she would ask. She came back very quickly to advise us that it was all safe, so we took her at her word. Her service throughout was rude, even pushing my brother-in-law to make room for the wine cooler.  When the food came it was pretty poor - meat was extremely rare - we were not asked how we liked it. Service remained poor. During the night my daughter became very sick and knew that she had ingested lactose.  The next day we visited the restaurant again to complain, and again met the gentleman who took our booking. He remembered out requirement for lastose free meal, and even showed us his menu with allergy information, where it clearly stated that this menu item contain milk. Although he was apologetic, the damage was done. His staff should have offered us the allergy menu, or at least referred to it. I would not recommend this restaurant to any body. If the staff are too lazy and rude to check for food allergies, and can't be bothered to ask for cooking preferences then they do not deserve to have a job in a restaurant.",2016-05-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991438-Reviews-or120-Parrilla_El_Gaucho-Madrid.html,UID_25716,0.106,0.81,0.084,-0.9025,0.0625205254515599,0.5197318007662836,0.5680736842105263,2135,190,0.0889929742388758,0,47,False,75,0.0439560439560439,0.1208791208791208,0.2857142857142857,0.0219780219780219,0.1758241758241758,0.0769230769230769,0.0659340659340659,0.0549450549450549,0.1098901098901098,0.0439560439560439,391,210,4.457800511508951,0,0,visit restaur rd may famili recommend good friend actual made reserv whilst pass previou day spoke gentleman clearli senior owner manag check could cater daughter lactos intoler also made sure carri card specif explain lactos intoler translat spanish avoid confus gentleman took book promis could provid good dinner without lactos may daughter made book arriv shown tabl show waitress card explain daughter lactos intoler read card realli interest check order argentinian grill complet lactos free sin lactosa rude told us meat lactos ask sausag grill said meat milk ask check chef sinc know chorizo milk said meat said would ask came back quickli advis us safe took word servic throughout rude even push brother law make room wine cooler food came pretti poor meat extrem rare ask like servic remain poor night daughter becam sick knew ingest lactos next day visit restaur complain met gentleman took book rememb requir lastos free meal even show us menu allergi inform clearli state menu item contain milk although apologet damag done staff offer us allergi menu least refer would recommend restaur bodi staff lazi rude check food allergi bother ask cook prefer deserv job restaur,very bad review,1

A few people have commented that the waiting staff's English isn't that good & I would agree, but you're in Spain! We both had the fillet steak and I can say it was, without doubt, the best steak we've ever had and we've had our fare share of Scottish and Irish steak! Yes, dinner is served on bamboo plates, with only a bamboo stick as 'cutlery', but that didn't matter a bit, as the food was superb! To be honest, I'm not sure there's room for a dishwasher in the place! (the plates / bamboo sticks are all recycled) As we were nearing the end of our meal, the owner of the restaurant came to ask how our meal was - what a lovely, lovely man! He sat with us, giving us his history and the background to the restaurant (the name Bayres is a combination of Buenos and Aires!). Although he wouldn't admit it, his English is good! He has been importing beef to Spain from Argentina for 25 years, so he certainly knows his stuff!

The restaurant is modern and well laid out even if a little too tight & compact. The food is lacking! The Chorizo and Morchillo was too fatty and course, the salad was acceptable without being special. Most of us ordered the solomillo (filet steak) and plate arrives with only that item on the plate, nothing else. Good that we ordered a plate of vegetables to share but even that was a bit on the small side for 5 people. The solomillos so were ordered in a variety of styles from rare to well done but none of them arrived correctly cooked. How can a chef not prepare and deliver a piece of meat as ordered? The well done option arrived bloody and rare, the medium was totally rare and uncooked. The chef needs to return to cooking school. Quite a good wine list with Spanish and Argentine options.

They are in a very central area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMadrid (in the back of Cibeles), in a short street but with excellent restaurants. It is homemade traditional North Spanish cooking, with an excellent quality of seasonal ingredients and a simple and careful preparation. Vegetables are exceptional and fresh: for example, they have a tomato salad that is nothing more than the most incredible of tomatoes (I do not know where they get it from but then no tomato tastes like anything), and a salad of beans green with foie that is absolutely fantastic; artichokes are also exceptional. Gorgeous meats and fish, but the homemade stews are something unique: meatballs, tripe, sometimes they cooked battered chard, etc., all of them really fantastic. The egg dishes and the croquettes are fantastic (the eggs with Burgos black pudding are absolutely incredible). I have to congratulate the restaurant because they have half portions of some dishes, which allows us to try more dishes. For dessert - all of them homemade - they have a really good panchineta. The wine selection is careful and varied - we usually accept the recommendations because they always surprise us. There are not many tables (some high in the entrance, and the bar is always full) and there is always a reservation, at noon or at night. The service is fast, efficient and very friendly.

Grilled with a little sea salt accompanied by fresh chimichurri. That's all it needed. And to think it was a sirloin cut which in America is the medium grade. Best sirloin I've ever had. It was accompanied with some mozzarella and cherry tomatoes with Argentinian style bread as a vehicle for your meat.  Drink: the Sangria lasted only 5 minutes. Red wine with soda. That good.  Service: Safi was great. I asked him about the meat and he explained as best he could in English. Regardless I got the idea of what he was trying to say. Open field cows raised in Argentina. I gave the chef a thumbs up as a compliment to how good the meat was. At the end of our meal, unexpectedly, Safi gave us both a shot of a cream liquor. Very baileys like. Really great staff there.  When in Madrid, stop by! It's small so you may miss it. But if you do happen to find it, enjoy. I sure did.

Bayres was the exception to the rule as it turned to be the best meat restaurant in Madrid! I went there for an early dinner and the service was honestly quite poor. Tables were barely cleaned up and only essential crockeries and spices were available. The waiter spoke a limited English but he understood my order but never seemed interested in giving a decent service, actually quite annoyed I was the only customer ordering in the first hour of the dinner time. On the contrary, food was amazing. Seriously, tasty and well cooked, the starter with a sausage sandwich was ideal, no wonder I finished in a few minutes! As a main, I ordered a steak, served with chimichurri but also cherry tomato and mozzarella (like the sandwich). Again, something to die for, cooked rare-medium as advised. Prices are very low for the quality of the meat and you can easily order 2 sandwiches and a steak if you are really hungry, without risking to pay more than EUR 20! Service must be more professional (the owner actually seemed very kind asking me if I was happy with the meal in the end) because it was amateurish,even a bit unpolite.",2016-01-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3674049-Reviews-or120-Bayres_Beef_Argentina_en_tapas-Madrid.html,UID_4212,0.091,0.736,0.174,0.9707,0.2150614439324117,0.4956835637480798,0.54699,1211,100,0.0825763831544178,3,28,False,51,0.1041666666666666,0.1041666666666666,0.3541666666666667,0.0,0.1666666666666666,0.0208333333333333,0.0208333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.125,0.0625,214,144,4.663551401869159,0,0,holiday madrid review often overestim real valu restaur bayr except rule turn best meat restaur madrid went earli dinner servic honestli quit poor tabl bare clean essenti crockeri spice avail waiter spoke limit english understood order never seem interest give decent servic actual quit annoy custom order first hour dinner time contrari food amaz serious tasti well cook starter sausag sandwich ideal wonder finish minut main order steak serv chimichurri also cherri tomato mozzarella like sandwich someth die cook rare medium advis price low qualiti meat easili order sandwich steak realli hungri without risk pay eur servic must profession owner actual seem kind ask happi meal end amateurish even bit unpolit,good review,4

After the waiter explained the specials, we decided on the 5-course menu for 2, which included a couple of the specials. When we asked the waiter for wine suggestions to pair with the menu, he suggested that we trust him to give us a small glass of an appropriate wine for each course.   We started with a glass of cava from Muga winery in the Rioja, which we had just visited the day before. Then with the first course of luscious ripe tomatoes and Parmesan cheese, we were served a nice vegetal white Spanish wine. This was followed by two more full-bodied whites with the next courses: baby artichokes, wonderful ham and mushroom croquettes, and perfectly cooked sea bass. The final course was a delectable dish of grilled Iberian pork, also perfectly cooked, accompanied by a full-bodied red. I wish I had written down the names of the wines (all were Spanish), but alas I didn't.

There are not many restaurants in the world that we have gone back to twice. The chorizo as well as several various cuts of beef. Most people would assume the tenderloin or rib eye would be the best, however this was not the case. No doubt the tenderloin and rib eye were unbelievably and succulent, we found that the best was actually the skirt steak. I know, I know, that's an odd choice and is clearly a cheaper cut of meat, but you have to listen to me on this one. The skirt steak was not only tender, but packed full of proper beef flavour, the nutty deep flavour that you get in well aged beef (although I am not sure if this is aged at all). The chorizo was also amazing, as was the chimichurri sauce it was served with. The potatoes were also amazing. If I recall correctly, they charge 10 euros for 1.5 L of sangria. Most places charge that for 1 L of sangria. So that's a plus for sure.  I have been to Kobe, Japan and have eaten A4 grade wagyu beef (A5 being the highest). While that was undeniably delicious, I would say the experience I had at Bayers was comparable. While the meat they serve is not as tender as the rediculous marbling of wagyu beef, the skirt steak was just a wave of beef flavour.  If you get the chance to swing by here I would highly recommend it. I would also recommend Taberna del Chato which is just a stone throws away. Heck, since this is Spain, go to both in one day.",2014-11-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3674049-Reviews-or220-Bayres_Beef_Argentina_en_tapas-Madrid.html,UID_29970,0.028,0.818,0.154,0.993,0.2163888888888888,0.5125462962962963,0.2916555555555555,1531,150,0.0979751796211626,0,42,False,56,0.0256410256410256,0.1282051282051282,0.3076923076923077,0.0512820512820512,0.1794871794871795,0.0256410256410256,0.0,0.0769230769230769,0.1538461538461538,0.0512820512820512,298,169,4.134228187919463,0,0,want convert vegetarian place madrid four day came twice mani restaur world gone back twice chorizo well sever variou cut beef peopl would assum tenderloin rib eye would best howev case doubt tenderloin rib eye unbeliev succul found best actual skirt steak know know odd choic clearli cheaper cut meat listen one skirt steak tender pack full proper beef flavour nutti deep flavour get well age beef although sure age chorizo also amaz chimichurri sauc serv potato also amaz recal correctli charg euro l sangria place charg l sangria plu sure kobe japan eaten grade wagyu beef highest undeni delici would say experi bayer compar meat serv tender redicul marbl wagyu beef skirt steak wave beef flavour get chanc swing would highli recommend would also recommend taberna del chato stone throw away heck sinc spain go one day,very good review,5

She recommended Garcia de la Navarra.  When we arrived, we should have walked out. It was empty at 10 pm (which unlike the USA is prime time in Spain). The Head Waiter came and bombarded us with specials, then drinks and brought us bread and bottled water (none of which we had ordered). Earlier we had a big 2+ hour lunch so we were really just looking for a light supper. Our instincts after the head waiter's greeting was again to run.  My wife and I both asked several questions about some of the items and the menu itself and it seems even the prices on the menu were just suggestions and the specials were very vague.  We thought that the first course that arrived were supposed to be part of our main course. We did not want appetizers. They were not of course. We were charged 16 Euros for a small plate of plain green beans (no hammer tuna) and 12 Euros for a plate of tomatoes plus 5.6 Euros for bread we did not order and 6 Euros for water we did not order.  In all, we were charged almost 100 Euro for a quick supper.  Having said all that, the food itself was quite good but save yourself the aggravation of the bill and go somewhere else.

The waiters work extremely hard in a small space fielding query after query about availability while serving the tables.

It's tucked away in an unassuming location, and is quite small, but what it lacked in space it more than made up for in food and service. Not all the waiters spoke great English but were incredibly friendly and very accommodating. We ordered a couple drinks each and then went with the ""Duo"" menu item which is essentially a sampler with 2 sausages and all 4 different cuts of beef. Man was it all ridiculously tasty. By far the filet was the star of the show but the sirloin also more than held its own. The sausage was in fact way better than expected, perfectly seasoned and cooked.

This restaurant was located on Madrid's Opera Square and was conveniently located to my hotel. A prie fixe menu of 15 euros provided the following: a starter of either morcilla or fresh chorizo (I chose morcilla and was delighted), a salad, bread, an expertly grilled entrana steak (skirt steak), cooked by a 20-something who handled the grill like a pro. Dessert was included - I chose a panna cotta with berry sauce (delicious). My young waiter, with a twinkle in his eye, then poured me a shot of crema de guina, a cherry-anise liqueur from Asturias that was most interesting. My steak was cooked rare, per my instruction and the service was attentive. I also had lunch here on another day (a spinach salad with shrimp, fresh mozzarella and walnuts, dressed with oil and vinegar). Prices are fair and the wine and beer are delicious.  I rarely see Argentinian beef at home and decided to try it. Quite happy that I did. For my Spanish friends, I did eat authentically Spanish food in many other places.

We certainly found that with Bayres beef and more besides. Bayres beef serves some of the best Argentinian beef I have ever tasted. The meat was beautifully tender and cooked to perfection ( we asked for it medium ) and the accompaniments were just as delicious. The baked potato was devoured in seconds and the cherry tomatoes and mozzarella skewers were a treat. My youngest, who is a terrible eater, had no issues with any of the food and enjoyed a plate of chorizo sausage all to herself.  All the staff were happy to chat and were more than patient with me when I tried to practise my Spanish ( badly) on them. The staff and the owner made the whole experience even more enjoyable by their attentiveness and friendliness to my family.  The greatest surprise came at the end of the evening when we got the bill. As this is a restaurant in the heart of Madrid, I would have expected to pay a small fortune for the amount we had to eat and drink, but the bill came to well under 100 euros, and I mean well under!  I would recommend this place to all types of people on all types of visits. I will definitely be visiting again.

It is small, singularly bare, very run down looking ( deliberately done that way I think ). Ordinary chairs and tables, poorly finished walls , no decorations, one would think even seedy looking. We were rather concerned about how poor it looked, even wondering whether to go in or not. But the temptation of veggie food and hunger made us enter. The place was sparsely occupied, and we were promptly attended to by an unconventional looking young man who was very pleasant and bubbly. He frankly said it was too early for dinner and they only had a few appetisers to offer and we decided to brave it. We ordered a cucumber starter with some spice added to it, and a beetroot hummous ( first time in my life i have heard of such a thing LOL ! ) and a almonds with paprika. Also ordered a beer The beetroot hummous was out of this world, deliciously done, smooth, very tasty. The almonds were crisp roasted and dusted with paprika and just very crunchable. The cucumbers were watery and relatively tasteless . I also had a pumpkin and ginger cream soup , the soup itself was excellent though I did not get much ginger from it.

Like to the point where I thought I was going to be sick kind of hungry! Due to this I thought I wouldn't be able to eat much but as soon as the food came and I took the first bite I could not eat it fast enough! They offer you a bowl of chips while you wait. We ordered the Duo platter, which has two sausages, rump, sirloin, and fillet steak, so you can try all of their cuts. They cooked it to perfection (truly medium rare, not what many places give you where it's just slightly pink inside and they call it medium rare) and seasoned it just right. They serve it with skewers (2) of a single cherry tomato and a small boccaccini ball as well as bread and an awesome chimichurri sauce (seeing as it is an Argentinian beef restaurant) The two of us quickly devoured the whole thing, it was so tasty! If you are a true steak lover you must come here, you won't be disappointed!! And when the bill comes, you get a free shot of a Bailey's-type liqueur. Very nice! Also, they use thick paper plates instead of porcelain and no utensils, just wooden skewers to pick up your meat (as it's cut into bite-sized strips).

Booked for Thursday. Arrived and met by one of 3 waiting staff. Sat in corner as was quite busy. Decor is minimalistic with great tiled table tops. Good choice on menu so went for 3 appetisers then I had main meal and my wife had salad. Starters were very disappointing. Seaweed salad particularly not nice. Mains were much better. Main problem was slow and poor service. Asked for water as we were warm. Somebody else then came and took wine order, both very slow to come. Starters came with no side plates or cutlery.

Another Trip Adviser diner complained that there was a ""table service and bread"" charge, and while we also found that unusual, we didn't find it excessive and we were delighted to have several free surprises brought to the table. It started with a refreshing and well-chilled glass of pink cava, followed by two small glasses of a very nice soup plus toasts, and at the end a cup of chocolate mousse and a sorbet.

Garcia de la Navarra has everything you want in a restaurant: Great service, fantastic food, tasty wines and just a perfect atmosphere. The quality of the food is of a very high level and the price is just great. Luis and Pedro are great hosts, you feel welcome and appreciated as a customer. The restaurant has a front area where you can sit at high tables or at the bar and enjoy bites, food and drinks. It kind of has a relaxed feeling over it. When you walk further to the back, you can find the restaurant area. The cuisine is always with ingredients of the season. They are non-complicated, but great flavored dishes, for example artichokes, octopus, lamb chops etc. Luis is always there to recommend a fitting wine for the dishes or your taste.

One is on calle Luna, the other on calle Alamo. We went to both. The main restaurant, which is cozy and charming (on Luna) was good. I enjoyed the ""golden milk"" (coconut milk, turmeric and cinnamon I believe) and the beet veggie burger I got. The waiter was a sullen millennial who didn't know squat about the wines he served and was moody and unfriendly, but the food was pretty good. Now, if you want to eat before they open at 8, they will direct you to their other location on Alamo; DON'T GO!!! I mean it. This place was awful. Again, a foolish millennial was the waiter, but the food was worse than bad. I ordered the same drink and they botched it beyond recognition. It had at least 2 TABLESPOONS of powdery turmeric powder in the bottom and tasted like p00p. That's a pretty pricey 5 euro yucky drink. I got the ""meatball"" dish and it was so salty, I could barely stand it. The onion soup was semi tasty, but again, too much salt! Who ever is overseeing the second restaurant has work to do!

Loved their Quinoa bowl as well as the curry Tofu dish. Their menu changes daily. They keep it simple with just three options and that‚Äôs why they can keep the quality, taste and freshness so well.

I came on my first night in Madrid with some friends, and loved it so much I came back again on my last night! The first time I shared the antipasti dips, then 4 tapas: the raw lasagne, the carpaccio, mushrooms croquettes and wedges with Vega sauce, and a cheesecake for dessert. The food was impeccably presented and just so so delicious, I was so impressed. As a vegan who only really goes to vegan restaurants when eating out in different cities, this had to be one of my best experiences! The next time I had the korma curry which was just incredible, so flavoursome and such a good portion size, with bread on the side which was also so delicious.

For 11.50 euros we had a small, 100g piece of beef cut into slices on a plate and a salad for 5 euros that was also very average. What i really absolutely hated was the fact that everything was served on plastic plates with plastic cutlery and even the salad dressing is in a plastic individual portion. If i'd known any of this before we'd ordered our meal i would have gotten up and left and not let it spoil our night, which it did. The restaurant isn't in a very nice area of Madrid....there's nightclubs surrounding and hawkers trying to get people inside.....a few fights out on the street which i guess were good entertainment. Very very overpriced for what it serves. The tiny tapa sized piece of beef we had i would have expected to be priced as a tapa as with all the previous restaurants we'd been to.....not 11.50. We felt like we were on a plane or having a picnic somewhere....a shame because on the way back there were places with great atmospheres near the restaurant with much better ambience and cheaper prices......i guess you can't always 100% trust tripadvisor unless you read a few of the comments.... The only other things on the menu that were available were beef sandwiches.....and even the guests who were ordering those were sitting there shocked at the poverty size piece of meat on the pieces of bread (and they were locals....LOL).",2015-05-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3674049-Reviews-or180-Bayres_Beef_Argentina_en_tapas-Madrid.html,UID_20439,0.092,0.82,0.088,-0.2893,0.0827536231884057,0.4696376811594203,0.6251374999999999,1469,136,0.0925799863852961,0,59,False,47,0.0869565217391304,0.108695652173913,0.108695652173913,0.108695652173913,0.1521739130434782,0.0652173913043478,0.108695652173913,0.0434782608695652,0.1304347826086956,0.0869565217391304,263,168,4.5893536121673,0,0,servic excel feel look food overpr euro small g piec beef cut slice plate salad euro also averag realli absolut hate fact everyth serv plastic plate plastic cutleri even salad dress plastic individu portion known order meal would gotten left let spoil night restaur nice area madrid nightclub surround hawker tri get peopl insid fight street guess good entertain overpr serv tini tapa size piec beef would expect price tapa previou restaur felt like plane picnic somewher shame way back place great atmospher near restaur much better ambienc cheaper price guess alway trust tripadvisor unless read comment thing menu avail beef sandwich even guest order sit shock poverti size piec meat piec bread local lol,average review,3

Across the street was a very small restaurant with only 4 or 5 tables, 2 high tops and 2 stools at a small bar. One table was available, and we took a chance. In 25 days in Spain, it was the best spur of the moment decision we made. A very delightful young woman brought us menus and took our order for drinks. We could see from our table that there was another young woman preparing food in the small kitchen. We ordered ""tostas"" - half a roll, toasted with a variety of toppings. I had chicken with brie some veggies and an incredible lemon mustard sauce. My wife had smoked salmon. The combination of flavors of each of our dishes was far more sophisticated and delicious than we expected. We could not believe that such a small kitchen and one hard-working chef produced such delectable food. As we watched the chef prepare other orders, we saw how much thought and care went into each dish. Even the presentation was exceptional.

So glad we did as it just hit the spot for a quick and tasty meal.  Staff were friendly and seated us at the only spare table for 2. It's a small place and a bit of a tight fit.

It was like a rotating door.  The toast was out of this world! I wasn‚Äôt going to get it but I saw a table next to us order and I was curious. It was worth it and affordable. Heavy on the Brie, light balsamic and fresh arugula. The toast was thick and toasted perfect.  I initially came here for the empanadas I ordered a chicken and a beef one. They were baked and had a decent portion of filling but my taste buds gravitated towards the toast.  The wine was decent and affordable, the tables are very small so get ready to be on top of people. We call it the snuggle factor when your eating. I would recommend this location for a tapa experience. Just get ready to be in tight quarters and you will have to speak loudly.

The sangria was outstanding and they also served some delicious, fresh bread. The bread set the tone for the rest of the meal, everything was great.

The menu...,"This is an upmarket restaurant with contemporary decor serving Spanish food with a twist - a refreshing variation from the countless traditional Spanish tascas and restaurants all over Madrid. They encourage sharing so the method of serving is similar to a tasting menu. The menu can be a bit confusing because it consists of starters and main dishes but in the end all dishes are served to share - recommendation is to select 5-7 dishes. The ambiance and service was very good and the waiters were very helpful during the ordering process. Highlights include the ceviche limero (authentic), dumplings rabo de toro (very nice), sui mai, arroz cachufa (delicious fried rice), chili crab, pez mantequilla and albondigas al curry (not exactly standard in a Spanish restaurant) among others. The wine (Raso de Larrainzar from Navarra) really stood out. For desser the cheesecake experiment was exceptionally good as was the torrija. Chupitos went down well as well. The portions are are not large but the serving process ensures you will not go hungry. Five of us spent 230 euros (including 2 bottles of wine that were reasonably priced).

Service and intangibility means impacts in over 50% the clients satisfaction. Great location. Great food. Great ambience. Great layout. But what about the rest? I entered the restaurant alone, around 20h30, no one acknowledged me and I had to go directly to the floor manager (I assume). Once I reach him, there is not a ‚Äúhello‚Äù, ‚Äúgood evening‚Äù, he preferred to speak the business language ‚Äúdo you have a reservation?‚Äù.  I had a seat and the waiter comes to my table to drop something. Apparently, it was an appetizer but if I would have not asked and I would still be looking at it. I move forward, let‚Äôs get the waiter suggestions: Spicy Tuna. It was amazing indeed just like the perfect mango cheesecake. Another detail that I may highlight it is the fact that the 2 staff gentlemen instead of be focus on the staff, they were working on the laptop and speaking to each other. No smiles. Nothing. I felt that I was the +1 on that restaurant and that they were doing me a favor. Sorry, if it is a couples and family only. Maybe I was the one wrong at the end of the day. Sorry If I have caused any inconvenience. I rate Doki Doki 2. The service and intangibility impacts 60% and their 5* food service does not help them to have a higher rate from me.

We appreciated the discret but very attentive service, and the owner's friendly explanations of the menu, patiently repeated in three different languages to my different guests. We had tuna tartare, Misoyaki gindara, nigiris and shared various other dishes all exquisite and amazingly presented. The puddings were to die for, especially the gold coated chocolate fondant.

Last night, I just found it in this amazing little restaurant. Everything about my experience was fantastic. From the beautiful and very inviting atmosphere, to the extremely friendly staff, and of course not forgetting the amazing food I had. The owner/manager of the restaurant is extremely knowledgeable about what he's serving his clients, he will take the time to help you decipher the menu and make suggestions.

This was our fate. Following a frantic few minutes outside (I had been in the restaurant long enough when asking for the table to know that I absolutely had to dine there. The smells were captivating. I needed to eat the fusion of passion that is Singaporean, Peruvian and Spanish food). The waiter soon came outside to tell us that a table were leaving and that we could be squeezed in in ten minutes or so. Already 10/10 for the thoughtful waiting staff who could clearly see the distressed look on my face. Quick! Save that girl outside they thought! Upon seating we were treated exceptionally well. The attention to detail is what so many places are trying to achieve but often miss the mark ever so slightly (although sometimes you wonder if they've even been aiming at anything at all). No, we had odd cutlery and funky side plates, but it worked and everything had a purpose. The menu was by no means extensive, but I would have eaten everything on it twice over given the time.  My regret is not ordering the crab...but now I know I must return. We opted for the alitas (deboned chicken wings served in lettuce). These were the perfect kind of spicy, not too much but hit the spot. So flavoursome, I've been thinking about them all week. We also had the tuna steak, bocata de la reina, and the there was the ceviche. Easily the best ceviche I've ever had, and it's something I order a lot. It was this that first drew me to the restaurant and now I know why. Come here and try the ceviche (and a few other things) but the ceviche is a true must. I was with some ceviche unbelievers, and they have been reformed.  Oh, and then there is the world's greatest cheesecake. Just go and order it: if desserts could have start up equivalents, this would be the uber cheesecake. In that, it disrupts everything you ever thought cheesecake should be but now wonder what you did for dessert before this, how you thought a dried digestive base was acceptable when you can have this delight?  And the wine was good too.  So 10 out of 10 for the delicious foods, flavour, waiting staff and for making a Monday night mean something! Now I know I have to book, and I very much will. Until the next time Latasia!

Got there about 1.45pm not long after they had opened for lunch. Even although the restaurant is small to the extent of being poky and not really suitable for pushchairs they were able to squeeze us in leaving our pushchair next to the table. Alternatively, if it can fold they can look after it for you. Within 45 mins. the place had filled up with both locals and tourists. Restaurant has a good selection of pizzas and pastas with specials chalked up on a blackboard. We ordered a mixed bruschetta appetiser, followed by a Calzone pizza, which was excellent and my wife ordered one of the specials listed on the board which was salmon gnocchi which was equally as good as the pizza. Kids ate a nice olive oil focaccia bread. The staff are are all quite young, Italian (or at least they all speak Italian among themselves) and hip (think tattoos and earrings) and our waiter was friendly and accommodating.  Two days later decided to go back again for lunch but this time the ham and mushroom pizza my wife had was not as good and the lasagne that I ordered was good although not great. Neither was the tiramisu I had for desert - I can't put my finger on it but something was missing.

You may need to use your phone app to find it quickly. We arrived for a late lunch circa 15:30 and the place was nearly full and quite busy. It's a somewhat tiny space inside and we were fortunate to get the last rickety small table against the back wall. The wooden chairs seemed less than stable and were not the most comfortable, but we lost our concerns and ignored how warm it was in there within a few minutes of getting into our chilled bottle of albarino which was better than very good and of moderate priced. Our waiter was pleasant and nonintrusive. Despite somewhat cramped conditions and the hot afternoon, the place had a friendly feel to it and everyone appeared content in this local ambiance. I wouldn't exactly call this a tapas bar, but with great wine flowing through a circulatory system, any normal person wouldn't debate what to call the food. Several pizza choices were available, but we didn't come to Spain for pizza (perhaps my spouse did) and, thus, we didn't try the pizza. Our ""tapas"" choices turned out to be truly tasty (tostada de queso de cabra/goat cheese y espinacas/spinach, empanada de queso de cabra y cebolla/onion which was caramelized, and we shared a great ensalada racula/arugula). The table was too small to fit everything (an extra chair was provided that solved that problem), but we left satisfied since the portions were more than good-sized and the total bill was moderate and fair. We prefer another small ""hidden gem"" we've found in Madrid, but we'll likely return here some day and we do believe the overall experience is worth your visit.",2018-07-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d9740129-Reviews-or120-Tinto_y_Tapas-Madrid.html,UID_24395,0.037,0.795,0.167,0.9933,0.2182196969696969,0.4703787878787878,0.3289909090909091,1743,140,0.0803212851405622,0,49,False,54,0.0634920634920634,0.1587301587301587,0.3492063492063492,0.0317460317460317,0.1746031746031746,0.0158730158730158,0.0,0.0158730158730158,0.1428571428571428,0.0476190476190476,307,206,4.680781758957655,0,0,easi block walk atocha atocha renf metro station within area seem safe wander time may need use phone app find quickli arriv late lunch circa place nearli full quit busi somewhat tini space insid fortun get last ricketi small tabl back wall wooden chair seem less stabl comfort lost concern ignor warm within minut get chill bottl albarino better good moder price waiter pleasant nonintrus despit somewhat cramp condit hot afternoon place friendli feel everyon appear content local ambianc exactli call tapa bar great wine flow circulatori system normal person debat call food sever pizza choic avail come spain pizza perhap spous thu tri pizza tapa choic turn truli tasti tostada de queso de cabra goat chees espinaca spinach empanada de queso de cabra cebolla onion caramel share great ensalada racula arugula tabl small fit everyth extra chair provid solv problem left satisfi sinc portion good size total bill moder fair prefer anoth small hidden gem found madrid like return day believ overal experi worth visit,average review,3

This is quite possibly the best restaurant that serves ""authentic"" Italian food. We have visited Italy in the past, so we knew as soon as we tasted that first bite, that we were in an Italian heaven! The Chef, Gianni, was simply the most friendly, caring and loving human being! He truly showed personal interest in our satisfaction. It is very refreshing indeed to see the Chef himself be so involved, especially with tourists. I can understand that kind and generous behavior towards locals and/or regulars. But, Gianni made our dining experience absolutely wonderful and enthralling. I would love to suggest some of the F/B items from the menu, but I will say this...anything you try here at this lovely replica of Italian Hospitality, will be a winner.

I ordered daily menu for ‚Ç¨11,90 with 2 main courses (1 main course was something around ‚Ç¨8) and dessert included in menu. They had 3 dished to choose from. First meal I got was the third option that I actually didn't order :-) It looked good so I decided to keep the food. In fact it was the only meal I actually liked here so in the end I am happy I didn't return the meal. The second meal I couldn't finish... not because of the size of portion but because I just simply didn't like it. I am not a slow eater but I was already 1,5h (!!!) in the restaurant. It wasn't only because the restaurant was full during lunch time, it was especially because they ignored me a good half an hour. After those 30 min I had to call a waiter and ask if they could bring me a dessert which was just the fruits with a coffee cream that didn't even go well together... I could actually skip it. Instead of ‚Ç¨11,90 I paid ‚Ç¨18. I do not think that the water I had did cost ‚Ç¨6 also because in the receipt was written I had some additional menu. And if the water here truly cost ‚Ç¨6 than it's really overpriced. Spent here for 2 hours, came hungry and left hungry too. I recommend you to avoid this place. Not only you get something different that you order but the food is not good either.

The atmosphere was great, it's a small place and it was bustling. The dining style is fairly casual with high tables, people eating at the bar and regular tables but the food was very special. We ordered tapas and tried some local beers and had a really fun evening. We were visiting for our anniversary celebrations and the food served was definitely suitable for such an occasion. We shared croquettas, a really interesting green tomato salad, bruschettas and a few other bits. I'd definitely recommend a visit if you're over on that side of town. The staff spoke good English and were patient when my terrible Spanish was difficult to understand which I'm grateful for. My only criticism would be that the waitress who greeted us was quite rude about our booking, trying to turn us away. This was a bit of a poor start given we'd booked quite far in advance and said it was for an anniversary meal. I'm sure it was just because it was busy and they're only human after all.

The cafes/tapas bars in the square of the museum were ridiculously overpriced and looked less than appetizing. Checked out trip advisor and saw this highly rated place. We were NOT disappointed.

Walked into Tinto y Tapas II and we‚Äôre taken right to a table. The (new) waiter was kind, curteous, and very patient, he also spoke English beautifully!

It's a short walk from Puerta del Sol, down a bustling main street, and then a few blocks down a smaller (yet, still busy) street. The pizza is thin crust and the perfect size for 2 people to split. I was surprised at how delicious and flavorful it was! I'm from NYC, where there's a pizza place on every corner, and this place can go head to head with some of the best I've had. The restaurant is very quaint and cute, but small, so probably not great for large groups. My husband and I walked right in at around 9 pm on a Sunday night and were seated immediately. The waiters were extremely nice and accommodating, as I made a request to have half of the pizza plain and the other half ""diavola."" The diavola was so good and not too spicy--just right! The plain was perfect and the pizza sauce was sweet and delicious. We also started with the bruschetta, which I recommend as well.

It's a bit of a challenge to locate (as you just dont think that its in the street it is) and knocking on the door and waiting to be let into the restaurant is a little strange (but fun). The specialise in Patella (different pan for cooking paella) and it was delicious. Prior to the main dish, there was plenty of tapas etc. to try. The highlight was the 'bucket' of butter that you get with the 10 different varieties of pan (bread).  One downside is that you are squashed into a room with probably too many tables/chairs for the size of the place.

The rest was a huge disappointment. The service was unfriendly. We always had the feeling like they pushed us to buy more. Okay, selling food is there work, but they didn't give us time to choose properly from the menu (we took 5 minutes extra to translate the menu for some friends) and when the noticed that we would take some moments more, they started to treat us badly. The food got served quickly but they were not waiting till everyone had finished at the table to clear the table. We felt rushed all the time. With our glasses still half full, the waitress filled up our glasses to the top and then asked us if we wanted another one. That was just rude. In the end we didn't take any desert or coffee. We got handed our bill without having asked for it.  Also, we could see how someone, who looked like he had made a reservation, got turned away because the restaurante was full. Even with having a starter we lasted hardly 45 minutes in the restaurante. While we were expecting a nice dinner in an Italian restaurante, we got rushed to eat and to pay. Everything seems to be made to maximize the profit, which is okay, but you shouldn't make it feel the customer. If you want a good pizza in 20 minutes time, it's okay. If you want a nice evening, enjoying good food, you might wanna think of going somewhere else.

As I have noted in my reviews of restaurants that purport to be Italian, I hold them to the high standards of authentic Italian cooking (i.e., freshness and quality of ingredients, flavor, use of seasonings instead of over-use of salt, origin of cheeses, oils, etc.) and ambiance. The menu of this restaurant, like most Italian restaurants primarily serving pizza, is not extensive. It doesn‚Äôt need to be. The quality of the pizza is delicious. This cozy restaurant compares very favorably in all respects to the taste of pizza and modest and pasta dishes you would find in small towns in Italy. It reminds me of a place I used to frequent a few blocks from Termini Station in Rome in the 1990‚Äôs. Our meal was topped off with a complimentary shot of Limoncello. What a nice touch!  If you are staying in Chueca (the region of Madrid where Pizzaiolo is located) for a lengthy visit, there is an excellent and reasonably-price laundry a few doors away on the same side of Calle Hortaleza. If you plan accordingly, you can have your laundry done while at dinner- or do you can do in yourself. For Americans, the charge is for the load, not per piece as is customary in the USA. We found this helpful in spending our time more productively rather than sitting waiting for the laundry to be done.",2013-03-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1066464-Reviews-or140-Il_Pizzaiolo-Madrid.html,UID_30538,0.007,0.9,0.093,0.9699,0.2052173913043478,0.4581884057971014,0.3148692307692307,1385,126,0.0909747292418772,1,36,False,33,0.0967741935483871,0.1612903225806451,0.3548387096774194,0.032258064516129,0.1935483870967742,0.032258064516129,0.0,0.032258064516129,0.064516129032258,0.032258064516129,245,162,4.653061224489796,0,0,high standard fresh expect countri mediterranean region note review restaur purport italian hold high standard authent italian cook e fresh qualiti ingredi flavor use season instead use salt origin chees oil etc ambianc menu restaur like italian restaur primarili serv pizza extens need qualiti pizza delici cozi restaur compar favor respect tast pizza modest pasta dish would find small town itali remind place use frequent block termini station rome meal top complimentari shot limoncello nice touch stay chueca region madrid pizzaiolo locat lengthi visit excel reason price laundri door away side call hortaleza plan accordingli laundri done dinner american charg load per piec customari usa found help spend time product rather sit wait laundri done,very good review,5

We found the place easily and enjoyed the restaurant atmosphere. My husband ordered the prosciutto and fungi pizza and I ordered raviolis. I tried my husbands pizza and thought the dough was excellent however, the prosciutto is not prosciutto crudo as we anticipated. It's actually prosciutto cotto (cooked ham) which was a little disappointing from our perspective. If the effect is Neapolitan pizza, it was close but not truly that crisp southern Italian style pizza you experience in Naples. My ravioli portion was a bit small for the price but still good. We ordered the tiramisu and two coffees. Our small annoyance came when we went to pay the bill. Our bill was 35.53‚Ç¨ and we gave them 50‚Ç¨, so we expected to receive 14.47‚Ç¨ in return. We were shorted 10‚Ç¨. While the matter did get addressed, the resolution behavior warranted us to make readers/reviewers aware to check change and not be afraid to speak up (even as foreigners).

It's in a neighborhood to the north, far from where we were staying on the Paseo del Prado. Getting there by subway was a bit of an adventure, as the streets in the area are not well marked. Next time I'll spring for the taxi for simplicity.  Having found the restaurant, we were seated in the dining room, we were seated. The server was quick and attentive. The bread came with two olive oils and a balsamic vinaigrette. This was the first time I've been served olive oils where I could really taste the difference in them. Fantastic educational experience! We ordered several appetizers, and each was better than the last, finishing with a wonderful alcahofas con jamon y huevo. Now I understand the Spanish fixation on jamon Iberico. For the main course, we had the patella (paella) de arroz de pescado--seafood paella. This was my first opprtunity to try paella after hearing about it for years, and I found it excellent. It's the house specialty here, with the chef having designed custom pans to get the cooking characteristics he wants for the dish. The atmosphere was very nice, kind of low-key. The dining room is small, maybe 10 tables, so it never gets too loud. The dishes are all made for the restaurant. The service was perfect, attentive without being pushy. Overall, one of our best dining experiences in our 12 days in Spain.",2010-10-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991647-Reviews-or240-Casa_Benigna-Madrid.html,UID_30569,0.007,0.885,0.108,0.9808,0.3274999999999999,0.495679012345679,0.2544833333333333,1420,121,0.0852112676056338,1,43,False,58,0.1282051282051282,0.1538461538461538,0.358974358974359,0.0256410256410256,0.2564102564102564,0.0,0.0,0.0256410256410256,0.0512820512820512,0.0,250,170,4.68,0,0,pick casa benigna fodor guid last dinner spain neighborhood north far stay paseo del prado get subway bit adventur street area well mark next time spring taxi simplic found restaur seat dine room seat server quick attent bread came two oliv oil balsam vinaigrett first time serv oliv oil could realli tast differ fantast educ experi order sever appet better last finish wonder alcahofa con jamon huevo understand spanish fixat jamon iberico main cours patella paella de arroz de pescado seafood paella first opprtun tri paella hear year found excel hous specialti chef design custom pan get cook characterist want dish atmospher nice kind low key dine room small mayb tabl never get loud dish made restaur servic perfect attent without pushi overal one best dine experi day spain,good review,4

It was a plate of rice with some cauliflower and green beans! This is more than what you would pay for two fillet steaks at a posh place. A few other small items, two glasses of wine, and the bill came to over ‚Ç¨90. The food was totally average if not poor. They charge a ‚Ç¨6 cover and, for that, you get odd little bites like cold fried potato chips and crudites. There was a definite shellfish flavour off thr paella so that either came from the stock or the paella dish and we asked that it be totally vegetarian. The only wine they were prepared to serve by the glass was one type of rioja. The staff, who are all Fillipino, kept speaking English to my native Spanish-speaking companion. Indeed there was no Spanish to be heard as everyone in the dining room was a tourist/business traveller . It was all very surreal. Also the menu is, in my view, deliberately deceiving. Starters are priced per plate but the paella is priced per person - this is not made clear at all. If you want a jolly place (the waiters are friendly) to have an average, insanely expensive paella, I suppose this place will do, but do not expect an authentic or good dining experience. I'm frankly baffled by the glowing reviews to be found here which were the reason I had come to this place.",2019-01-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991647-Reviews-or20-Casa_Benigna-Madrid.html,UID_335,0.04,0.885,0.075,0.8944,-0.0208333333333333,0.5177536231884057,0.3687333333333332,1364,128,0.093841642228739,1,33,False,47,0.0980392156862745,0.1764705882352941,0.2549019607843137,0.0392156862745098,0.2745098039215686,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0980392156862745,0.0196078431372549,257,175,4.311284046692607,0,0,companion vegetarian paella two came crazi plate rice cauliflow green bean would pay two fillet steak posh place small item two glass wine bill came food total averag poor charg cover get odd littl bite like cold fri potato chip crudit definit shellfish flavour thr paella either came stock paella dish ask total vegetarian wine prepar serv glass one type rioja staff fillipino kept speak english nativ spanish speak companion inde spanish heard everyon dine room tourist busi travel surreal also menu view deliber deceiv starter price per plate paella price per person made clear want jolli place waiter friendli averag insan expens paella suppos place expect authent good dine experi frankli baffl glow review found reason come place,average review,3

My husband and I just returned from a 17 day vacation in Spain. We had reservations for Casa Benigna one evening but got our days mixed up and arrived on the wrong day. The staff could not have been nicer and although they were fully booked, they accommodated us by letting us eat in a special room off the kitchen. They even invited us to watch them prepare the food. The owner Umberto came in to talk to us as well. And to top it off, it was by far the best paella we have ever tasted. And when we left, there was a hand written note from Umberto thanking us for coming along with a special surprise that we will never forget.

We love craft beer and Madrid has a decent selection of craft beer spots, but this place suits us the best. The owners are very friendly, they speak excellent English, and are willing to help in any way. The atmosphere is relaxing and just a great place to enjoy great beer and meet beer fans from around the world, many of them English speaking. There are 7 beers on tap, always rotating, but they make sure there is something for all styles available. If you don't like what's on tap, there is an excellent cold bottle/can selection. I am more of an IPA fan and there has been a consistently new selection of bottles to choose from. This is also a great place to buy beer to go and they sell gift packs, like an Advent Calendar of Beer for the holidays (which we loved).
