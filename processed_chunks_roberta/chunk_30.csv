End of the day the chef Diego Guerroro focus appears to be about the food. The message a silent revolution printed on potatoe paper served with a peanut/pepper mousse starts the degustation adventure. Our waitress Zulema Matas and Sommelier Javiar Barroso enhanced the 3 hour sensory experience. Reviews prior to this have gone through the various dishes. To repeat, each were an experience in itself. At 250 for 2 people with 3 glasses of wine each and a 12 course degustation over 3 hours, I would consider it value for money.

I don't know if the menus is any cheaper (70EU pp for a pri fixe menu), but we were the only people there for the first our of our meal and it was a privilege. The service was amazing - even though we speak no Spanish - the staff tried so hard to answer our questions and explain each dish. The chef himself - Diego Guererro - came to our table twice to check on us. Truly he came across as a tortured artist - a slave to his creations. He really took pleasure in our enjoyment of the meal. We later saw the press releases and realized he's quite the celebrity and could have been arrogant as he wanted he's famous for his creations. And they are creations! This is the first meal I recall taking a photo of every course served just because I felt words alone could not describe what we were eating. If I could go back and take my kids (Tweens & teens who will eat anything - there's obviously not a kids' menu here), I would and just starve the rest of the trip with no money left for food. His creations are pure magic.

Set in a beautiful building with the door to the restaurant hidden inside on the ground floor. Once inside, this restaurant has a small dining room with white table cloths black medallion chairs, brass chandeliers and black and white photographs all of which exude quiet and relaxed elegance. The menu comes in short, medium and long, and you can inform (when you book ahead) if you have any special food allergies. No formal dress code is required but a casual elegant outfit would be best suitable to the atmosphere and the usual clientele. As for food, few michelin chefs can do well in both main courses and also dessert. Chef Diego on the other hand exceeds all expectations. In a very light-hearted Spanish style, every dish is humbly presented with a cheeky humor and so much creative thinking that makes you smile at your food. The trouble Chef Diego goes through to get the right touch and the right taste is just impeccable.  Also do bring a camera, you will regret not to.

Otherwise the staff was helpful and kind, felt just a bit stressed. A positive thing was that the chef came to check in the end of the dinner if we liked the food.

When we arrived we were ushered to a private table of 5 by a staff of multiple attentive employees. The lack of ambiance was surprising - bright room, antique feel, no warmth or background music to set the mood.  Our staff was plentiful however in my opinion, couldn't have been more unprofessional. They seemed to be hovering too much without knowing how and when to be helpful. We had to ask a couple of times to refill water (even though they were there) and when we were making a private family toast one of the waiters literally interrupted us to ask a question!  Since this is a tasting menu we wanted to order wine that complimented our dishes. Aside from the waiters, the wine ""expert"" was not able to guide us. Most of us speak English and surprisingly none of the waiters could answer our questions. We were hoping to at least find out if there was meat being served so that we could order a red wine. Instead we were pointed to a white during meat courses. Our expectation in a fine restaurant in a major city is that the staff has a good grasp of the English language.  The food was absolutely delicious as one would expect from a highly priced tasting menu. It was beautifully presented , creative and very fresh. We ordered the 10 course meal and the number of starters ,main dishes and desserts were just right. Again one would expect the food to be paced out nicely, but the first few courses were being served too quickly one after the other. We had to ask them to slow down the pace.

But if you had read the prior reviews and praises on Tripadvisor, you would have come with high expectations. El Club Allard met ours, and therefore is worthy of commendation, but it did not wow us with a truly two-star Michelin experience (as Dstage did but with its one star). Food - innovative and artistically presented There is no doubt much thought had been painstakingly poured into the design of the courses (we went for the 12), but the dishes looked so effortlessly chic each of them could have been an art piece. Interestingly the presentation outperformed the taste (presentation 8.5, taste around 8). Wine - good, but sommelier dispensed with the banter Service - decent, seems like it is not in the nature of El Club Allard to make much small talk to its customers. And hence the business lunch vibe. Verdict - come but go to Dstage first. Or no, if you have time, come to El Club Allard first for a nice meal and then be transported into space by Dstage.",2016-03-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or110-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_24338,0.018,0.778,0.204,0.9908,0.2671929824561403,0.6143859649122807,0.3511625,1111,87,0.0783078307830783,0,33,False,35,0.1515151515151515,0.1212121212121212,0.2727272727272727,0.0606060606060606,0.2121212121212121,0.0,0.0303030303030303,0.0303030303030303,0.0606060606060606,0.0606060606060606,198,130,4.616161616161616,0,0,el club allard excel classi ambienc classi exterior interior design food thought modern fine read prior review prais tripadvisor would come high expect el club allard met therefor worthi commend wow us truli two star michelin experi dstage one star food innov artist present doubt much thought painstakingli pour design cours went dish look effortlessli chic could art piec interestingli present outperform tast present tast around wine good sommeli dispens banter servic decent seem like natur el club allard make much small talk custom henc busi lunch vibe verdict come go dstage first time come el club allard first nice meal transport space dstage,good review,4

The attention to the details and the special mix of japanese traditional and spanish ingredients and taste make Miyama a must.

My take is a bit more moderate after trying it out: I did find the quality of the material to be excellent , but I was let down by the ""diner style "" booths and the excessive light in the restaurant for dinner time. Perhaps my idea of ""dinner"" is linked to a more atmospheric ambience which I did not find. Perhaps it may be a restaurant to try for lunch rather than dinner?  The service was excellent and some of the presentations of the dishes as well.

First, we waited outside of the hotel in a line. Then, we were finally brought upstairs to another line.

We’re sitting there for at least 15 mins, and notice that not only has no one come to take our drink order, but literally one table out of all the tables there had actual drinks. We waited probably 20 mins for a person to come and ask what we want to drink. Mind you, there is no music or anything at this establishment, so you’re all just sitting there. After the guy takes our drink order, it took at least another 10 mins to get the two drinks. While waiting, and while sipping our drinks, various people were being called to go and sit outside - including people who had just say and people who had gotten there long after we did. We finally had to ask the guy why we were being sat outside and he just kind of laughed it off. About 10 mins later we get sat outside. Not a single person came to ask how we were doing on drinks or for us to able to order another. We finished our first drinks and left. Total waste of time. There are so many bars in the area.

Well, after about 15 mins wait at the lobby some came and invied us with another couple to the elevator. we go in just to find that he went to talk to someone in the lobby living us in a small elevator to wait (you need a card to go up so we had to wait for him). after few minutes the guy from reception saw us there so he rushed, apologized and swiped his card to set us free. we arrived to the top floor, wondered through the hotel corridor (remind me not to be a gust in this hotel staying on the top floor with constant traffic out the corridor) and arrived to the bar. it was a bit cold outside so we preferred to sit inside.  we truly hoped to be able to sit outside and enjoy the view, but for some reason there is no cover outside, and if you don't love being cold you have to sit ON the heater or you will have to sit inside the ""couches"" (cubic white things) were not very comfortable. the cocktail list was short, based on some classics with no innovation, nothing inspiring, nothing like trendy innovative cocktail bars with professional barmen. And then we realized - there was no music. nothing. have you ever visited a cocktail bar, a roof-top bar without background music? for me it was the first time ever and it was so weird. eventually we finished our boring drinks, paid our bill and left after about 30 mins. the views are nice, nothing exceptional.

I was trying to decide what to do for supper and thought this place might be an interesting alternative to being lazy and eating in the hotel. I was so glad I made the effort. Its a small place but by Spanish standards I was early and sat down as the only diner at 19.00. The staff were very friendly, helpful and found me a menu written in English. They also quickly found me a large glass of house Rijoca which I very much enjoyed while I scanned the menu. I ended up trying to order loads of different tapas and my waiter respectfully suggested I ordered half of the things I was considering and then made a call based on whether I had room to eat any more! Great advice. I tried loads of things I've never eaten before and some that I have. I'm a real sucker for croquettes and there were three variations on offer. The chefs special was good but the one with chunks of Iberico ham were my favourite. Nice friendly atmosphere, helpful and attentive staff and great food. I will certainly swing by again the next time I'm in town.",2018-09-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2314348-Reviews-Taberna_Degusta-Madrid.html,UID_26170,0.024,0.752,0.224,0.9951,0.2338151927437641,0.5670351473922902,0.5082083333333334,1117,108,0.0966875559534467,1,19,False,48,0.12,0.22,0.34,0.02,0.22,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.0,213,142,4.248826291079812,0,0,stay nh hotel around corner littl gem tri decid supper thought place might interest altern lazi eat hotel glad made effort small place spanish standard earli sat diner staff friendli help found menu written english also quickli found larg glass hous rijoca much enjoy scan menu end tri order load differ tapa waiter respect suggest order half thing consid made call base whether room eat great advic tri load thing never eaten real sucker croquett three variat offer chef special good one chunk iberico ham favourit nice friendli atmospher help attent staff great food certainli swing next time town,very good review,5

The flavours of the sauces were very similar so all in all, I was quite disappointed. The rest of the group tried to argue that the flavour would be different as we aren't in England. My reply was, if the chef is any good, indian food should have the appropriate flavours depending on what is being ordered. Same tasting food is just a sign that the chef is probably just using the same base sauce. Service; was very good. Drinks were always topped up or we were asked if we wanted anything else.

After 20min the food arrived, there was some average sushi (3 kinds of maki) which one had to serve with a fork due to the absence of any proper cutlery, soya sauce wouldn't be available till 30min later, there was also a pitcher with a tasty gazpacho but no cups to pour it. Some tomato and mozzarella sticks, good jamon, and a mayo and pasta salad. No bread or butter, eggs, marmelade, assorted cheese or anything resembling as a brunch menu. The staff seemed a bit lost without any idea of what and when would be served, after I asked if that was all the food available in brunch buffet if there was any bread at all and if they started to serve brunches today they told me that bread would come as well as a variety of warm dishes and desserts and that beforehand they had a good catering company providing the food and since 2 or 3 days they were being catered by the restaurant downstairs - Paris Tokyo. We noticed they were complaining to get more food from downstairs and 15min later they brought some chicken teriyaki and rice, was not bad, and some basic Spanish croquetas, that was it, the desserts were mere fruit sticks. With 2 drinks,included this would be 25eur each for what is sold as a brunch and it seems more like give the customers some whatever food while they pay for the views.. So between the bad food, clueless service and the dirty pool, the views didn't seem that impressive anymore. I used to find the concept of the room mate hotels quite nice, now i can pretty much say that they will never see me as a customer again and the same for the presumptuous restaurant downstairs..

The place is run well and you have to make reservations during the weekends. I liked everything that I had so far at this place. The best starter is the Paneer Till Sizzler. The Paneer is neither too soft nor too hard. If you are not a big fan of the paneer then you can try the Pakora which is very good. The chutneys go with both of these dishes. The Biriyani was the first main course that I had here which was very nice and very filling too. We can have it done very spicy or medium hot. I guess the latter was better. The Naans and the Rotis will always have butter on them, so if you want to avoid butter please tell them. The Raita at this place was the best as they let you choose the vegetables that goes in them :) The Vegetable kofta was obviously the best side dish at this place. Their speciality was the Malai kofta, but I was not a big fan of it because they had coconut in it which tasted a little odd. The service is very unique and personal here than at the other restaurants which is a big plus.",2015-09-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3537317-Reviews-or50-Restaurante_Sagar-Madrid.html,UID_23094,0.032,0.873,0.095,0.8857,0.2633333333333333,0.4528571428571428,0.4807692307692308,1149,135,0.1174934725848564,0,18,False,35,0.0714285714285714,0.0714285714285714,0.2142857142857142,0.2142857142857142,0.2142857142857142,0.0714285714285714,0.0,0.0714285714285714,0.0714285714285714,0.0,232,134,3.956896551724138,0,0,place nearli thrice week intend go anoth time last week stay place run well make reserv weekend like everyth far place best starter paneer till sizzler paneer neither soft hard big fan paneer tri pakora good chutney go dish biriyani first main cours nice fill done spici medium hot guess latter better naan roti alway butter want avoid butter pleas tell raita place best let choos veget goe veget kofta obvious best side dish place special malai kofta big fan coconut tast littl odd servic uniqu person restaur big plu,very good review,5

Bring a few friends or even just yourself to sit back and have a drink and a good chat over some delicious tapa style dishes.  The menu is nice over dishes for a range of budgets. But a nice tinto de verano and one of the several mini tortillas will only set you back about 5-6 euros. A nice preliminary tapa (mine was smoked salmon on French bread pieces) started us off.  I tried two of the tortillas, a 1/2 ration of huevos rotos de corral con trufa, and for dessert, the brownie casero.  Everything is displayed nicely and brought out piping hot.  There is also a flat screen displaying tantalizing photos of all the dishes offered in the restaurant. (A very nice touch)  I enjoyed and will be returning.

And this particular venue fits the bill quite well :) There isn't going to be much to say about the food, since we didn't eat there, only drank a substantial amour of funny liquids in all sorts of strange and wondrous glasses. A few words about the setting first. Getting in might be a hassle since they have a limited amount of tables, so the best bet, and now I know as well is to book a table. The terrace is situated on the last floor of a trendy hotel in Madrid's thriving gay quarter (so all of you who are offended by that, stay clear... all the better for the rest of us who enjoy a good view and great drinks, but enough said on that). Not that it matters, or that anything suspicious is going on up there. It's a open space with a pool in the middle, a bar, great, views over the center of the old city. Only the terrace of the cercle of arts has a better view (because it's 360). Oscar's ""only"" 3/4 of the view, the bar is the way. And one could argue that fact since the terrace is not a rectangle. But I digress. The view is just great, we had the sun going down on north, the city turning to the nightlife mode on the south and we where decking it out on the pool. (it as empty for repairs though) music was playing the back ground, and the temperature was just about right for sipping a cold delicious cocktail. So what about those cocktails. Well tried the flame en co' which I misread. imagine a bloody mary where you change mary by maria y flamethrower y conception OLE! It's like a everything great spain has to offer thrown at you by a ranging bull. Some of you won't like it. I started by hating it. then after 3 sips, you sort of finally get it. then it hits you, layer after layer of flavours and all that complexity tells you: yes , this is the cocktail for connaisseurs, this is the one which finally gets you to understand the way of the shaker. The other thing was some sort of mad layered thing with mango in it which everybody seemed to enjoy. a lot sweeter than expected though.  In all with craft cocktail in hand, pool filled and a good DJ this particular rooftop bar is one of the best in madrid!",2018-06-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4475255-Reviews-or30-La_Terraza_de_Oscar-Madrid.html,UID_26289,0.064,0.778,0.158,0.9936,0.2181810819565922,0.542800453514739,0.513904347826087,2253,215,0.0954283177984909,3,69,False,67,0.1212121212121212,0.1313131313131313,0.2424242424242424,0.0505050505050505,0.1212121212121212,0.0909090909090909,0.0404040404040404,0.0303030303030303,0.1212121212121212,0.0505050505050505,433,257,4.203233256351039,0,0,greet madrid escapad need special discoveri make go back spain capit press particular venu fit bill quit well go much say food sinc eat drank substanti amour funni liquid sort strang wondrou glass word set first get might hassl sinc limit amount tabl best bet know well book tabl terrac situat last floor trendi hotel madrid thrive gay quarter offend stay clear better rest us enjoy good view great drink enough said matter anyth suspici go open space pool middl bar great view center old citi terrac cercl art better view oscar view bar way one could argu fact sinc terrac rectangl digress view great sun go north citi turn nightlif mode south deck pool empti repair though music play back ground temperatur right sip cold delici cocktail cocktail well tri flame en co misread imagin bloodi mari chang mari maria flamethrow concept ole like everyth great spain offer thrown rang bull like start hate sip sort final get hit layer layer flavour complex tell ye cocktail connaisseur one final get understand way shaker thing sort mad layer thing mango everybodi seem enjoy lot sweeter expect though craft cocktail hand pool fill good dj particular rooftop bar one best madrid,good review,4

My wife being a strict vegetarian it was important that we find a good Indian restaurant that would fit the bill and satisfy her craving for some good Indian food. We found Restaurant Sagar on Google Maps. With some help from our hotel's concierge and a couple of phone calls to the restaurant an hour or so later at 12.30 pm on Aug 20 our taxi brought us to the doors of Sagar. Getting out we saw a lady at the door welcoming us in the traditional Indian way with a Namaste. Enter and you find this cozy ambiance. Very colorful but without the carved furniture that you see in many other Indian restaurants. The lady who was the owner introduced herself as Jaya and seated us at our tableThe waiter brought us menus and in the next over an hour we had the most satisfying Indian vegetarian lunch with garlic nan, aloo parathas, raita, malai kofta (unlike we have had anywhere before) complete with papads, gulab jamus, gajar halwa. All the food items were delicious and the conversation with the owner was interesting. As we sat and ate, the place started to fill up and we witnessed their service in action with all diners enjoying their experience there. At the end of the meal I was offered excellent liqueur that was chilled with chilled shot glasses to drink it from. We did not get a chance to return as we were busy with our explorations of Madrid and towns around the next four days. But if we return to Madrid, Sagar Restaurant will be definitely the place we will have some meals.

There weren't enough tables so we sat at the bar. I counted about 7 waiters, but they all seemed too busy cleaning glasses to serve us. 2 beers cost 12 euros and came with a very small bowl of mixed nuts. For this price you would expect everything to be top notch. There are 2 lifts going up to the rooftop terrace, but one was broken so it took ages waiting for the other one to arrive and only 4 people fit inside at a time. In the ladies toilets there are 2 sinks. One was broken - no water came out of the tap. There are about 4-5 toilets. 2 had no toilet paper and the lock was broken on another.

Whilst some may think that it is pricey (20 euros for three hours) I think is a good value and a beautiful escape from the hustle and bustle of the centre of Madrid.  For 20 euros, you can choose a day time slot to spend by the pool and use its facilities (12-3pm or 3.30-6.30pm), the price includes a complimentary glass of cava OR a bottle of water, towels, comfortable sun beds, use of the pool and changing rooms/showers etc and a locker! The terraza boasts views of the beautiful city whilst being a calming and relaxing place to unwind! Bar drinks are surprisingly not expensive and the waiters (who speak Spanish and very good English) are very friendly.  One thing I would say is, AVOID the food!

Reached at around 9:30 pm and the first impression was that there must be something special about this place. It was the first indian restaurant which was completely packed. We generally eat at around 8 pm and we were late due to a regional train delay. It could probably be because of the timing. We were asked to wait for 15 minutes. There were people who came after us but were given seats as they had prior reservations. It made sense and felt genuine. We waited for almost an hour (had not eaten indian food in a long time and hence the desperation) and then decided to order takeaway. There were two more couples who came after us but were given seats. Cant really say that they had reservations but it felt like we were being ignored. It was probably because the owner realized we were tourists who dont drink compared to locals who would be more valuable customers. We dont drink and tend to eat vegetarian main courses only. There were tables which were empty and one more group of 3 locals were immediately given a seat. That was the tipping point. Took the takeaway and the lady waived off charges for the dessert we had while waiting for over 1.5 hours. It was too little too late and i must say that we have never really felt insulted like this. It may have been the right decision from a commercial standpoint but left us really frustrated. Had vegetarian curry and nan. The food was average and could be rated at 3/5. Minus 2 for the bad experience. My advice - Try and make a reservations - If its packed and you are a tourist without a reservation, then you need to cross your fingers - Would anyday prefer to eat indian food at a restaurant that dosent require waiting compared to one that requires such a long wait even if the quality is much better",2015-01-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3537317-Reviews-or60-Restaurante_Sagar-Madrid.html,UID_26355,0.062,0.871,0.067,-0.0368,0.053031994047619,0.3952752976190475,0.4147999999999999,1867,160,0.0856989823245849,0,31,False,77,0.1228070175438596,0.0701754385964912,0.2807017543859649,0.0,0.1228070175438596,0.0701754385964912,0.0350877192982456,0.0526315789473684,0.1578947368421052,0.087719298245614,343,197,4.446064139941691,0,0,went restaur base review tripadvisor top rate indian restaur reach around pm first impress must someth special place first indian restaur complet pack gener eat around pm late due region train delay could probabl time ask wait minut peopl came us given seat prior reserv made sens felt genuin wait almost hour eaten indian food long time henc desper decid order takeaway two coupl came us given seat cant realli say reserv felt like ignor probabl owner realiz tourist dont drink compar local would valuabl custom dont drink tend eat vegetarian main cours tabl empti one group local immedi given seat tip point took takeaway ladi waiv charg dessert wait hour littl late must say never realli felt insult like may right decis commerci standpoint left us realli frustrat vegetarian curri nan food averag could rate minu bad experi advic tri make reserv pack tourist without reserv need cross finger would anyday prefer eat indian food restaur dosent requir wait compar one requir long wait even qualiti much better,average review,3

We've even tried this restaurant a few years ago in its previous form before it was given a makeover by the Spanish TV's version of 'Kitchen Nightmares' and it was passable at the time but we never went back. But now - what a surpirise! What a fantastic improvement! Cosy interior with bright, vibrant colours; great atmosphere; superb service; and above all the food was delicious. Some of the best curries we've ever had in Spain without a shadow of a doubt. The owner was extremely attentive and helpful, making some recommendations from the menu that were spot on - nothing too spicy for the kids, something with good bite for us, etc. The rest of the staff were very professional and pleasant too. Don't be put off by its location - make the effort to go there if you want an incredible curry in a super setting - you won't be disappointed at all. Real life proof that these makeover shows on TV can and do make a big difference.

The owner is very nice, she is always smiling and asking you if everything is ok.  The food portion is not big, but when it is inside your stomach, you feel stuffed immediately. Indu food for me is like once every 3 months, if I don't eat curry, I definitely miss it within 3 months. However, if I eat it every week, I would get bored.  The service is quick and there is a couple of times, the waiters seemed to be in a hurry to close the place even when we were having our desserts and finishing the drinks. This is rude as they have a timetable pointing out the opening hours, and we respected it, but they didn't repect us.  In any case, the food is excellent. After trying almost everything from the carte, I personally recommend curry chicken (it's not that I'm boring or a classic, it's because they really do good curry chicken.) Creamy sauce, authentic curry taste and tender chicken. Vegies and cheese balls is also a must. Then if you are starving, you can also ask for a deep fried starter. For drinking I like the salty lassie. Don't forget to ask cheese or garlic Nan/ rice for the wonderful curry sauce, I promise there will be none left in your plate. Mango jelly and ice cream is funny, they made the jelly like small ice cube shape and put them as topping of the ice cream.

The reviews excited us even more and expectations went even higher when we went on Thu evening and found it to be full house. We booked a reservation for Fri and were unfortunately left disappointed both with the food and service. Lets start with the food - I get that its not so easy to make creative dishes for vegans but at least the dishes should look appetizing. Most things we ordered looked dull and insipid. As for taste - Starters of pate's with bread was reasonably good. The main courses - risotto was tasty, the tacos decent, the zucchini lasagna passable and the enchiladas inedible (bitter). The highlight of our meal was the blueberry cheesecake which was light and perfect. Now service - there was only 1 waitress for a full restaurant and we felt quite sorry for her as she looked harrowed and kept forgetting orders. I don't blame her at all, they need to improve staffing levels. For a meal of 4, we paid close to 70 Euros including a glass of wine & 2 beers. so pricing is not so high, but food was lackadaisal!",2017-08-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10501304-Reviews-or80-La_Encomienda-Madrid.html,UID_26371,0.08,0.816,0.104,0.7607,0.2014285714285714,0.6123619047619048,0.7155,1141,93,0.0815074496056091,1,26,False,45,0.1020408163265306,0.1632653061224489,0.3061224489795918,0.0408163265306122,0.1632653061224489,0.0408163265306122,0.0408163265306122,0.0,0.1020408163265306,0.0408163265306122,207,143,4.516908212560386,0,0,vegetarian quit thrill see restaur right across short stay apart madrid review excit us even expect went even higher went thu even found full hous book reserv fri unfortun left disappoint food servic let start food get easi make creativ dish vegan least dish look appet thing order look dull insipid tast starter pate bread reason good main cours risotto tasti taco decent zucchini lasagna passabl enchilada ined bitter highlight meal blueberri cheesecak light perfect servic waitress full restaur felt quit sorri look harrow kept forget order blame need improv staf level meal paid close euro includ glass wine beer price high food lackadais,bad review,2

The food is very close to authentic Indian food and the owner has always been on hand the past 3 times I visited this place for dinner. The service staff is not that great and could do with a few lessons on basic manners as well as customer service. The desserts are not that great and not at all recommended but the appetizer offerings are extensive than what I had expected.  A couple of visits have made it clear that most of the business is due to the takeaways due to the number of delivery websites the place has tied up with.

The fried eggplant was a tasteless weird dish. We couldn't eat, therefore the restaurant guy changed the dish and didn't charge us the price for that dish (have to admit that was a nice gesture).

It was tasty however the ears were sliced in thin pieces which made it very difficult to eat with the cartilege on thin strips and a thin layer of meat - became a pain to eat.

Quite simply, we love the place! We love the food, the wine, the atmosphere and the staff. It doesn't matter how many months between our visits to Madrid, we are always welcomed cordially, the food is excellent and freshly cooked to order and the wine goes down a treat. There is always an interesting mixture of regulars in and out of Casa Toni as well as tourists following some book or You tube recommendation and even groups of people doing a Madrid tapas tours. We often get chatting to other customers from different countries and spend delightful evenings with good food, good wine, good company and good service in vibrant surroundings. My particular favourite dish is the Mollejas but my husband is vegetarian so I always order a half portion. His favourite dish is the Berenejas - griddled aubergine (i.e. egg plant) drizzled with honey and I certainly share that with him. We always order patatas alioi and patatas bravas too.

We ordered the butter chicken, which was very good and a larger portion than expected. We asked for spicy, but it was still probably medium. We also ordered the malai chicken tikka, which on the other hand wasn’t very good at all. It arrived cold on a sizzling dish and wasn’t very visually appetizing. The chicken chunks were too big and appeared as if the yogurt and seasoning were applied after the chicken was cooked. To note, it is all white meat chicken. We have high standards for Indian restaurants since we are of that background. The manager definitely was hospitable and offered us complementary dessert. They strictly follow the reservation policy, so make sure to make one. The decor is just average and it was a little out of the way for us.  We left satisfied, but weren’t by any means blown away.

We didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant was almost empty and they were able to seat us.  We ordered some wine which was served with a small sweet potato mash tapa - it was delicious. We ordered some croquettes to start. There were six (two different types), spinach and blue cheese and potato and black garlic, served with a mustard sauce. I preferred the potato and black garlic ones. The blue cheese ones tasted a little funny to me, probably because I generally don't like vegan cheeses. We really liked the mustard sauce.  My friend ordered the burger and I had the tacos. I enjoyed the tacos immensely and the quantity was satisfying, but I still wished for a little bit more. The burger was okay. Definitely a bigger portion than the tacos, but maybe not as tasty. We ordered a berry cheesecake for dessert to share. I liked the berry sauce but not the cheesecake. It tasted a little too artificial for me, however, my friend really liked it.  Overall, we had a pleasant experience at La Encomienda. The food was good, service was excellent, and I personally enjoy supporting vegan establishments. I have yet to return here. Mostly because I do not live or work in the area.  I can recommend this place to vegans - especially raw vegans because there are lots of raw options.

Obvious the unusual organs got us interested and we decided to stop by for a little bite (literally we didn't plan to eat more than 1/4 of a plate to save our stomachs for the ""real dinner""). We were there early so it was not packed yet. Service was very friendly even though we couldn't speak spanish. The sangria was excellent. Despite our request to give us smaller portions for the same price, the portions were good. The fried anchovies were good. But the pigs ear was to die for. I've never had such good plate of pigs ear and don't think my chances are good finding another as good as this in the future. I took a chance and tried the kidneys and it was excellent too, no odor. Should have just decided to sit down and get the dinner done there, since we finished the whole plate of pig's ear and half of the other two. Obviously our dinner paled in comparison to this.

We tried 16 other tapas Bars around Madrid and this one made us come back for more! As others stated the food is fresh cooked to order all home made recipies. Staff does not speak English but are very friendly and can figure out menue with little help.  We had Garlic Shrimp , Sweetbread(lamb neck glands), Serrano peppers(not spicy sort of like a very mild green pepper that is grilled with coarse salt), Cooked to order mushrooms in sauce, anchovies marinated and anchovies whole deep fried.   The primary reason we went back 2nd time was for the Lamb neck glands(does not look like much) but is HEAVEN ON A PLATE. The Garlic shrimp were exquisite piping hot with amazing flavor best we had in Madrid. Mushrooms were great flavor and we liked the Serrano peppers here the best. They provide free bread to soak up the juices left over on our plates. You get free tapas (green olives) when you order a beer or vermouth. They also give you a shot glass of wine for free with your check, that is a great touch. They know how to take care of their customers and bring them back.  Place can get busy if you go at Spanish diner hour at 8-9 pm might be standing room only. We were there at 7PM (when they re-open for dinner) place was empty and was HEAVING when we left at 8. Casa Toni was the highlight of our Tapas experience in Madrid. Very reasonably priced nothing over 8 Euros. There is no place else where you can go on a culinary adventure in one small venue. The food is FANTASTIC!  Absolutely, should be put on your tapas crawl through Madrid. Does not get any more reasonable friendly and crazy good than Casa Toni. This should be #1 place on TA for Madrid Yes, you can find unique huge dinners with suckling lamb or pig for 100 euro a pop around Madrid (But that made us feel guilty) or you can Tapas crawl to at least 5 places for same price in this neighborhood... enjoy culture and people as you stroll the ever so safe district.

Got the lift straight up the rooftop to find that there were no seats so we got a drink and sat at the bar until a space became available. Which wasn't very long. Staff were attentive and welcoming.

Because I would like to give a full and detailed description of my experience.  The first time I went to Oscar I was quite delighted by my experience, it was a hot day and my boyfriend and I had always wanted to go. As soon as we got to the hotel we were greeted by the reception staff, we were asked by the lobby concierge as to where we were going. He was absolutely adorable and full of smiles, I forgot to take his name but you would spot him immediately with his huge smile and talkative personality. Once we actually got to the bar it was quite refreshing, to find a place that could've potentially been very ""snooty and pretentious"" if need be. But Oscar is not like that, it's quite multilayered.Upon entering we went straight to the bar, this will probably be the only real"" negative"" I will have about this place. But once at the bar, no one really greeted or acknowledged us, now maybe this bothered me more due to having worked in the service industry before, where customer acknowledgement was very important. There were about six or seven bar staff behind the bar and even though it was busy a simple hello, would of sufficed. I found one staff member, dressed like the rest with his little earpiece to be more aware of his looks than the customers. Eventually when someone paid us some attention it was all smooth sailing after that. We met a lovely waiter called Antonio, he's been mentioned quite abit and that is probably due to his naturally kind and approachable waitering style which seems genuine. Since then, I have been back quite often, taking friends and colleagues and my opinion about him has been reinforced. He is one of the waiters who was quite helpful and very attentive. I feel the rest smile when they serve you but once gone, eye contact is hard to find. At the end of the day it's a bar! A rather pricey one, not the most expensive but definitely pricey, It's not a modeling show! So all those really tense, Zoolander don't talk to me, I'm busy making a cocktail type waiters need a chill pill!!  Other than that it's a really lovely place, It is the type of place where you would find all walks of life. I love that you can find mature, young, thin, white, brown all types, so it makes it pleasurable. The cocktails are delicious and really well made, I love the fact that you can ask the waiters to make it ""stronger"" if you happen to be a ""social drinker"" like myself:) they happily oblige.  I do think management should think about repriceing their table charge or bottle charge, €150 for a bottle is borderline greed, I know, salaries,rent and whatnot but that's merely my opinion on that!  I would recommend this bar to any and everyone! It's fabulous and the music is great! what a really Ibiza like stomping grounds to have in good old Chuecs!! And look out for Antonio he'll really complete your experience.",2015-07-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4475255-Reviews-or130-La_Terraza_de_Oscar-Madrid.html,UID_26457,0.036,0.773,0.191,0.9986,0.2023252688172042,0.5382872503840246,0.5000800000000001,2913,262,0.0899416409200137,10,81,False,111,0.0891089108910891,0.1782178217821782,0.3465346534653465,0.0693069306930693,0.198019801980198,0.0198019801980198,0.0099009900990099,0.0,0.0495049504950495,0.0396039603960396,531,298,4.480225988700565,0,0,actual taken minut think bar would like give full detail descript experi first time went oscar quit delight experi hot day boyfriend alway want go soon got hotel greet recept staff ask lobbi concierg go absolut ador full smile forgot take name would spot immedi huge smile talk person actual got bar quit refresh find place could potenti snooti pretenti need oscar like quit multilay upon enter went straight bar probabl real neg place bar one realli greet acknowledg us mayb bother due work servic industri custom acknowledg import six seven bar staff behind bar even though busi simpl hello would suffic found one staff member dress like rest littl earpiec awar look custom eventu someon paid us attent smooth sail met love waiter call antonio mention quit abit probabl due natur kind approach waiter style seem genuin sinc back quit often take friend colleagu opinion reinforc one waiter quit help attent feel rest smile serv gone eye contact hard find end day bar rather pricey one expens definit pricey model show realli tens zooland talk busi make cocktail type waiter need chill pill realli love place type place would find walk life love find matur young thin white brown type make pleasur cocktail delici realli well made love fact ask waiter make stronger happen social drinker like happili oblig think manag think repric tabl charg bottl charg bottl borderlin greed know salari rent whatnot mere opinion would recommend bar everyon fabul music great realli ibiza like stomp ground good old chuec look antonio realli complet experi,average review,3

The displays of various foods on offer in the front window 1st attracted us. Various types of mushrooms, seafood, meats and offal, which a bit keen on I must say. We looked inside and saw a modest crowd of only locals, with room for us at the bar. We were welcomed with pleasant greetings not usually offered tourists and sat down to enjoy some of the best Tapas we've experienced.

I was aiming at a refreshing half day at the pool. But on arrival the reception told me that it was closed until saturday! I think it is horrific that when they close the pool for over three days they do not publish this on the internet. The reception tried to help me with finding another pool. But one suggestion (Indigo), did not allow others than the hotel recidents access to the pool. The other suggestion (emperador) charged 35 euro for a whole day and by the time I was there I only had 2 hours left before other appointments. Also the Emperador does not have parasols so it could possibly be a very hot experience in the sunbed. So all this effort I turned out to end up in a Tapas bar.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. I had to sit at the counter as all the tables were booked when I arrived but that was fine as plenty of space and comfortable bar stools.  I chose the Pad Thai which contained soya. So flavoursome and delicious it won’t be long before I go back. A cheese cake for desert nade with membrilla, a quince jelly was just perfect and not too heavy. Washed down with a lovely glass of red it was a perfect meal. 2 courses and wine came to 19€.

First of all - we are vegetarians and have been to many vegetarian restaurants so this isn't a case of judging food that uses mock meats etc.. We loved the atmosphere. It was a cozy place with friendly staff. But unfortunately we were sorely disappointed by the food. It was really strange tasting. We had the burger and the tacos, and both just tasted so weird in a very negative sense. It just wasn't a flavor either of us enjoyed. I can't imagine anyone enjoying the taste but the many positive reviews this place got prove us wrong, I guess. If you like veggie burgers that taste like burgers and tacos that taste like tacos, then this isn't the place for you.

Thats how good it is. Moy Ben was our waiters name , in namesake only, as he certainly didnt wait to take our order. Haha. Ha. Im not Vegan. I love a meaty sausolito in my mouth just as much as the next bloke , I actually came in here (I cant repeat that often enough) looking for a toilet , but always would confuse 'banós' with 'garbanzos' so Moy just answered 'cervesa?' which I fought meant some extra service with my toilet experience. So there I was , in my soiled pantaloons smashin a coldie with some tasty chickpeas and fought I mices well order a main, on the principal. There were lots of attractive fashionable rich non vegans there , as is the case with most of Madrid , except for the 'rich' thing. So I stared at them alot and undressed most of them with my dark matador eyes whilst reeking of excrement , which gave me plenty of personal space in an otherwise crowded restaurant. Space I appreciate. Of course I would never say the word 'matador' in such an establishment , infact I was nervous pulling out my leather wallet , so I convincingly told Moy that I had just stolen it from the stereotype 'Brevic' up at Cats who had acid and now at the age of 26 can answer all and any of the universes great mysteries , like whether to push or pull the iron gate besides his permanent smoking spot...venturing any further could mean getting mugged by immigrants...which is what actually happened to him.....in my mind.....as I was (convincingly) explaining to Moy Ben. This restaurant squirts all over the place. Its a fountain of truth (if you are wealthy) and not only that , but our waiter spent seven years on the Goldie so he was true-blue as Dave Sharma.

This is definitely a place to return to, maybe for the lunchtime menu again, or maybe an evening meal from the interesting and varied a la carte. The restaurant was extremely busy, which is always a good sign that you're going to have a great meal. All those people can't be wrong.

The back story for talented young chef, Maria Marte, is enough to convince any disbeliever. She arrived in Madrid from the Dominican Republic with no experience and started working as a dishwasher. Twelve years later she's the chef at a good but not great Madrid restaurant which had previously held single star for some years. Under her guidance the restaurant now has a second star, and, judging from our experience there, is headed for the greatest accolade, a third star. Everything is exquisite, from the first taste of the amuse bouche to the dessert. And to our surprise, we could see the point of the disassembly of the dishes to make something new. The wines, for the most part from the best Riojas, were excellent. If you can get a seat, go there.

I got lucky and did find an available reservation for the same day .  Restaurant is located in some gorgeous looking old building and there are no signs with name outside .  It was the first time for me to dine alone in a restaurant and I must say I was a bit nervous and shy.  As I walked in , I was greeted with smiles and was shown to my table , which was in the corner and I could observe the entire restaurant during dining .... I was the only solo guest there that night ....  My waiter's name was Miguel (if I'm not mistaken ) and was he awesome?! He even had a little conversation with me during dining , which I did find sweet of him.  I went for a 12 course choice dinner. Everything was so delicious and definitely worth every penny in my opinion.  By the end of the dinner the chef came to every table and asked how was the dinner and after thanked for coming in.

I became interested in the restaurant after reading articles in El Pais and elsewhere about the restaurant and its head chef, Maria Marte. We chose the ten-course tasting menu; a vegetarian version was prepared for me which I had requested when making the reservation. We enjoyed a succession of exquisite dishes prepared with a deep culinary understanding and commitment. Of course we had slight favorites and an occasional preparation may have been a bit saltier than what I would consider ideal but quality was always at the highest level and each provided a highly enjoyable moment, like unwrapping a series of gifts carefully chosen by someone who knows one very well. The vegetarian version was admirably well-done too, an unusual experience indeed. Every detail was thought-out and presented very well, from the extraordinary bread selection, all baked in house, to the Castillo de Canena olive oil, one of the most celebrated in Espana, which our waiter kept flowing for the fabulous bread.  The effort involved in such a production was obviously immense and the results were extraordinary. The staff, waiters, and sommelier were quite busy but nonetheless always sought to please in a manner of sincerity and utmost hospitality. The final tab reflected an expensive evening, as expected, but we were so pleased that we deemed the experience a great value. We could not have chosen a better establishment in which to celebrate our anniversary: our conclusion was that El Club Allard proved the best restaurant experience of our 30 years together. We look forward to returning with other family members in 2016.",2015-11-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or130-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26566,0.0,0.771,0.229,0.9975,0.2525,0.6138888888888889,0.4124272727272727,1760,133,0.0755681818181818,0,30,False,42,0.1521739130434782,0.0869565217391304,0.4782608695652174,0.0652173913043478,0.1304347826086956,0.0,0.0217391304347826,0.0217391304347826,0.0217391304347826,0.0217391304347826,289,190,5.0899653979238755,0,0,month recent trip madrid book reserv wife el club allard celebr th wed anniversari becam interest restaur read articl el pai elsewher restaur head chef maria mart chose ten cours tast menu vegetarian version prepar request make reserv enjoy success exquisit dish prepar deep culinari understand commit cours slight favorit occasion prepar may bit saltier would consid ideal qualiti alway highest level provid highli enjoy moment like unwrap seri gift care chosen someon know one well vegetarian version admir well done unusu experi inde everi detail thought present well extraordinari bread select bake hous castillo de canena oliv oil one celebr espana waiter kept flow fabul bread effort involv product obvious immens result extraordinari staff waiter sommeli quit busi nonetheless alway sought pleas manner sincer utmost hospit final tab reflect expens even expect pleas deem experi great valu could chosen better establish celebr anniversari conclus el club allard prove best restaur experi year togeth look forward return famili member,good review,4

In other words, four dishes for the two of us was more than enough. Our choices: shrimp in garlic sauce, potatoes bravas, fried eggplant, and chorizos -- but there were lots of other tempting things there as well. There are a lot of great choices on the menu, and a goodly number of specials on the blackboards too. This is a small place that oozes authenticity. The seats are glorified stools, and there aren't too many of them. (There appears to be more space upstairs, but we didn't check it out.)  We got there for lunch at about 1:30 on a Saturday, and just beat the rush. Within 20 minutes the place was packed. Most of the people were drinking beer or wine.

In the spring and summer you'll find a pool here but in the colder months they cover the pool and it becomes a lounge.  The drinks are strong and the service is impeccable. The views of the city from this vantage point are also excellent.  You don't have to be a guest f the hotel to be admitted up. However, staying at the hotel could help you bypass the lines that form outside the hotel to make it up here.  The bar is trendy and hip. The music playing is just right to create an ambience of chill. And the bartenders and servers are all beautiful men.  Come on up and have a drink or two. And stick around for the views.

We opted for lunch and chose the smaller course lunch (12 courses I think?). It's hard to describe just how interesting and amazing the courses were. In fact, just writing ""interesting"" would normally make me question it! I had forgotten (after reading reviews) that eating the business card was part of our first course. It was served with an onion foam. I'm, truthfully, not big on ""foams"", BUT it was ridiculously good and was eaten by tearing up our ""business card"" and dipping it into the foam. It was all my husband and I could do by not dipping our fingers into the bowl and wiping it clean. Each course was wonderful. My favorite was the truffle ""cupcake"". The decor is traditional old world. Chandeliers, big mirrors, rather formal. The staff seemed a little stiff and formal at first until they realized that we were there to have have fun and enjoy the experience. We had a good time talking with them. We ended with a view upstairs of the kitchen and the chef came out to greet us and thank us, which I thought was lovely considering the place was jam packed full. I also thought it was reasonably priced considering everything.

That...","I have been fortunate enough to dine at a number of one Michelin star restaurants over the years. But before El Club Allard, I had only had an opportunity to dine at one two Michelin star restaurant, the sadly closed Cyrus in Healdsburg, California. That dining experience at Cyrus however was so dramatically different than any other meal I have had, from the ambiance, to the service, to the food. It was a fantastic meal that I will remember forever.  I came into El Club Allard with lofty expectations given my previous experience at a two Michelin star restaurant. Sadly, El Club Allard failed to meet those expectations and even fell short of the experience I have had at a number of one Michelin star restaurants. While I certainly do not feel qualified to critique a restaurant of its pedigree, I cannot recommend dining at El Club Allard.  El Club Allard did have a lot in common with my dinner at Cyrus. The food was executed extremely well. Every component was treated with respect and cooked perfectly. The food was also seasoned aggressively (only a single dish required me to add salt to enhance it). The dishes were plated in an appealing manner and often with a welcome playfulness. The service was attentive. Given the above, it would probably seem as though I have a positive impression of my experience. Unfortunately the meal suffered from a few critical flaws, the most glaring of which was that there was simply not a course I will remember. The two courses that were legitimately excellent (a wild duck course and an Iberico pork course) were excellent but were outshined by preparations I have had at other restaurants (though the use of banana in the pork course was unique and enjoyable). When spending a significant amount on a tasting (and granted the restaurant is exceedingly reasonably priced for a two Michelin star restaurant), I expect dishes of the meal to be memorable. This was not the case and a cardinal sin for me. Another major failure for me was that a number of the dishes simply were not enjoyable. I find this less objectionable than a meal lacking memorable highs but still highly disappointing. At times my lack of enjoyment was because I was not a fan of the flavors. This I can fully accept (palates differ and restaurants of this caliber are supposed to push boundaries). At other times, it was because dishes seemed more focused on technique than on bringing joy to the diner. This menu was at its best when it took a superior ingredient (e.g. wild duck and Iberico pork) and simply prepared it so that the ingredient shined. This was too infrequently the case. Where the focus of a dish was on culinary technique and impact of presentation, it suffered for it at El Club Allard. This was not the case at Cyrus where the spectacle complemented food that stood on its own merit.  The last major shortcoming from me was in the service. While attentive, the service did not exude any warmth. That would have been tolerable except that the service also de-emphasized educating the diner. When I eat in a restaurant of this caliber where the techniques and ingredients used are often novel, I expect to be educated about this. This was not the case for me (perhaps my experience would have been different if I had been fluent in Spanish). This aspect proved to be a letdown. Again, I cannot presume to think I am qualified to critique a restaurant of this caliber. So this is just one man’s opinion. But I entered the meal intently focused on enjoying and savoring the experience. I left feeling very disappointed and wishing I had a memory to take away from the dinner other than now knowing every two star Michelin restaurant is not a sure thing. Maybe I was there on an off-night. Maybe the same meal spoke to others in a way it did not speak to me. But even with the exceedingly reasonable price tag, I cannot recommend dining at El Club Allard based on my experience.",2016-03-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or120-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26603,0.083,0.779,0.138,0.9928,0.128056943056943,0.5571767121767123,0.5083575,3918,354,0.0903522205206738,0,75,False,106,0.0773809523809523,0.1071428571428571,0.2976190476190476,0.0476190476190476,0.1785714285714285,0.0238095238095238,0.0238095238095238,0.0416666666666666,0.1369047619047619,0.0654761904761904,691,316,4.667149059334298,0,0,fortun enough dine number one michelin star restaur year el club allard opportun dine one two michelin star restaur sadli close cyru healdsburg california dine experi cyru howev dramat differ meal ambianc servic food fantast meal rememb forev came el club allard lofti expect given previou experi two michelin star restaur sadli el club allard fail meet expect even fell short experi number one michelin star restaur certainli feel qualifi critiqu restaur pedigre cannot recommend dine el club allard el club allard lot common dinner cyru food execut extrem well everi compon treat respect cook perfectli food also season aggress singl dish requir add salt enhanc dish plate appeal manner often welcom play servic attent given would probabl seem though posit impress experi unfortun meal suffer critic flaw glare simpli cours rememb two cours legitim excel wild duck cours iberico pork cours excel outshin prepar restaur though use banana pork cours uniqu enjoy spend signific amount tast grant restaur exceedingli reason price two michelin star restaur expect dish meal memor case cardin sin anoth major failur number dish simpli enjoy find less objection meal lack memor high still highli disappoint time lack enjoy fan flavor fulli accept palat differ restaur calib suppos push boundari time dish seem focus techniqu bring joy diner menu best took superior ingredi e g wild duck iberico pork simpli prepar ingredi shine infrequ case focu dish culinari techniqu impact present suffer el club allard case cyru spectacl complement food stood merit last major shortcom servic attent servic exud warmth would toler except servic also de emphas educ diner eat restaur calib techniqu ingredi use often novel expect educ case perhap experi would differ fluent spanish aspect prove letdown cannot presum think qualifi critiqu restaur calib one man opinion enter meal intent focus enjoy savor experi left feel disappoint wish memori take away dinner know everi two star michelin restaur sure thing mayb night mayb meal spoke other way speak even exceedingli reason price tag cannot recommend dine el club allard base experi,very bad review,1

The restaurant is located in one of the most gorgeous palaces in the centre of Madrid, in the corner of Ferraz with Plaza de España. I've taken innumerable pictures of that building without knowing I'd eventually see its insides. Inside, it feels like it should: an old house transformed into a modern restaurant, with elegantly spartan decoration. Since my Mother started the meal as a skeptic, I conceded going for the shortest of the three menus offered (much to my suffering) since that was her pre-condition. Portions were very appropriate for the length of the menu, and by the end of the dinner we were satisfied but not too full. Just perfect. Another good point about it is the relatively fair price for their fare, which is something that can be discussed about other Michelin starred restaurants. The meal started with a little silly surprise (do not read this paragraph if you don't want the spoiler!): we were brought a foamy bowl and instructed to eat it with the business card placed in front of us, which turned out to be made of some sort of potato paper. It was nicer than expected, but they need to improve on the texture of the card, which was too paper-y. Otherwise it was a fun thing to do, and we all laughed. Great way to break the ice when one of the diners isn't yet into the idea. Overall, the food was delicious in flavour, and generally well balanced, though we all agreed that two of the dishes needed work on the texture (the surprise one mentioned above, and another one presented as a muffin, which has a liquid centre: the muffin had crunchy parts that were way too hard). Dish presentation was fun, the ingredients used of great quality, and staff was very nice all through the dinner. Definitely recommendable for quiet friend reunions, small adult families, couples, or even small business meals.",2016-03-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or120-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_19332,0.026,0.775,0.199,0.9978,0.2888377192982457,0.525657894736842,0.4519333333333333,2131,179,0.0839981229469732,1,56,False,59,0.0879120879120879,0.1868131868131868,0.3076923076923077,0.0659340659340659,0.0989010989010989,0.0219780219780219,0.0329670329670329,0.0549450549450549,0.0879120879120879,0.0549450549450549,373,241,4.7158176943699734,0,0,much complain modern food manag trick mother let treat el club allard madrid partner despit origin animos end enjoy point restaur alreadi accomplish primari mission restaur locat one gorgeou palac centr madrid corner ferraz plaza de espa taken innumer pictur build without know eventu see insid insid feel like old hous transform modern restaur elegantli spartan decor sinc mother start meal skeptic conced go shortest three menu offer much suffer sinc pre condit portion appropri length menu end dinner satisfi full perfect anoth good point rel fair price fare someth discuss michelin star restaur meal start littl silli surpris read paragraph want spoiler brought foami bowl instruct eat busi card place front us turn made sort potato paper nicer expect need improv textur card paper otherwis fun thing laugh great way break ice one diner yet idea overal food delici flavour gener well balanc though agre two dish need work textur surpris one mention anoth one present muffin liquid centr muffin crunchi part way hard dish present fun ingredi use great qualiti staff nice dinner definit recommend quiet friend reunion small adult famili coupl even small busi meal,very good review,5

I won't describe the food - I believe the surprise element is part of the fun - the very first item you nibble is INCREDIBLY surprising. It's just all delicate and creative and visually delightful.

Warm service from Juan, David, Allen, Josefina and boss Carmelo. And exemplary food: raciones at reasonable prices. Highlights include: chorizo, berenjena con miel (aubergine with honey), chopitos (deep fried baby squid), pinch moruno (skewered grilled pork in moroccoan spices) and their mushrooms. For bolder tastes, and being a classic Madrid tavern, their offal is great: the mollejas (sweetbreads) fried in garlic and parsley are lush as are their zarajos.

Some dishes from the tasting menu were visually stunning, some were visually dire. Some were of mediocre taste/texture, others were utterly sublime. The Maitre d', blatantly looked after those who, it looked like 'had a few quid', and gave us minimal time in comparison. It is not a 'cosy' restaurant, and things like the restrooms were very clinical, minimalistic, and cold. Don't get me wrong, I don't like 'old world pomp' of gold and drapes and all that nonsense, but this place just felt soulless. The head chef came out to all the tables, ours included, and it was all a bit embarrassing really, as if you have not had a mind blowing experience, then, what do you say??!!!

So for my Mother's 70th birthday I made a point to get a table for all the family at Club Allard and have a tasting Menu prepared by Chef Maria Marte. I have eaten at several Michelin Star restaurants before but this was special. The fusion of Caribbean products with Old world ingredients make it special and very different. Each plate was unique and intriguing.  I can describe each plate of the tasting menu but it is impossible to explain the explosion of tastes in once mouth at each table spoon of food.  I suggest to any food lover that is passing by in Madrid to get a reservation before hand as there are only 9 tables and if you are really lucky for groups of 6 there is a special private room with a glass wall overlooking the kitchen which is a treat in itself seeing someone as passionate and professional as Maria Marte in her surroundings.

The place is first of all situated in a gorgeous building with no signs anywhere. There is simply an open door and candle light to the restaurant. The atmosphere is beyond words. Everything is so beautiful and perfect with a combination of old stylish buiding and modern decor. So to the food which is indescribable in its beauty and taste. The menu and everything is served with such creativity. The taste of each dish is lasting on your tongue for so long.

We tried this place for dinner last night and thoroughly enjoyed our evening there, We arrived at about 8:45. and beat the crowds. We were promptly seated and provided with menus. The time to take our order was a bit long, but that was due to the crowds starting to arrive. We were a party of 4, and we ordered the grilled octopus, ham croquettes, shrimp risotto, grilled beef tenderloin, and potatoes in a paparika sauce, and a pitcher of sangria, The food arrived quickly, and was absolutely delicious. The sangria had bits of sliced fruit and was served on ice and made a perfect accompaniment to the tapas. The portions were large, and we could not finish all the food, A piece of advice, potatoes are used quite a bit on the other dishes such as potato chips with the croquettes, and beef, as well as sliced potatoes with the grilled octopus, Had we known we would probably not have ordered a separate potato dish. To conclude the meal we were all given complimentary shots of a liquor similar to Bailey’s.

However it did not matter as the restaurant did not disappoint. The staff were friendly and many extra were provided as described by other reviews. My partner had a steak with a sauce which he said was very good and I had the salmon pasta dish which was very creamy and delicious. The wine list was as expected from a restaurant of this calibre. Do not be put off by the road - Calle Hortaleza is a road off the Gran Via and as we walked up it it seemed to get more and more run down but we felt safe. Once inside the restaurant the ambience was great. Do try a De Maria restaurant - they specialise in Argentinian beef.

This was our ‘blow out’ meal in Madrid and we had high expectations. It wasn’t easy to find – we were running late and arrived somewhat breathless. Fortunately we had read that it was on a corner, behind an iron door and up some stairs. The restaurant is a group of small rooms, somewhat formal looking. The chef, Diego Guerrero, comes out and meets with every guest and basically takes your order. He’s very personable and we were thrilled to meet him. They offer 3 tasting menus and we chose the “Seduction” menu. It was 12 small courses, each one amazing (3 snacks, 3 starters, 1 fish, 1 meat, 1 dessert appetizers, 2 desserts, coffee and petit fours). The server explained each course and how to eat it. We didn't order a bottle of wine (my husband doesn't drink), but I had a few glasses of wine (different whites) and then a cava. We finished with coffee. It was an incredible experience and well worth the approximately 228 euros bill. Service was excellent and the meal was well paced. At the end of the evening, Diego came by our table again to see how we had fared.

Sadly we did not meet the chef, as others did, but the service was impeccable, the servers friendly and as helpful as they could possibly be with our limited Spanish, and we had a highly enjoyable three hours over our meal. If I have one criticism it is that the humour and wit of a couple of courses overtook the balance of the food - the concept was inventive, but the execution didn't quite live up to it. (Spoiler alert if you've not been) By this I mean that the final, totally convincing egg, was of too sweet a chocolate - reminded me of Kinder egg chocolate - and that this, in combination with the chocolatey, coconutty sawdust, overbalanced the necessary tartness of the fruit yolk.

The restaurant is used to travelers stopping by- and offered me a menu in Spanish and English. A small touch which is not only considerate but rather rare. I had the lunch special of the day which was two courses plus espresso. For only 9,90 euros!! Oswaldo was my server and he walked me through the menu with a smile. After the meal was over he offered me a delicious cream liquor shot— on the house! I so appreciate them engaging and talking with me about life, traveling, and the city of Madrid.

Ultimately, the menu was not exactly the same and there were some things missing from the menu at the ""main"" location. So I don't feel we had the same magic sauce as the other location. The garlic shrimp was Good. Everything else we had was Good, but not extraordinary, except the octopus. It wasn't bad it was just basic and after eating octopus many times in Spain it was just 101. The sangria was also 101. Our server who was the same person who walked us over was just not so happy that night. Maybe he wasn't happy with his “reassignment”.

We have had a very pleasant dinner at El Club Allard. It is located in a superb building. We had dinner in a classy room, nicely decorated. The chef came to our table to inquire about allergies and food we dislike. A very nice attention indeed.  Although the place used to be a very select club, one feels really at ease. The service is attentive, yet not intrusive. Waiters and the sommelier are very nice and were attentive to our needs; and each meal was well explained.  The wine list is very extensive. We know our wine but not so with Spanish ones so we followed the advice of the sommelier whose choice proved very good.  On the minus side: the sommelier and waiters do not seem to know how to pour wine. Each time drops of wine fell on the table. At the end of our meal there were many wine stains on the tablecloth. Not very classy... Ok, now the food. It is somehow inventive, and there is quite some attention to the way it is presented, with a few surprises (that I shall not reveal in this review. I think the less one reads about it the better, the element of discovery is part of the experience) My main (and major) complain is the food. What we got certainly was superbly presented, but taste wise, we were left wondering. Almost all our dishes were quite bland, bordering tastelessness. All other Michelin star restaurants food made my mouth water, with explosion of flavor to my taste buds. I am sorry to say this was not the case here.  Some dishes were interesting such as the Mini Babybell of Camembert trufee. The highlight was the Butter fish Tapa, which was truly excellent. But that was it. We left quite disappointed, wondering whether this was not a triumph of style over substance. There are three menus on offer. What differs between them is that some have more starters and snacks than others. We chose the menu Rendez Vous. (the 'short' one) At 85 euros, it is made of 10 dishes (2 snacks, 2 starters, 1 fish, 1 meat, 1 dessert appetizer, 2 desserts and coffee). Needless to say this is very good value for money. Overall, i was disappointed because I came with the expectations of a 2 Michelin star quality meal. I did not have that.  If you are simply looking for an unusual meal, and not too fussy about food quality, you certainly will want to try El Club Allard, which is well worth trying at this price range. The foodies will certainly be looking someplace else.",2012-10-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or420-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26703,0.048,0.812,0.14,0.9918,0.2073175973686177,0.5945320325932572,0.4608181818181817,2463,220,0.0893219650832318,0,74,False,87,0.0695652173913043,0.1130434782608695,0.2956521739130435,0.0608695652173913,0.1304347826086956,0.0695652173913043,0.0521739130434782,0.0434782608695652,0.1043478260869565,0.0608695652173913,450,266,4.464444444444444,0,0,feel bad give averag rate restaur pleasant dinner el club allard locat superb build dinner classi room nice decor chef came tabl inquir allergi food dislik nice attent inde although place use select club one feel realli eas servic attent yet intrus waiter sommeli nice attent need meal well explain wine list extens know wine spanish one follow advic sommeli whose choic prove good minu side sommeli waiter seem know pour wine time drop wine fell tabl end meal mani wine stain tablecloth classi ok food somehow invent quit attent way present surpris shall reveal review think less one read better element discoveri part experi main major complain food got certainli superbl present tast wise left wonder almost dish quit bland border tasteless michelin star restaur food made mouth water explos flavor tast bud sorri say case dish interest mini babybel camembert trufe highlight butter fish tapa truli excel left quit disappoint wonder whether triumph style substanc three menu offer differ starter snack other chose menu rendez vou short one euro made dish snack starter fish meat dessert appet dessert coffe needless say good valu money overal disappoint came expect michelin star qualiti meal simpli look unusu meal fussi food qualiti certainli want tri el club allard well worth tri price rang foodi certainli look someplac els,average review,3

The last trip was to Madrid and we had many great meals ranging from michelin starred restaurants to tabernas and tapas. We ate at both La Terraza del Casino and El Club Allard (but were unable to book Diverxo), We had lunch at El Club Allard and were pleasantly surprised when the Chef, Diego Guerrero, greeted us at the table. We chose the Seduction menu and left ourselves in his hands. I won't go into detail about each dish, but everything was prepared flawlessly. The portions are not large but after 11 courses were entirely satisfied. The pace is leisurely , the service impeccable. The wine list is extensive focusing on Spanish wines, but the rest of the world is well represented. we started off with a Cava and went onto a Ribera del Duero (Aalto) which was phenomenal. My favorite dishes were the butter fish tapa (I was hoping that one of the guest didn't eat fish), the game truffle with Foie and mushrooms (speechless), the salmon with saffron and sea urchin and the taco hare.

From the moment you sit down, and realise you can eat the restaurant business card on the table you know you're in for something a little unusual. Everything course of the taster menu has some exciting twist - smoke wafted with one dish to enhance the smell; food served over a lantern; a pudding disguised as an egg. Though most importantly the food tastes as well as looking amazing, the theatrical touches add to the experience of the food rather than detract from it.  Everything is spot on the food, the service and the ambience. Whilst not cheap - for food of this quality its good value (the wine list is particularly good value for a restaurant of this quality).",2012-12-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or410-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26718,0.014,0.809,0.177,0.9731,0.2683531746031746,0.6277777777777779,0.61438,748,55,0.0735294117647058,0,17,False,37,0.0697674418604651,0.2093023255813953,0.3023255813953488,0.0697674418604651,0.2093023255813953,0.0465116279069767,0.0232558139534883,0.0,0.0697674418604651,0.0,131,89,4.709923664122138,0,0,fantast restaur invent food present real theatric flair moment sit realis eat restaur busi card tabl know someth littl unusu everyth cours taster menu excit twist smoke waft one dish enhanc smell food serv lantern pud disguis egg though importantli food tast well look amaz theatric touch add experi food rather detract everyth spot food servic ambienc whilst cheap food qualiti good valu wine list particularli good valu restaur qualiti,good review,4

We go often to Michelin star restaurants, and given that this one holds two stars we will compare it to other 2 star restaurants we have been to. With that in mind I would say that this restaurants ranks as a very nice one star...but probably doesn't deserve the second. Let me elaborate... The place  The restaurant is located on a second floor of an elegant building. Having said that it isn't easy to find as there were no obvious indications of the restaurant outside. The place itself was nice, sober and elegant so nothing to say there. The food One comes to a place like this for the food. Audi have to say one is not disappointed (completely at least). The dishes are innovative and some were very good. I have to say though, that although many dishes were good...none was truly exceptional. The fishbowl dessert was very nice, as was perhaps the fish...but somehow they felt just ok...so we found ourselves waiting for the dish that would completely surprise us...unfortunately it never came. Again, the food was not bad...quite the contrary, but often in a two star there is a moment of ""amazement""... The service The service was discrete and adequate...having said that, for a two star, the service from the sommelier (assuming there was one as it wasn't really clear that he was actually qualified for the role) left some room for improvement. He brought us a bottle from the wrong year...and when we confronted him with the fact he apologized and said he didn't have any more bottles from the year in the menu...in a 2 star you expect that explanation before the bottle is brought to the table...not feeling that they were trying to ""see if it would pass""... Overall Very pleasant experience with no ""spikes""...the food was good, the place was pleasant...but somehow it didn't feel like a 2 star...of course it cost half what a French 2 star would cost...but don't know if ""value"" should be the driver of more stars...",2013-03-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or400-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_24193,0.053,0.83,0.117,0.9673,0.2814583333333333,0.5386979166666667,0.46586,1987,177,0.0890790135883241,0,93,False,82,0.1333333333333333,0.1916666666666666,0.25,0.0666666666666666,0.2083333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.025,0.025,0.0416666666666666,0.025,349,195,4.693409742120344,0,0,hotel earli march friend go often michelin star restaur given one hold two star compar star restaur mind would say restaur rank nice one star probabl deserv second let elabor place restaur locat second floor eleg build said easi find obviou indic restaur outsid place nice sober eleg noth say food one come place like food audi say one disappoint complet least dish innov good say though although mani dish good none truli except fishbowl dessert nice perhap fish somehow felt ok found wait dish would complet surpris us unfortun never came food bad quit contrari often two star moment amaz servic servic discret adequ said two star servic sommeli assum one realli clear actual qualifi role left room improv brought us bottl wrong year confront fact apolog said bottl year menu star expect explan bottl brought tabl feel tri see would pass overal pleasant experi spike food good place pleasant somehow feel like star cours cost half french star would cost know valu driver star,average review,3

This restaurant isn't for everyone. Firstly come with an open mind and let the team surprise you with all the taste explosions..secondly if your idea of good meal is a big chunk of meat and mountain of mash then I would skip this one. From outside you might not think this is a restaurant at all.There's no cheesy sign or banner out front only a friendly doorman who tells you that the restaurant is on the first floor on the right ( or second depends on where you are from ). There are several small rooms for individual guests or a big room for a larger group. Then you will be presented with three kinds of menu which you can choose. We were told if we are returning we can also choose what or not to repeat on the menu you choose which is rather quite flexible for this kind of restaurant. We did indulge ourself with the menu ""la revolución silenciosa "" which was the full tasting menu.  I don't want to get into much details here. But from start to finish it was a surprisingly wonderful. It's absolute worth the time and penny.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. The sommelier was particularly nice and we really enjoyed the chef to come to our table at the end of the meal.  Leave some times to enjoy and dress up a little. Just to be on the safe side.

Had earlier in the day explored Plaza Del Angel area, and my wife and I decided to hit a tapas bar on the last night of our entry stay to Madrid before heading out to Toledo. Saw entry for Casa Toni in T.A. and gave it a try. Restaurant front was brightly lit and entry eatery was small with a window side table and low bench seats for 2. There was a long narrow table with stools for maybe 10 , a few bar stools at the counter next to a small bathroom sized kitchen and a table for 2 with taller stools, which we managed to grab adjacent to a stairwell to an upstairs space that seemed to swallow local patrons who were never seen again as well as being the location for the washrooms. The walls were decorated with photos of autographed flamenco dancers, bullfighters, celebrities posing with staff past and present as well as some what seemed to be pre or contemporary Franco era photos of Madrid. The long bench table was packed with Americans on a guided Tapas crawl, the window table with locals out for a while and the bar seats changed constantly with in and out traffic. It was even for Madrid unseasonably hot and the street was buzzing. We started with a few glasses of Sangria and were given our 1st tapas of pork on bread. We ordered a glass of white house and red wine as well as ordering potatoes with aeoli as well as piquante tomato sauce followed by a mushroom platter along with more wine, changing varieties as we went along. Might have forgotten some other dishes as well as wine service but everything was excellent. It was more of an event than a meal. Somewhere amid meal, American Tapas crawl was replaced by an Australian hosted crawl of a rather more subdued crowd of indeterminate nationality. The locals never reappeared from upstairs. The kitchen and waiters never paused to breath but were always attentive. We even got complementary Muscat at the end of our meal. Don't know if it's always like this or it might have been a perfect storm of temperature, patrons and personalities but it was an amazing adventure.

The food was gorgeous. Each plate clearly had a lot of thought and technique put into it, but in the end, you just want a delicious bite of food and that was an all too infrequent find amongst the twelve plates we were served. The descriptions were good, but the service had a strange way of framing the surprising twists and use of ingredients. It felt like the joke was on the guest rather than being in on it. Revealing that something already eaten was something actually something else left us confused and unable to appreciate what had been done.

We waited for 5 minutes at the door as they fumbled around with tables. The courses were served with explanations only in Spanish, my fault I don't speak enough Spanish, and eventually no discussion of the food; coupled with wine and wine spillage. I have eaten in many Michelin starred restaurants and found it interesting that the service in some non starred restaurants is highly above those encountered in Spain. I love Spain but then I guess I don't understand the service nature. The restaurant was ""booked out"" for lunch, however there were many tables empty. Overall a great meal with lots of fun elements; the pizzara (blackboard) for example.The location is easy to find...if you know it is there. There is no signage making it seem a little exclusive.

Our party opted for the Seduction menu and each of the 12 innovative courses' was given individual appraisal as they were consumed.Very mixed comments accompanied each one. Although every course was beautifully and in some cases spectacularly presented, as one of the Trip Advisor reviewers commented it is the food that matters. The concentus of opinion in our group was one of the blandness of the majority of the dishes. The addition of the infused foam on certain dishes only seemed to kill rather enhance the flavour. It is obvious to anyone who visits El Club Allard that a great deal of time effort and ingenuity has gone in to the creation and execution of these dishes, but the nuances & subtle flavour experiences get lost somewhere. The whole appeared to taste less than the sum of the ingredient parts, sadly.  The wine varieties from Ourense in Galicia, Avila & Cigales in Castilla y Leon, Mentrida in Castilla-La Mancha and a Malaga dessert wine, although not your normal wine fayre, just being different and refreshing is no substitute if in our groups opinion, they were all generally a bit on the lightweight side. The service was discreet and informative, the ambiance fine albeit slightly subdued given the number of dinners that evening. I am sorry, but for all our party, who are no shrinking violets when it comes to the enjoyment of gourmet fine dining and who had been anticipating something really special that evening, it turned out to be a case of style over substance. .",2013-02-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or400-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_23405,0.055,0.835,0.11,0.9168,0.1571899115377376,0.6248541313758704,0.46662,1584,129,0.0814393939393939,0,28,False,33,0.1052631578947368,0.1052631578947368,0.2631578947368421,0.0263157894736842,0.131578947368421,0.0263157894736842,0.0,0.0789473684210526,0.131578947368421,0.131578947368421,273,182,4.802197802197802,0,0,decid el club allard result mainli posit review trip advisor parti opt seduct menu innov cours given individu apprais consum mix comment accompani one although everi cours beauti case spectacularli present one trip advisor review comment food matter concentu opinion group one bland major dish addit infus foam certain dish seem kill rather enhanc flavour obviou anyon visit el club allard great deal time effort ingenu gone creation execut dish nuanc subtl flavour experi get lost somewher whole appear tast less sum ingredi part sadli wine varieti ourens galicia avila cigal castilla leon mentrida castilla la mancha malaga dessert wine although normal wine fayr differ refresh substitut group opinion gener bit lightweight side servic discreet inform ambianc fine albeit slightli subdu given number dinner even sorri parti shrink violet come enjoy gourmet fine dine anticip someth realli special even turn case style substanc,average review,3

There is nothing on the exterior of this building to indicate that the restaurant is within this building. Look for the number 2 above the door. The doorman will direct you to the restaurant located on the second floor. This is a very formal restaurant. I went for lunch and the some patrons were casually dressed. Most of the male patrons wore a coat and tie.  Diego Guerrero of el Club Allard is one of the few chefs on the planet that can combine seemingly random ingredients in a coherent way. His menu is a feast for nearly all the senses. Each dish is a work of art. Some delicate. Some whimsical. Some are just over the top. All are a feast for the eyes. The subtle and yet sometimes startling combinations of taste and textures was thrilling in one dish but left me confused in another. Such is the risk of cutting edge cuisine. Diego Guerrero is a maestro of the culinary arts. Eating here is a memorable event.   Fourteen courses, six different wines and a digestif. Lunch from 13h30 to 16H15.

I believe it is sort of a social club and that this is their restaurant, but frankly am not sure. What I do know is that if I were to give anyone the address and say this pace is a restaraunt people would not think so when they arrive to the location. The great thing was that you can get tables in small rooms and close the doors and therefore be in a very private environment.  The service is exceptional. The waiters are focused on the client being extremely satisfied. We had a 10 course degustation meal which was quite exquisite. The waiters would come and explain each coure: how it was prepared and how to eat it. It was really extremely delicious. We had (in spanish): - chupito de pez - ravioli de guisante - cupckae de trufa - Usuzuruki en flor - Arroz del Mar - Sancocho de rape - Asado negro - Flor de hibiscus con pisco sour - Rocas de chocolate - La Pizarra I highñy recommend the restaurant.

We arrived having not made a reservation but where welcomed and allowed to choose where we wanted to sit. The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed, most diners were Spanish but we could have been at home. The staff didn't speak much English but we didn't speak much Spanish or Italian either, so ordering took a little longer than normal but it wasn't a problem for them or us. I ordered the mussels and my friend the caprese salad and the portions were enormous. Neither of us finished because we wanted to sample the mains (lasagne and porcini mushroom risotto). These again were both delicious. We had a nice long break after these (about 25 minutes) so we called have dessert. We couldn't come all that way without sampling them lol. I ordered tiramisu and my friend raspberry cheesecake, both of which were light and tasty. We had 2 bottles of wine and water and were amazed when the mere was a great deal at €110. We were then given a small decanter of limoncello to wash it all down X. The restaurant was clean and elegantly decorated. The staff were welcoming, attentive and very polite.

Although we had had our fair share of local food we still wanted to eat at a high rated, local restaurant. After seeing reviews on TripAdvisor, I decided on De Maria. My sister and I will tell you, it did not disappoint. It was so wonderful to have an amazing ribeye and salad after eating nothing but tapas for days! Do not mistake it for a typical Steakhouse either. We sat at the bar and watched the steaks being cooked on the grill while we were treated like royalty by our waiter, Tito! Complimentary appetizers as well as dessert were just a small part of this wonderful treatment! I read that this is not out of the ordinary. It reminded me of a Fleming's Steakhouse (because of the service), but the food selection was unique. I would definitely go there again and again!!!  Note: We ordered take away for our mother and tired little sister and they had no problem preparing it at just the right time so that their food was right off the grill and had not been waiting under a heat lamp!

The restaurant is small and unassuming with a ton of Spanish charm. We took a small table by the entrance and were immediately approached by a server with a massive smile. Our drinks were served promptly with a complimentary tapas of bread and ham drizzled in olive oil and garnished with a sprinkle of paprika. Not large, but enough to tide you over until your order arrives. Although super full from lunch, my mission that day was to try the Orejas and we ordered the lambs kidneys as well. The Orejas ala plancha (pigs ears) came piping hot, perfectly seasoned morsels of soft, crunchy, grilled delight! Pigs ears are quite soft and fatty so you do need to be mentally prepared for the texture if you've never had them before, and they're served with a side sauce that tasted of roast capsicum, tomato and garlic (I didn't ask) which was a fresh zingy counter foil to the juicy Orejas. The Riñones a la plancha were equally tasty slices of lamb kidneys cooked perfectly on a hot grill and served with a wedge of lemon to squeeze over. Firm yet tender, the kidneys did not have an overwhelming taste of sheep (or offal), well cleaned and prepared. Portion size is perfect for two (hungry) people, however we were full from lunch and could not finish the dish. When we were done, we were served a complimentary digestif which was lovely and very much appreciated. I will be back one day to try the callos caseros (homemade tripe stew) which I've tried elsewhere and love. If you like offal, want to go local, and unpretentious.. this is a definite recommendation",2017-09-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1907082-Reviews-or100-Casa_Toni-Madrid.html,UID_26821,0.004,0.774,0.222,0.9975,0.1676820728291316,0.4616246498599439,0.2433153846153845,1680,128,0.0761904761904762,1,44,False,57,0.1212121212121212,0.1363636363636363,0.3333333333333333,0.0303030303030303,0.1363636363636363,0.0454545454545454,0.0454545454545454,0.0,0.106060606060606,0.0454545454545454,296,203,4.679054054054054,0,0,enjoy eat unwant bit experienc authent local fare casa toni definit disappoint restaur small unassum ton spanish charm took small tabl entranc immedi approach server massiv smile drink serv promptli complimentari tapa bread ham drizzl oliv oil garnish sprinkl paprika larg enough tide order arriv although super full lunch mission day tri oreja order lamb kidney well oreja ala plancha pig ear came pipe hot perfectli season morsel soft crunchi grill delight pig ear quit soft fatti need mental prepar textur never serv side sauc tast roast capsicum tomato garlic ask fresh zingi counter foil juici oreja ri one la plancha equal tasti slice lamb kidney cook perfectli hot grill serv wedg lemon squeez firm yet tender kidney overwhelm tast sheep offal well clean prepar portion size perfect two hungri peopl howev full lunch could finish dish done serv complimentari digestif love much appreci back one day tri callo casero homemad tripe stew tri elsewher love like offal want go local unpretenti definit recommend,very good review,5

As we sat at our table, we were attended by Ms. Violetta who made sure that our evening was fully enjoyable from beginning to end. The Gazpacho that was provided on the house was perfectly seasoned and flavoured. We had the grilled creole chorizo as appetizer and they were delicious.  For main courses, we had the sirloin parrillas along with the grilled asparagus and grilled artichoke hearts, both of which complemented the meat beautifully.

Away from most tourist popular routs, but restaurant very popular with tourist and locals alike. Quite unassuming place from the outside. I could never tell it could be one of the most popular places to have a good meal in town. But deceivingly this is only one more sign of good things to expect.  First good sing – no table available for immediate seating. It took some shuffling with the serving staff to move few customers around to accommodate me with a seat at the bar. For the bar seat perspective, the place still looked more like a place to drop by for a drink, rather than for something to eat. Menus are prepared in few languages – a sing of popularity with people from all over.. I really was looking for a place with traditional Spanish cuisine, as I wanted to try a good traditional Paella, as God intended it for people to enjoy. It wasn’t on a menu, but it was my lucky day, as their had Paella on special that day. My choice was Slamorejo –tomato soup and of course I ordered a Paella as well. It took me a while before I was served my food, but after I had a first taste of Slamorejo, I was so shocked, I did not know how to react. I did not expect that at all… Emotional response to the food it was something first for me… Most probably the best tomato soup I have ever had in my life. Served cold, splashed with a bit of olive oil and topped with chopped ham and hardboiled egg.. Some wonderfully zesty taste (probably of lime) was elevating the sensational composition of flavors. I could not stop smiling to myself while eating. Bravo! I could have that soup for breakfast, lunch, dinner and in between snack… Paella on the other hand did not measure up to the sensational firs course. It was good. In fact - it was very good, but not the best I ever had. Presentation maybe wasn’t too appealing, but with this kind of dish, which meant to be peasant and not too fancy – the secret is in how it tastes not in how it looks. It was a good balance of flavors with some wonderful seafood enhancements. A good dish to have for a daily special. I did enjoy it. In overall – I’m so pleased I listen to all of you good people leaving your reviews.  I had a very good meal and I was happy to take a detour form the usual tourist trails to have it.  Moderately priced. Soup was 4.40 Euro, Paella was priced at 9,50 Euros. And that’s how it was. No hidden fees, no added service – hones food and hones pricing. Super friendly and quite handsome waiting staff just added to my positive experience. I will most definitely come back, as I will never be able to replicate that sensational soup recipe.",2016-06-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2060-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_26832,0.036,0.737,0.227,0.9991,0.3724342324342324,0.5635637695637696,0.4704258064516128,2705,253,0.0935304990757855,1,60,False,113,0.1456953642384106,0.2052980132450331,0.3245033112582781,0.0993377483443708,0.1854304635761589,0.0066225165562913,0.0,0.0066225165562913,0.0132450331125827,0.0132450331125827,510,269,4.3,0,0,tripadvisor review would probabl ever even walk place away tourist popular rout restaur popular tourist local alik quit unassum place outsid could never tell could one popular place good meal town deceivingli one sign good thing expect first good sing tabl avail immedi seat took shuffl serv staff move custom around accommod seat bar bar seat perspect place still look like place drop drink rather someth eat menu prepar languag sing popular peopl realli look place tradit spanish cuisin want tri good tradit paella god intend peopl enjoy menu lucki day paella special day choic slamorejo tomato soup cours order paella well took serv food first tast slamorejo shock know react expect emot respons food someth first probabl best tomato soup ever life serv cold splash bit oliv oil top chop ham hardboil egg wonder zesti tast probabl lime elev sensat composit flavor could stop smile eat bravo could soup breakfast lunch dinner snack paella hand measur sensat fir cours good fact good best ever present mayb appeal kind dish meant peasant fanci secret tast look good balanc flavor wonder seafood enhanc good dish daili special enjoy overal pleas listen good peopl leav review good meal happi take detour form usual tourist trail moder price soup euro paella price euro hidden fee ad servic hone food hone price super friendli quit handsom wait staff ad posit experi definit come back never abl replic sensat soup recip,good review,4

Menu outside looked good so I went in. As they had not started serving I sat at the bar and had a drink. The staff were very friendly and I was taken to my table a few minutes later. I ordered the ribs and french fries. I was given a hot soup canapé, which was very good, together with little pieces of toast and cream cheese. I saw from the bill I was not charged for this. I had ordered my ribs medium rare and that was exactly how they were served. They were excellent. I didn't need ant dessert but I was given a mango based cream sweet and mango yoghurt. Again they were very good and what was even better was that they were free. The staff were very friendly although some of them spoke little English it was better than my Spanish.  De Maria is a little gem to which I will return.

The prices could range from couple of euros to two times the price with slight difference on offered items. This was evident on both De Maria restaurants I visited. Anyway. I had ribeye. Steak was served, as per custom with minimal garnishing, but it was large. Half a kilo large. The sides were horrendously expensive and I just had the hot potato as a side dish. I ordered medium rare. Got ultra rare, but it was fine still. The language barrier is hard to handle when they do not understand ""salt and pepper"" and instead make you pepper sauce, but it's part of the experience.

Reviews had mentioned how busy the place is and this trip was no exception, however we were told that if we wanted to put our names down and have a drink at the bar it wouldn't be long before a table would become available. Sure enough, we were seated in about 10-15 mins. We decided on 5 plates which was plenty between 3 of us. Although the service wasn't always the most attentive (it was quite busy to be fair), all the staff were incredibly friendly and even threw in a cheeky shot as we were leaving.

But not at El Club Allard! Everything from the service to the cushy chairs and well-appointed rooms were focused on comfort. Our waiter was a cheeky and sweet guy who, even though he insisted his English was not good, communicated quite well and even dropped a Nemo reference, which meant he loved Disney movies. As other reviewers have pointed out, the meal begins with an edible card. Pretend to look surprised when they tell you to eat it--it makes them happy to think we haven't researched this place to death and can no longer appreciate surprises. But don't pretend you like it--it tasted pretty bad, especially in the peanut foam it comes with. Thankfully, this is merely for fun and not an indication of the overall meal. The courses were a mix of visually entertaining (the foie gras and truffle ""terranium"", the ""under the sea"" dessert with chocolate seaweed and a marshmallow fish otherwise known as Nemo, the egg dessert which look and felt exactly like an egg until you ate it and discovered that it was coconut panna cotta with mango filling), and the straightforwardly delicious (a simple piece of fluke atop a frozen perilla leaf with basil, a woodsy and earthy root vegetable soup simply simmered, a barely poached egg wrapped in toasted wrap atop a bernaise sauce). The meal ended with cookies surrounded by melting dry ice. It wasn't the ""you can put me down now that I've eaten this spectacular culinary feat"" type of meal, but it was an entertaining, delightful experience that made for wonderful foodie pics (yeah, I'm paying like $200 here, I'm taking my damn no-flash photo!).",2013-04-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or390-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_19520,0.09,0.715,0.195,0.9931,0.1900326797385621,0.5973972922502333,0.6082272727272727,1936,136,0.0702479338842975,2,63,False,41,0.1414141414141414,0.1818181818181818,0.2222222222222222,0.0909090909090909,0.1313131313131313,0.0303030303030303,0.0303030303030303,0.0404040404040404,0.0808080808080808,0.0505050505050505,332,241,4.8343373493975905,0,0,fine dine place food atmospher bare look anywher els food floor concret feet need concentr food music case hear someth pleasant caus synesthes reaction tast bud dull becom stupid el club allard everyth servic cushi chair well appoint room focus comfort waiter cheeki sweet guy even though insist english good commun quit well even drop nemo refer meant love disney movi review point meal begin edibl card pretend look surpris tell eat make happi think research place death longer appreci surpris pretend like tast pretti bad especi peanut foam come thank mere fun indic overal meal cours mix visual entertain foie gra truffl terranium sea dessert chocol seawe marshmallow fish otherwis known nemo egg dessert look felt exactli like egg ate discov coconut panna cotta mango fill straightforwardli delici simpl piec fluke atop frozen perilla leaf basil woodsi earthi root veget soup simpli simmer bare poach egg wrap toast wrap atop bernais sauc meal end cooki surround melt dri ice put eaten spectacular culinari feat type meal entertain delight experi made wonder foodi pic yeah pay like take damn flash photo,very good review,5

I have to say being from San Francisco and having culinary geniuses around every corner I thought it would be a good meal but didn't have any crazy expectations. The staff here blew us away. They sat us in a semi private room toward the back of the restaurant. In the room was a large round table and a book shelf with the restaurant's Michelin awards.  The staff didn't speak the best english so some of the nuance was lost but they were incredibly friendly and attentive. We decided to do the rendevous menu for five. The first course although not very good was super innovative and fun.  Overall, this was one of the best meals of my life. The only other 2 star resturant I had been to til now was Manresa in Los Gatos and club allard made that experience feel mediocre. The total tab for 5 (with wine pairings for 2) was ~520euro. This seemed like a bargain considering the beautiful execution. They also threw in an extra pre-dessert which was special for mom's birthday. At the end of the meal, my indian mother who has never been to a meal like this couldn't stop talking about the little details. The most amusing part for her was they used the tiniest mushrooms in one of their courses.

I chose it based on the reviews on trip advisor and wasn't disappointed. The whole experience was perfect. Right from when I got in touch to book the staff were a perfect mix of friendliness and professionalism. The food was out of this world but it is not just the taste - this is performance food at its best. We went 'all in' and chose the 14 course Revolution and every course was superb. The butter fish shot and the egg and truffle cupcake were a particular highlight. One tip though is don't eat too much of the delicious bread as the 14 courses really add up! With the help of the sommelier who was very friendly we chose a white wine with the starter courses and a red for the main. Both perfectly complimented the food.  I don't understand some of the comments on trip advisor about the staff not bing friendly or speaking good English. Neither was the case. The staff were all both friendly and very knowledgable and their English was good enough to describe all the dishes perfectly well - much much better than my Spanish! I would thoroughly recommend El Club Allard for a really special food experience.

As others have mentioned the meal starts with you eating the business card with a mayo like dip. It was somewhat tasteless but innovative.  Next came three snacks of which our favourite was the egg and truffle cupcake topped with a spinach foam. The waiters then served us the entrees- the sea rice, onion soup and hibiscus flower (eponymous dish). The sea rice was really awesome and innovative (we wont ruin the surprise). After came the two mains- we had the turbot and the suckling pig. Both were excellent! The mains were the highlight of the meal. Dessert was quite lacklustre in comparison. The almond cake might seem like a boring dessert but was lifted by inventive touches.  Wine pairing for the seduction menu includes four wines with refills , mostly spanish ones. Highly recommended as it was good value at only 30 euros.  Service was a bit of a letdown. The waiters were quite cold and did not seem very interested in the food. The assistant sommelier poured the wrong wine into our cup (a white into an existing red) though she did apologize and poured a fresh glass. We ordered ceylon tea but the waiter gave us a chinese tea instead- perhaps due to a language barrier. However they did try to take our dietary preferences into consideration. I mentioned that i disliked mint and they eliminated that from one of the dessert dishes. If you are planning to do this however, note that they seem to only eliminate the item and not replace it with something else.  All in all we paid 250 euros for 2 pax and it was great value for money ",2015-05-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or180-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26874,0.053,0.786,0.161,0.9902,0.12,0.6441304347826088,0.401615,1596,130,0.081453634085213,1,32,False,51,0.1034482758620689,0.1034482758620689,0.2413793103448276,0.0517241379310344,0.1206896551724138,0.0517241379310344,0.0517241379310344,0.0344827586206896,0.1724137931034483,0.0689655172413793,286,188,4.566433566433567,0,0,seduct menu wine pair other mention meal start eat busi card mayo like dip somewhat tasteless innov next came three snack favourit egg truffl cupcak top spinach foam waiter serv us entre sea rice onion soup hibiscu flower eponym dish sea rice realli awesom innov wont ruin surpris came two main turbot suckl pig excel main highlight meal dessert quit lacklustr comparison almond cake might seem like bore dessert lift invent touch wine pair seduct menu includ four wine refil mostli spanish one highli recommend good valu euro servic bit letdown waiter quit cold seem interest food assist sommeli pour wrong wine cup white exist red though apolog pour fresh glass order ceylon tea waiter gave us chines tea instead perhap due languag barrier howev tri take dietari prefer consider mention dislik mint elimin one dessert dish plan howev note seem elimin item replac someth els paid euro pax great valu money,average review,3

Absolutely delicious raciones & tapas, warm lively atmosphere, friendly quick service, and excellent value. This is the kind of local spot I love when we travel - homey and authentic. We stopped in for an early dinner 7:30-ish because another TA review had mentioned that Casa Toni serves fried baby squid (chopitos aka chiparones), which I had enjoyed all over Barcelona but have been unable to find in Madrid. We ended up ordering a couple of drinks, fried squid, fried anchovies, shrimp in garlic (gambas al ajillo), and eggplant, and all were excellent. The fried items were in a very light batter and perfectly crisp and non-greasy. We noticed that diners at the next tables had ordered yummy-looking fried peppers (pimientos al patron) and potatoes brava, which they said were delicious. Portions are generous, and the waiter wrapped up my leftovers for breakfast :) The sole drawback is that the place has only 5 tables and a bar - when we left at 8:30, it was crowded.
