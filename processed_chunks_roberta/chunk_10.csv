The place itself is bright and welcoming and this is reflected in the staff's service also.  We ordered one chicken, mayo and avocado arepas (needed to Google image it) and one Mexican meal consisting of a fried egg, black beans, rice and pulled pork. Wow. Both were utterly delicious!  Another group walked in after us and were treated with some very personal service when they couldn't find exactly what they wanted on the menu. The cook/waiter/owner (seemed to do it all well!) offered to throw together a personal salad for them using ingredients they had despite it not being listed on the menu.

It appears to be a take on 'Brew Dog' but falls waaaaay short of the mark. We were a family of four, and despite booking a table we had to wait, we were ignored for a good 10 minutes after checking in when we arrived. Whilst standing waiting we were watching the tv which was on the wall in the bar, goodness knows what channel was on but we were subjected to what I can only describe as a scantily clad 'big daddy' looky likey wearing nothing but a thong and gyrating towards the camera man, not pleasant to say the least. We were eventually shown to a table downstairs which quite clearly seated two as the staff went to find more chairs for us to squeeze our family of four round. We moved ourselves to an empty table of four to be told we could not have that as it was reserved for others. We were moved back to our original table, which I may add looked directly into the gents toilets, where the door stood open unless there was someone in. We couldn't figure out how 4 pizzas were to fit onto our table so we promptly left. The staff couldn't have been less helpful or friendly and made no effort to secure our custom. We felt that the restaurant was trying to squeeze as much people in as possible without any attention to customers whatsoever.

The staff were very friendly and as at a lot craft beer place, passionate about craft beer and very knowledgeable about what they had on tap and what should follow what (so you know, I don’t drink beer craft or otherwise, but I do visit quite a number of these establishments so I know a good craft beer people when I hear them). They had their own berr and so obviously my husband tried all of them and he said they were lovely. They had 15 beers of differing types and strengths. We visited more than once so quite a number were tried. The first night we were off to a particular restaurant and just stopped for drinks but as the beer was good as was the wine and the pizzas looked and smelled delicious, we stopped for pizza. We had the veggie pizza and the capricciosa without ham. Both pizzas were fantastic, a nice tomato sauce, lovely thin stone baked base and a good amount of toppings. They also have a very nice red wine which I drank - generally if craft beer places have red wine, it’s not the best quality but this was lovely. They also have and vodka and gin for the non beer drinking clientele which not every craft beer place has. They even made me a Tinto de Verano (if you have Fanta Lemoade in full view, you should definitely be prepared to have to make one, go on, you know you want to).

If however you want great Spanish food at reasonable prices with friendly, attentive service you need look no further. We ate here our second night in Madrid based on great Trip Advisor reviews and what a find it was! Hands down, the best meal while in Madrid. Located in the heart of the Chueca neighborhood, this tiny restaurant looks like nothing special from the outside and you easily might pass it by and not give it a thought if you were walking down the street. Either go early or book a reservation because the restaurant is very small and fills up quickly. Once you are seated and Hugo, the owner, comes to greet you, you are in for a real treat. Hugo lived in the US for a while and speaks perfect English. He is also very personable and takes great pains to explain everything on the menu which is entirely in Spanish, making suggestions along the way.  We had four dishes, all of them excellent. The goat cheese salad is a must. I believe the entire bill for two was less than 50 Euros. Amazing! Be sure to put this on your list whenever you are in Madrid.",2014-11-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or210-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9432,0.029,0.777,0.194,0.9917,0.2882010582010582,0.4744365079365079,0.3423846153846153,1153,105,0.0910667823070251,2,23,False,54,0.15,0.175,0.275,0.025,0.2,0.025,0.025,0.025,0.075,0.025,215,149,4.362790697674418,0,0,look fanci restaur central madrid place howev want great spanish food reason price friendli attent servic need look ate second night madrid base great trip advisor review find hand best meal madrid locat heart chueca neighborhood tini restaur look like noth special outsid easili might pass give thought walk street either go earli book reserv restaur small fill quickli seat hugo owner come greet real treat hugo live us speak perfect english also person take great pain explain everyth menu entir spanish make suggest along way four dish excel goat chees salad must believ entir bill two less euro amaz sure put list whenev madrid,very good review,5

More than tapas, but brighter and lighter than a traditional restaurant, it is authentically Spanish while being adventurous at the same time, and really REALLY good, with a flair that speaks of the El Bulli trained chef. I'd go back in a heartbeat, and if I were in Madrid, I could see that I would become a regular. Service is friendly and enthusiastic (and English speaking), and the food really is very special. The wine list is tiny but what there is is perfectly good (and not expensive). I was there on business, but I'd happily go with my husband on ""date night"", or with our daughter as a family visit.

We passed by earlier and it didn't look that special - we were so wrong! One of my most memorable dining experiences. The food is fantastic, but what makes this restaurant so special is the personal service and passion of Hugo. He eloquently describes each course in extreme detail. He clearly loves the business of food and is so knowledgeable. When I commented that the mussels were big and plumb, he explained what they ate, where they came from, etc. A few of our favorites were the tuna tartar with plantain chips, the mussels, the pork, the warm goat cheese and the chocolate desert with shaved coconut that is frozen.

The complementary meatball tapas with our drinks and the white wine recommended by Laura was excellent.  We then decided to have the menu of the day, choosing both choices from the menu for each of the courses so we could taste everything!  Every dish was made from scratch; light, fresh and full of flavour. We also were given an additional tapas at the table-Francisco's own croquette which were delicious! Great value at 11.50 euros each, including a drink -house white in our case, which was also very good-and 3 courses Laura and Francisco were warm and friendly hosts and their passion for food and great service shone through in their foods and we look forward to the next time we visit Madrid.

The place was quite busy, with people queuing outside to get a table, and there were a lot of locals amoung guests, which is always a good sign. We ordered patatas bravas (excellent!), tuna tanaki (great as well), ham croquettes (nice), sandwich with baby octopus (nice) and burrata stuffed with pesto (was a bit too intense taste for our liking, plus it felt slightly weird watching the waiter injecting your food from the large syringe in front of you :)). The dishes were arriving at different times, which I assume is ok for tapas, however, it was unusual for us to have potatoes with nothing to it and 20 minutes later have tuna served with no sides to it. Anyway, the food is enjoyable and sangria was lovely, albeit we had to remind staff about our drinks.

Doesn't look like much at first, but they have more seating in a more comfortable area in the back. Their kitchen is small, but all that means is your food is going to get the attention it deserves, though it may take a little while to get to you. They make sangria fresh, so you can get it without sugar. They brought a little appetizer to try - fried arepas cakes. They were declicious!! Sour cream sauce and an avocado sauce, OMG that was a great sign to a great meal coming. Four or five options for vegetarians, the arepas domino (black beans) was super good. The pork tenderloins with potatoes, carmelized onions and a goat cheese sauce, was outstanding. Got the half portion and it made me full. Less than 9 Euros for the 1/2 pork dish, 6 Euros for the arepas domino, and 5 Euros for the glass of Sangria (served in what must have been a 16 oz mug. Bill came to less than 19 Euros.

Well, dishes here are delicious and the largest we have had in 8 days in Spain.  (In San Sebastián, 5E gets you one bite of food. Here, 8E got us four separate corn pancake sandwiches.) We were full after that appetizer and then our huge main dishes arrived.  Servers are friendly and accommodating. We were so grateful they were willing to wrap up our leftovers as we hate wasting artfully prepared food (especially when it involves an animal giving its life for our dinner) and because we know to-go bags aren't a normal thing here. We preferred the cava sangria over the white wine sangria, but both were beautifully presented.  The restaurant looks tiny from the road, but has a large back room. We chose the front area as there was a fun vibe and music playing. If it looks full from the road, it's worth going in to ask if there's a table in the other room.

The dishes that we ordered per head is above the average in their taste and good presentation of the dishes for this matter i like to give them but the paella seafoods taste below the poor rated, i didnt like the way they serve it coz you can count the seafoods like 4 pieces of shrimps and 4 pieces of mussels and some cuttle fish that cut into small pieces. My friend ordered the tataki atun (in other language is just only a seared tuna with teriyaki sauce and a white sauce) i dont know why they have it on their menu using the teriyaki sauce so its mean that its not totally an spanish resto. Another thing, as we pass by to pay at the cashier we thought that the Sangria is home made but my friend saw it that they use the bottle sangria(the one that you can buy in the market) and pouring it into the carafe/pitcher added with some fruits and ice, so if youre thinking to get the sangria ill recomend you to buy it on the bar where you can see the barista’s working it by their hands and not an industrial hand. In overall ratings ill recomend you to try other resto to find a good paella and good Sangria hope they realize that the costumers has a high expectation when its come for the food and beverage section Godbless ",2018-08-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7204621-Reviews-or630-Rosi_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_9485,0.063,0.813,0.124,0.9647,0.072475845410628,0.4909299516908212,1.1389250000000002,1563,155,0.0991682661548304,0,15,False,57,0.1486486486486486,0.1621621621621621,0.2297297297297297,0.081081081081081,0.2162162162162162,0.027027027027027,0.027027027027027,0.027027027027027,0.054054054054054,0.027027027027027,303,163,4.158415841584159,0,0,friend search good resto around citi madrid consult app good resto la rosi loca up gambl everyth tri place dish like normal tast present food top order one dish per head paella dish seafood dish order per head averag tast good present dish matter like give paella seafood tast poor rate didnt like way serv coz count seafood like piec shrimp piec mussel cuttl fish cut small piec friend order tataki atun languag sear tuna teriyaki sauc white sauc dont know menu use teriyaki sauc mean total spanish resto anoth thing pass pay cashier thought sangria home made friend saw use bottl sangria one buy market pour caraf pitcher ad fruit ice your think get sangria ill recomend buy bar see barista work hand industri hand overal rate ill recomend tri resto find good paella good sangria hope realiz costum high expect come food beverag section godbless,average review,3

When we arrived there was a large queue but when we checked trip advisor saw that we could book a table for 10:00 online which we did.  The restaurant itself was lovely and service was extremely friendly. The waitress suggested around 4/5 tapas so we ordered burrata, patatas bravas, ham croquettes, chicken wings and beef tacos. All the food was delicious but the stand out dish was the burrata. It was absolutely fantastic! The food arrived as and when it was ready and the final dish to arrive was the beef tacos (2 in a portion) these were so tasty and a great end to the meal. The meal cost €44 for 2 beers, 1 cocktail, 1 coke and the 5 dishes which we thought was great value for money. We would’ve loved desserts but were too full to even look at the menu.

We settled on the gazpacho, the foie salad with mango, Mussels Tikka Masala (so off-the-wall, we had to try it), the rabbit, and the pork loin -- all excellent and excitingly flavored. For dessert: a chocolaty mousse and a sensational peach sorbet with a red wine reduction. Prices were very reasonable. We hated to call it a night. We were so impressed, we returned on our last night in Madrid -- we re-ordered some of the same dishes, but also enjoyed the tuna tartare, croquettes and spareribs. No less wonderful than the first night. This place is well-regarded by locals and appears quite humble from the outside (it's in the Chueca area) . However, venture in and you're in for a wonderful night.

We went early (at about 9:15pm) as we didn't have reservation.  The restaurant is not very big but the layout & service is amazing. We were led to a table right away and one of the staff came to explain the entire menu to us in English (the menu is in Spanish). I am a vegetarian but my husband is not. The maitre d serving us suggested some great dishes and ensured we had ordered enough.  We had the pan seared goats cheese, mushroom croquettes, guacamole with the plantain chips and pork skewers. The food was simply excellent. We wanted to try the grilled asparagus (it looked so nice) but we were stuffed. The maitre d recommned the mojito sorbet and insisted we tried it.

On our last night we wanted a definite hit so chose to go with a tripadvisor review and were not disappointed! Hero dishes included goat cheese in a basil honey sauce (I am goat cheese obsessed and this dish was one of the best I have ever had)! Also a winner was rabbit and I really dislike rabbit, to the extent I really tried to get my boyfriend to order something else.... But I think I might be converted!!  Service was fantastic... Knowledgeable and friendly. Only minus was the place did need a little music of something to liven the place up... Although the place was quite full so the chat made up for it. I recommend booking, as we hadn't and were very lucky to get a table ( we waited outside until they opened at 8.30pm, which seems crazy late to us Aussie/Pommes), but they were turning away tables whilst we were inside. The maitre d spoke brilliant English so calling and booking would be easy enough. Also wine was a really reasonable price!  Try this place, really great tapas and honestly brilliant value for money-we paid the same as a dinner in touristy crappy places, yet this place was a million times more refined and deliciois! Enjoy!

At his was our third and final night in Madrid, following a day we walk for over 6.5 miles... PERFECT for our last night ..  Walked in front, began selecting a seat in the bar area but we're very politely asked if we were there for more than drinks, which we were.. We were escorted to the dining area which was well in the back but extremely nice... Tiny with room for maybe 20 total.  Our wait person (we learned later was Carlos) was the nicest you could ask for (although it turned out, everyone was that way)... After an appropriate amount of time (drinks already in hand) we began to place our order.. My Prawns in garlic was to be a small dish (tapas possibly) and Liz began to order two large arapas... Carlos was a quick to say that she should try the ""other"" arapas which seemed in the menu to be small but a sampling of 4... It did cost less...  When delivered my prawns and garlic were 4 full prawns and 4 shrimp with ton of olive oil and tons of garlic.. If your mouth isn't watering you may want to order something else. But if it is, this will be better than I have described.. The selection of 4 arapas for Liz proved to be more than she could have handled for a meal... I ate the two meat filled (she's a vegetarian) and she had bread soaked in my olive oil and garlic.. We were both stuffed... One more round of drinks and, we asked for a check which was delivered with two shots of homemade Bailey's... Best ever and we bought a tiny bottle to take with us..  Okay, the good stuff.. Waitstaff.. Just ask for Carlos... There are 4 that work there.. We met two of them and there are no better servers anywhere.. Want to talk to the owner? Ask for Eddie... Eddie Dad, Momma, nephew, son and one other are all involved in the business... And we met all of them.. If I had this place near my home, I likely would be there more than home..

Trip Advisor gave us the idea for this one as we looked for a highly rated spot near where we were as we walked the Madrid streets. There is a bar area with a few tables and an area in the back with more tables. We are in the restaurant area.  The service here was wonderful and their English is good. They helped with the menu and they also allowed some modifications to get exactly what we wanted. We started with nachos with chicken and it was tasty. The small portion was plenty to share for 2-3 as an app.  We went with the chicken fajitas, the salmon with potatoes and veggies (be sure to specify how well you want the salmon cooked), and the Caesar salad. All were very good and enjoyed by all. We were extremely pleased with the nuanced flavors and beautiful presentations of the food.  The latte's to finish were perfect to finish a terrific lunch. This should go on your list as a great lunch spot and the prices were moderate and good value for the quality of the food.

It is in a great central location, so it's a fun and convenient to stop in for beers if you are in the area, or grabbing a pizza if it is meal time. The pizzas are decent, but being candid: this isn't an authentic wood fired/Neapolitan place - so set expectations accordingly. The Vulcano and Diavolo are strong choices, and there are a few other good options we have sampled.  The star here is the rotating taps of draft beers. Brew Wild has 15 taps, usual with a few IPAs of varying hoppiness, a pale ale or two, a session IPAs, doubles, ambers, pilsners, and an iambic or stout mixed in. They switch it up fairly frequently. They offer a good choice of bottled treats as well, but in my opinion the taps reign supreme. Being accustomed to US east coast craft breweries and a lot of beer diversity and availability of high quality draft beer, Brew Wild is a rare jewel in Madrid. I truly hope they get more competition in the central Madrid area - but as of now they are one of the few tap dominated establishments. You can find many other places with a decent bottle selection, or even the odd IPA on draft, but not with this much selection. Cheers to the staff, who routinely seem to know the beers and are super friendly. We have always had samples offered and great recommendations made based on our tastes and beer moods. Prices are ok to slightly high, but considering they really have little competition it is understood.",2018-07-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12493147-Reviews-or70-Brew_Wild_Pizza_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_9522,0.014,0.802,0.184,0.9956,0.182390350877193,0.4511403508771929,0.5430384615384616,1513,135,0.0892267019167217,0,37,False,44,0.21875,0.171875,0.328125,0.078125,0.140625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046875,0.015625,279,181,4.422939068100359,0,0,brew wild time write overdu review great central locat fun conveni stop beer area grab pizza meal time pizza decent candid authent wood fire neapolitan place set expect accordingli vulcano diavolo strong choic good option sampl star rotat tap draft beer brew wild tap usual ipa vari hoppi pale ale two session ipa doubl amber pilsner iambic stout mix switch fairli frequent offer good choic bottl treat well opinion tap reign suprem accustom us east coast craft breweri lot beer divers avail high qualiti draft beer brew wild rare jewel madrid truli hope get competit central madrid area one tap domin establish find mani place decent bottl select even odd ipa draft much select cheer staff routin seem know beer super friendli alway sampl offer great recommend made base tast beer mood price ok slightli high consid realli littl competit understood,good review,4

We had the guacamole, which was served with crispy plantain slices, tuna tartare, which was delicious but leaned heavily toward mustard, might not order it next time, a goat cheese salad which was everyone's favorite, tiki marsala mussels which was a very close second favorite, the octopus with potato foam which tasted a lot like gourmet macaroni and cheese with octopus in every best sense of the word, and we may have ordered more because it felt like the dishes kept coming at a wonderfully relaxing rate.

My girlfriend and I both love food and when I narrowed the places to eat in Madrid to the neighborhood we were staying in, this popped up as the top option. The name stood out, and the glowing reviews solidified our choice of dinner for one of our only two nights in Madrid. We were greeted very warmly by the staff and immediately felt right at home in this relatively small, and simply decorated restaurant. Hugo, one of the owners came out and chatted with us a bit. He spoke perfect English and translated the whole menu from Spanish and gave us detailed descriptions of the food. There are a number of different dishes on the menu designed to be shared; we picked a couple that sounded perfect. We had the Foie Gras, the Goat Cheese, the Tikka Masala Mussels, the Octopus with Potato Foam, and the Pork Skewers. For dessert we had the Chocolate Foam and the Mojito Sorbet. It was a lot of food, but we left happily stuffed. Every dish was incredibly well prepared and each was equally as good as the last. Presentation was incredible! I have had the opportunity through work and life to eat at a number of very good and well known restaurants. This was hands down among the best meals I have ever had! Hugo had a passion for all of the food and was very concerned with our dining experience and whether we enjoyed each dish. But, more importantly, when we left and thanked him, he made sure to point out that he was just a part of the experience and that his partner, cooking in the kitchen, as well as his staff, were also a big part of the evening. I cannot say enough good things about this place. The only downside is that we had to fly home the next day and could not enjoy it again. The price for the evening (with a bottle of wine) was incredibly reasonable for a multi course menu. It's by no means a cheap place to eat, but for what we received it was a steal! When I come back to Madrid this will be the first place I come to eat. I highly recommend giving this place shot, you will not be disappointed.",2014-09-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or220-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9537,0.035,0.785,0.18,0.9962,0.3093975468975469,0.536453823953824,0.5118714285714286,2080,203,0.0975961538461538,3,43,False,87,0.1263157894736842,0.1473684210526315,0.3263157894736842,0.0526315789473684,0.1473684210526315,0.031578947368421,0.0105263157894736,0.031578947368421,0.0842105263157894,0.0421052631578947,393,227,4.295165394402035,0,0,incred lucki stumbl upon restaur ta girlfriend love food narrow place eat madrid neighborhood stay pop top option name stood glow review solidifi choic dinner one two night madrid greet warmli staff immedi felt right home rel small simpli decor restaur hugo one owner came chat us bit spoke perfect english translat whole menu spanish gave us detail descript food number differ dish menu design share pick coupl sound perfect foie gra goat chees tikka masala mussel octopu potato foam pork skewer dessert chocol foam mojito sorbet lot food left happili stuf everi dish incred well prepar equal good last present incred opportun work life eat number good well known restaur hand among best meal ever hugo passion food concern dine experi whether enjoy dish importantli left thank made sure point part experi partner cook kitchen well staff also big part even cannot say enough good thing place downsid fli home next day could enjoy price even bottl wine incred reason multi cours menu mean cheap place eat receiv steal come back madrid first place come eat highli recommend give place shot disappoint,very good review,5

As others have said, Hugo the owner speaks perfect english and is totally passionate about his food and restaurant. He explained the entire menu, and then left us to choose, saying that he would guide us with the amount to order. The food is for sharing, and just appears at intervals, so we started with the foie gras - amazing! And judged perfectly - just the right amount of melba toast to go with it. As we were finishing that the goat’s cheese appeared - fantastic! It had a crispy top, and coated in a basil oil and honey dressing - just delicious. Well flavoured, but perfectly balanced. Having read reviews of the orange salad we chose that - very lovely, but slightly too rich after our first 2 courses - maybe better suited to follow something like the guacamole. We also tried the tikka mussels - huge mussels, beautifully presented, fabulous sauce. We then had pork skewers, advised by Hugo to order just 1 each - he was spot on. We shared 2 desserts - strawberry and cola, very odd when you just tasted the cola reduction - then stunning when you added in the strawberry mix! Also the mango soup with yogurt ice cream. This is very clever cooking, in an unfussy setting. The tables are close together, so don't go for a romantic evening or if you want lots of space around you. The atmosphere was fun and buzzy, the other staff lovely and friendly and smiling at our attempts to communicate. Great place, fantastic food, really worth visiting - it's just a few mins walk off Gran Via.

After a few minutes with him you'd probably stay if he were serving cheese whiz on ritz crackers. Instead, the culinary creations you're about to be presented with are likely to be your tastebud's highlight of your time in Madrid. We arrived with no reservation, but were told ""no problem"" which was only because of the early hour we arrived. Within 30 minutes there wasn't a seat left open in the house. Hugo explained every item on the menu in English to us while simultaneously seeming to direct the effort of every employee in the restaurant and keeping tabs on the happiness of all his customers. We started with the guacamole which was butter smooth, rich with flavor, and made just a bit more interesting by the plantain chips. We also got the tiki muscles and pork skewers, both of which would have been the stand alone star in most restaurants, but in my opinion best dish of the meal was the orange salad. Sure, I could try to describe it, but have you ever tried to describe a sunset or the feeling of a warm shower after a long day? The only way to know it is to experience it!

We spotted this bar while walking around and I am SO happy we stopped in for a beer. We got there right as they opened so one of the owners/partners just hung out and chatted with us for a while while updating the tap list (they also have an awesome bottle collection- check it out!). He was SO nice and knew a ton about the craft beer scene in Spain. He talked to us about different breweries in Madrid and Barcelona and had us sample a couple beers. We have traveled to breweries and craft beer bars all around the world and Brew Wild was one of my all-time favorite experiences.  The beer was all fabulous and the atmosphere of the bar was great. Wonderful music and a neat aesthetic. The basement is super cool- it looks just like a cave!

The drinks were ridiculously generous and dinner concluded with two free shots of Bailey's, I think. The servers were charming, fluent in English. The place was full of happy people.

Upon entering you discover a very cozy and modern little restaurant which is always packed with people waiting for a table. The service at this restaurant was probably the best I've ever had.

The food here is great! We went on our first night in Madrid and we enjoyed it so much that we went back the next night, too. The part owner/waiter speaks great English and will translate the entire menu for you. The other waiter didn't speak much English, but was very friendly and helpful. All in all, the service was great. They eat late in Spain, so it wasn't a problem for us to get a table when they opened at 8:30 for dinner. The second night we got there a little later (I think at about 9:30) and there was only one free table (thank goodness). We were in Madrid during the week, so I can imagine that it may be harder to get a table on Fri/Sat/Sun nights as they only have table seating for about 20, plus a little bar space (maybe 6 or so). The first night we had their special tuna tartar and my husband enjoyed it so much that he wanted to order it again the second night. I tried patatas bravas in several other restaurants during our time in Barcelona and Madrid and I enjoyed it here the most. The octopus in the cheese sauce topped with a generous sprinkling of paprika was wonderful. I generally don't like squid or octopus because of the chewiness, but this dish was cooked so well that the octopus was not chewy. We also had the ribs, fajitas (which were more like quesadillas in my opinion), mussels, and goat cheese salad. Beware of the ribs -- the portion was big. We had already had the tuna tartar, a small order of the patatas bravas (which comfortably served two), and the octopus before the ribs came out. I wasn't expecting the ribs to be so big, nor did I expect the side of mashed potatoes. Everything we had was yummy, bursting with various flavors that blended so well together.  The price was not bad for the food that you got and I felt like it was a really good value. From my recollection, the dishes range from about 10 to 15 Euros, with the full-sized meals (like the ribs) at about 20 Euros (maybe even less). The small order of the patatas bravas was only 5 Euros though. Note that they do have a bread charge of 1.50 Euros per person, but they just bring the bread to you and don't mention that part. All in all, my husband and I highly recommend this restaurant.",2013-08-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or300-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9616,0.009,0.795,0.196,0.9985,0.1694250253292806,0.4434802431610942,0.3883954545454546,2284,216,0.0945709281961471,1,71,False,103,0.0923076923076923,0.1384615384615384,0.2307692307692307,0.0615384615384615,0.1692307692307692,0.0153846153846153,0.1076923076923077,0.0307692307692307,0.1076923076923077,0.0461538461538461,431,232,4.299303944315545,0,0,let exterior small simpl interior cor place fool food great went first night madrid enjoy much went back next night part owner waiter speak great english translat entir menu waiter speak much english friendli help servic great eat late spain problem us get tabl open dinner second night got littl later think one free tabl thank good madrid week imagin may harder get tabl fri sat sun night tabl seat plu littl bar space mayb first night special tuna tartar husband enjoy much want order second night tri patata brava sever restaur time barcelona madrid enjoy octopu chees sauc top gener sprinkl paprika wonder gener like squid octopu chewi dish cook well octopu chewi also rib fajita like quesadilla opinion mussel goat chees salad bewar rib portion big alreadi tuna tartar small order patata brava comfort serv two octopu rib came expect rib big expect side mash potato everyth yummi burst variou flavor blend well togeth price bad food got felt like realli good valu recollect dish rang euro full size meal like rib euro mayb even less small order patata brava euro though note bread charg euro per person bring bread mention part husband highli recommend restaur,very good review,5

My wife is vegetarian and there were plenty of options. We shared goats cheese balsamic salad with a honey crust...divine! patatas bravas with spicy chill and rich mayo salsas...wow! asparagus with parmesan shavings and more balsamic...yum! marinated pork skewers...again divine! White wine was rueda verdejo, excellent. we didnt need a desert but he insisted on one on the house which was an explosive mojito sorbet...stunning. Bill in total was under 60 €, really good value considering location and quality of food. throughout the owner told us about the business, its evolution, his training - hes a chef too - he has been friends with the chef/partner for 23 years...its a winning combination. We were that impressed that we were going to book for friday, but they close today for summer holidays (normal in Madrid) until 22 August. we will be there then!!! You have to admire places like this, the effort on service and food really makes it a must visit.

A very few are above average, but this one is perhaps the best we had during this stay. One warning: if you see the appearance of the street and the building, it will mislead you! But do go in, say that you did/did not reservate and look for a table. The waiters (especially the shorter one) is very very friendly. He speaks over three languages (at least Spanish, Catalan, English and French) and do everything to help you to make your best choice. He also helps you to order enough for your appetite at that moment, but also not to much. Now something about the food. It is tasteful in any ways. No unnecessary fried thing, but cooked as a chef. That's what we like. You can order your dishes per person, but it is more usual to share it with your table partner. The house wine was extremely good for a vino tinto de la casa. And now the smash: order the chocolate mousse as a dessert. Ask the waiter what is in it, be surprised and do order it! You will have an excellent dinner in a restaurant with an atmosphere you would not expect. Perhaps that is the only minus. Maybe they will light the hanging lamps instead of the TL-lamps; that would improve enormously I think.

It's a very small place with maybe twenty seats maximum. We got lucky and walked in off the street. We had to wait for a table but thankfully we were just two people and hit it just right. Definitely call ahead and make a reservation if you can. Your hotel can do it but they also speak English if you need to do so. If you like thoughtful and inspired food served as it is cooked, then you will like this place! This is not a place for a quick dinner because Spaniards actually enjoy food and dining together. Our meal was well-paced, easy, and fun. The owner took very good care of us and pretty much every table in the restaurant.  I speak decent Spanish but the owner clearly wanted to speak English so he could really explain the menu. I really appreciated that because it was clear how proud he was of his food. His English is excellent. It turns out he lived not far from us in DC a few years back. He was very helpful and really took pains to help us order the right amount of food. He even talked us out of something because he thought we might have too much. He was right! I disagree with other reviewers (on Yelp) who may have found him to be pushy. He was not pushy at all and really took the time to help us and have a nice chat. The prices were very reasonable given the exchange rate between euros and dollars. We had plenty to eat and drink for about 67 euros and we're two guys. Everything was impeccably cooked and plated. My favorites were the pig's ears (try them if they are offering them that night!) the queso de cabra (which is grilled and drizzled in honey) and the secreto iberico (pork brochette) but the rabbit was delicious too. In short, eat here if you want something fun, relaxed, and delicious!

The atmosphere was charming, the servers were kind, the food was decent though not spectacular, and then... the hair.  I can accept that these things happen, but when a long, black, kinky hair is clearly buried in the middle of my iberico ham croquette, I start to question how it got baked in there, and for how long it's actually been in there... it's not like it fell in on the way to the table. I didn't make much of a fuss, because we did enjoy what we had (again, a 6-7/10) but then we got the calamari which also had a hair, albeit a different length and color, fried into the batter. I think everyone has to draw a line somewhere, and this is where I drew mine. My husband and I couldn't bring ourselves to eat anything further. We had such high hopes, but I must admit, we weren't blown away, with or without hair.  I ended up having a second dinner afterwards elsewhere... so I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars- just as it gave me 2 hairs.

I ordered at 1100 kg steak medium rare. I received a Rib Steak rare and not a T bone steak. The steak I received were not cut and laid in order. They were all cut into pieces and was presented laying in all different directions. This shows that that we most did not receive the full 1100 kg steak. This is ridiculous. Besides that I told the waiters and they were trying to convince me that it was a T bone steak. They tried to convince me continuously until I told them that I’m a professional chef and I was here in Spain for a chefs seminar with Gordon Blue. I told them that I knew what I ordered and I knew what I received and it was definitely not a T bone steak. At the end they removed the steaks from the fridge for display so that other customers will not be able to see the steak that they order. Everyone needs to be careful what they order and what they receive. ,2020-01-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5827906-Reviews-or10-Steak_Burger_Fuencarral-Madrid.html,UID_9669,0.024,0.908,0.068,0.7517,0.1685897435897436,0.596153846153846,0.2797727272727272,916,105,0.1146288209606987,0,12,False,25,0.1428571428571428,0.0476190476190476,0.4285714285714285,0.0476190476190476,0.1904761904761904,0.0476190476190476,0.0476190476190476,0.0,0.0476190476190476,0.0,181,93,4.060773480662983,0,0,came good steak steakburg order kg steak medium rare receiv rib steak rare bone steak steak receiv cut laid order cut piec present lay differ direct show receiv full kg steak ridicul besid told waiter tri convinc bone steak tri convinc continu told profession chef spain chef seminar gordon blue told knew order knew receiv definit bone steak end remov steak fridg display custom abl see steak order everyon need care order receiv,bad review,2

Our experience was very disappointing. I love hamburgers. I´m the kind of guy that when I travel in the US, I will ask people where the best burger joint in town is. So I think I know a good burger, and while these guys market the product right, it was not very good. I admit, I like my meat cooked well, so when it comes back rare, we obviously are getting off to a bad start. And when it comes back the second time only medium, they´ve pretty much lost me. But truly, our burger lacked flavor and was just not appetizing. The fries portion is very small, think McDonalds regular size envelope.  The service was friendly and efficient and the bathrooms were very clean. Its a great location for access to Atocha and other main sights, and they have outdoor seating. We had walked by several of these and I was anxious to give it a try. Been there, done that. I won´t be back. There are just too many better options for burgers in Madrid, in my opinion.

We saw this restaurant and liked the look of it and wanted to book it for my birthday meal. I went in at 5pm and asked for a table for later than evening. A member of staff made a note of the booking, asking my name and the number of people and I watched him write it down on the reservations. Later on when my friends and I arrived 3 hours later, they had no note or memory of my booking. They told us we'd have to wait for a table. We waited 15 minutes and asked again, the waiter was very rude and said he was 'looking'. We could see that no one was looking. The waiter then asked another colleague to deal with us, she said she hadn't heard anything and would look.

He was good at explaining the difference between beef and ox, the two hooved meat options. I ordered the LaSuiza, a burger with lettuce, tomato, carmelized onions, and cheeses. When it was ready the waiter brought it and, separately, a very small cast iron skillet where the cheeses had been prepared. After putting down the burger tray he mixed the cheeses together and drizzled them over the burger. I asked for the medium-sized patty to be cooked to Medium, but it came rare. Despite that it was delicious! I definitely recommend the ox burger patty - very lean. My wife's small-size ox burger, whose name I didn't record, came with arugula, tomato, carmelized onions, and provolone. Hers was cooked perfectly and she said it was terrific, the arugula offsetting the other flavors. My daughter ordered the Grilled Chicken Burger, which came with bacon, bourbon mayo, and gouda. She said it was a good meld of flavors and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I also ordered a sangria, which was one of the best I've had. All this goodness was offset by the waiter not asking us partway through the meal how everything was, and when we were done, the plates were cleared by another server. We waited about 10-15 minutes for the check, which was never brought, even though our waiter had walked by our table countless times and looked several times at the empty table. He did deliver and collect payment from another group who arrived after us. Two attempts to stop him were fruitless, and I ended up catching the eye of the only waitress I saw. She was very friendly and attentive. I would eat there again, but only if I didn't get the same waiter.

Well our friends in our current stay in Madrid suggested this place for a decent pizza. And there we went. Little they knew, much less us, that the restaurant has an enchanting basement with multiple, exposed, brick-made vaults with tables in between, an interesting dining situation, indeed. Run by relative young people, the restaurant not only specializes in a small and select menu list but they also offer artisanal beers, including some brewed by themselves. And from our conversation, I can tell they do know their trade. Important to mention, their pizza is as artisanal as they get, thin-crusted delights perfectly cooked with fresh ingredients. And this was a surprising turn. All in all, not only we enjoyed with satisfaction a superior version of the italian inspired dish, but the service was adequate and the ambiance unforgettable. Thus, when in this city obsessed with food you need a break from the abundant spanish menu, do not hesitate to consider Brew Wild Pizza Bar, despite their somewhat kitsch name and the small entrance.

We called to book half an hour before and it was a good idea as it is a small and very popular restaurant that gets full quickly.

How can another review make any difference in swaying or even confirming opinion? Why even bother adding another rave notice? Indeed, why make it even harder to get a table here, once word meets critical mass, and it fully gains the recognition it deserves? But I went for only my second time last night, and I wanted to share my thoughts about WHY this place is such a phenomenon.  The food is undoubtedly excellent. From the regular dishes it serves the best: Quacamole I have ever tasted (tried twice, confirmed twice). The most interesting way of serving octopus (bar perhaps an octopus curry fresh from the sea I once had in Zanzibar) I have ever had, and certainly ever had in Spain. With a creamy potato foam.  The quite amazing Mojito sorbet, which is the essential way to finish a meal here. But last night I also sampled the special of Ortiguillas de mar - ""deep-fried sea anemones"". I've had this a few times down in Cadiz, which is famous for it. But these were the best I've tasted. There's a trick to doing these well, I learned from the owner, who explained that he had been researching corn flour - which provides the coating - in Galicia and Asturias, regions in the north of Spain. And he had found a really light flour that makes these delicate little treats something else.  Now, this might sound a bit nerdy, and of little importance. But for me it pointed to why I think this place is very special. Spain is very traditional in its approach to food, and certain regions are known for certain foods. The best ham comes from Extremadura; the best olive oil from Jaen, the best black pudding from Burgos, etc. These are articles of faith for the Spanish. And food tends to be cooked well or badly depending on how faithfully the chef sticks to the traditions of cooking the dish. Which rather stifles innovation, and means there's less cross-pollination from different regions. The chef is from Catalunia, Barcelona; but evidently has a very open mind about taking the best from everywhere, trying new things and evolving Spanish cuisine. He takes staples of the Spanish table - patatas bravas, etc. - and adds his own twist, and suddenly you realise how bored you have got with most of the staple tapas fare in Madrid.  That's the first thing, the chef's exploratory, innovative outlook. The second was the very fact that he bothered to explain this to me in a busy restaurant on a Saturday night. I was just another guiri (foreigner) punter, but his pride in his food and his enthusiasm to share this was impressive. He took the same care with every table. He explains everything on the menu in perfect English to every table, and makes everyone feel very welcome and cared for. You might forgive a chef of such creative flair to keep in the background, and let his food speak for itself. You might even forgive him a certain arrogance (not unknown in his profession). But instead, he adds exceptional, very personalised service to extraordinary quality and value.  This place deserves every plaudit. It deserves to be famous. Go there before it gets too famous (but not all at once, please). I dread the day when it is impossible to get a table.",2014-03-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or250-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9760,0.041,0.741,0.218,0.9992,0.2393663820747154,0.5319957049123717,0.4630702702702702,3296,267,0.081007281553398,0,96,False,98,0.0825688073394495,0.146788990825688,0.3302752293577982,0.036697247706422,0.1651376146788991,0.018348623853211,0.036697247706422,0.036697247706422,0.110091743119266,0.036697247706422,582,337,4.6563573883161515,0,0,gener hate agre peopl follow herd place deserv great thing peopl say anoth review make differ sway even confirm opinion even bother ad anoth rave notic inde make even harder get tabl word meet critic mass fulli gain recognit deserv went second time last night want share thought place phenomenon food undoubtedli excel regular dish serv best quacamol ever tast tri twice confirm twice interest way serv octopu bar perhap octopu curri fresh sea zanzibar ever certainli ever spain creami potato foam quit amaz mojito sorbet essenti way finish meal last night also sampl special ortiguilla de mar deep fri sea anemon time cadiz famou best tast trick well learn owner explain research corn flour provid coat galicia asturia region north spain found realli light flour make delic littl treat someth els might sound bit nerdi littl import point think place special spain tradit approach food certain region known certain food best ham come extremadura best oliv oil jaen best black pud burgo etc articl faith spanish food tend cook well badli depend faith chef stick tradit cook dish rather stifl innov mean less cross pollin differ region chef catalunia barcelona evid open mind take best everywher tri new thing evolv spanish cuisin take stapl spanish tabl patata brava etc add twist suddenli realis bore got stapl tapa fare madrid first thing chef exploratori innov outlook second fact bother explain busi restaur saturday night anoth guiri foreign punter pride food enthusiasm share impress took care everi tabl explain everyth menu perfect english everi tabl make everyon feel welcom care might forgiv chef creativ flair keep background let food speak might even forgiv certain arrog unknown profess instead add except personalis servic extraordinari qualiti valu place deserv everi plaudit deserv famou go get famou pleas dread day imposs get tabl,very good review,5

It is about a 15 minute walk from central Madrid that requires walking through a busy but rather sketchy area, but proved to be well worth the effort. It is located in a narrow space with a small number of tables, and the owner / chef Hugo's friendly greeting and enthusiasm makes you feel welcome and valued instantly. There is a rather ancient menu in Spanish, but Hugo clearly enjoys translating not just the words but the intention behind the unique and creative dishes. The menu has traditional fare, variations on traditional fare and some very original creations. Our group of 3 couples particularly enjoyed the Guacamole with Plantain Chips, and the Fresh Tuna Tartare in a light mustard sauce. The atmosphere is basic, the dress very casual, and the servers young, happy and hard-working. After discussing the cuisine among ourselves, we agreed that the best description of the food would be ""gourmet,"" despite the simple surroundings. An added bonus for the language-impaired is that Hugo has lived in The US and the UK, so he speaks English perfectly",2014-06-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or240-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9768,0.0,0.677,0.323,0.9979,0.2191964285714285,0.5591836734693878,0.121425,1140,85,0.0745614035087719,0,25,False,28,0.1333333333333333,0.1555555555555555,0.3555555555555555,0.1333333333333333,0.0888888888888888,0.0222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,192,137,4.942708333333333,0,0,tri restaur whim read interest review minut walk central madrid requir walk busi rather sketchi area prove well worth effort locat narrow space small number tabl owner chef hugo friendli greet enthusiasm make feel welcom valu instantli rather ancient menu spanish hugo clearli enjoy translat word intent behind uniqu creativ dish menu tradit fare variat tradit fare origin creation group coupl particularli enjoy guacamol plantain chip fresh tuna tartar light mustard sauc atmospher basic dress casual server young happi hard work discuss cuisin among agre best descript food would gourmet despit simpl surround ad bonu languag impair hugo live us uk speak english perfectli,good review,4

Viewed from Calle Pelayo, ""Gastromaquia"" immediately registers as quite compact, and not exactly prepossessing . But what it may seem to lack in appearances, it more than makes-up in the quality of its deliciously tasty food offering, and notably also, in the warm, entertaining front-of-house presence of its co-owner, Hugo. Bear in mind, this place is tiny : a narrow, brightly decorated, noisy area with plastic tables & chairs -at a push it could seat 25 people. We were allocated a table at the back, were given Menus (en Espanol), and while waiting for our host, Hugo, to come and explain all to us, ordered some wine from the limited available choices. Hugo, and his co-owner Chef Ramon (they met at ""Culinary School"") are the stars of the show here. The former leads you through an item by item description (in English) of the many Tapas choices - a performance in itself - while his Partner behind the scenes, as we discovered, produces some of the most tasty food you could find in Madrid! Our quite conservative choices were ""Foie con Tostas"", a Rabbit dish, a Goat's Cheese dish, some Skewered Meat, and on Hugo's recommendation, a Guacamole concoction. We were impressed with the flavours in all cases - these guys are certainly a great advert for the concept that several smaller courses conjured-up by a talented Chef, can be far superior to larger plates in lesser hands. This was indeed food for highly enjoyable ""grazing""! A glass of the ""House White"", a bottle of Ribera del Duero, some agua sin gas, + an espresso all added to our enjoyment. We were also fortunate to have an opportunity for a brief chat with Hugo later, when the ongoing demands for his attention eased-off a bit. He's an absolutely fascinating man, proud of what he does, knowledgeable about Spain's history, more than willing to debate, and generous in openly acknowledging this is not a ""one man show"" - both he, and his Partner, Ramon, are both from Barcelona, by the way. Our Bill for this evening - highly entertaining on many levels - was a more than reasonable Euro 66-15 (before adding a Tip for our attentive Waiter).

Next we got mussels and they were the best mussels I have ever had in my life. I'm a huge seafood fanatic and wow muy bueno. It's served with bread so once you finish the mussels dip the bread in the sauce, it really tops it off. Lastly we got the octopus which I wasn't a huge fan of but I'm not a huge octopus fan in the first place.... but my friend loved it said it was one of the best ever.

Just got off the plane and straight to this fun tapas bar, that was just a couple of steps from our hotel at Sol. If this is any indication to what the food here is like I think we are off to a great start. I will start with the service. We were a group of twelve. Made reservations in advance for 23:30. arrived 20 min late due to delay at the airport but were still welcomed with a smile . restaurant was packed. Laura, our lovely waitress came and took our very big order Helping out with our decisions. Everything came out at once. no mistakes. The food- absolutely delicious and Nicely presented. We tried many of the dishes on the menu and highly recommend the following: Pesto stuffed borata with cherry tomatoes.  Grilled pork tenderloin, ceviche and fried calamari. BBQ Chicken wings were also tasty. Only dish that was just fine was the sesame tuna tataki which was a bit bland. Otherwise great food served to the middle of the table to share. Portion size was pretty big for tapas and I recommend up to two dishes pp if you are hungry. price is very reasonable ranging between 3-8 euros for most dishes. Drinks were good too and had plenty of alcohol. Mojitos, Daiquiris and caipirinhas were all served in big glasses for 7 euros each. Atmosphere- young crowd, on the load side.

If you want to be sure to get a seat, you need to reserve. When we left Saturday there was a queue outside. It is a very small place, English is well spoken and the entire menu plus specials are explained to you. Besides some traditional tapas or pintxos there are also some very interesting dishes. The waiter was good to inform us that we were ordering too much and should reduce to 4-5 dishes for the two us as some of them were quite big.

Yes was my fault as i was not paying attention when a beggar/gypsy came in and put a piece of paper down on the table on top of my phone the paper was written in Spanish of course i just waved him of and of course when he picked up the paper my phone went as well.What annoys me most apart from my stupidity was the fact a waiter was standing at the door and let the said beggar,gypsy in to the restaurant,when i discovered the phone gone the waiter was not at all helpful.Then a waitress who spoke decent English came over to help she called the police,who would not attend as there was no violence used she also comped my bill which she did not have to do.So to finish up great burgers great service in a busy place just be very careful with your belongings.

The food was that good we went 2 nights in a row. Compliments to the chef the burgers are the best burgers I have ever tasted. The mozzarella sticks are amazing and the food comes to the table so quick!! I also recommend the frozen daiquiris. The first night the waitress was lovely and the lady did her best to try some English. The second night we went (Monday 7th Sept) the young waiter who seemed to be the only one there at 8pm (the place was quiet and other staff arrived later) he had a face like thunder. Didn't greet us with a smile, couldn't care less about what we actually wanted. He came over to take our order and I asked him politely if he would like our drink order first or food and he said 'I don't care'. This made my boyfriend and I feel very uncomfortable and felt it was a hassle to ask him for another drink. So we left as soon as we ate out food and our night was ruined. We couldn't wait to leave. I would have given 5 stars if it hadn't been for the waiters attitude. It stunk basically. We gave the chef his top on the way out as he deserved it more.

It was our last night in Madrid and we had not yet had paella so our hotel desk clerk recommended a place as there are very many places in the area that offer paella on the menu. However, after checking the reviews on tripadvisor we found Rosi La Loca and wow how lucky were we. There was a 10 minute wait without a reservation but once we were seated the sangria flowed deliciously, the atmosphere was awesome and the paella was freaking delicious! Our waiter Monty was probably the best, most welcoming waiter I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and completely sealed the whole experience for us. Rosi La Loca should feel very proud and lucky to have such a wonderfully polite, conversational, and professional employee. The restaurant was very clean and has more seating than what is seen from the street. Although the seating is a bit tight, it gives way for great conversations with seated neighbors who are from other parts of the world. We only had the paella and sangria but every dish on tables nearby looked and smelled delicious as well. Overall I would say this gem of a restaurant should definitely be on your list of ""must do"" for Madrid.

They have an interesting menu, and everything is delicious! We started with patatas bravas, which were good, but the goat cheese with pesto and honey was TO DIE FOR! It was rich, but man oh man was it scrumptious! Next we had the tikka masala mussels, and sliced octopus in some sort of cheese sauce. Unfortunately, I had somewhat higher expectations for the mussels…the seasoning wasn't quite right, and it was a little watery, but still good. The octopus was done very well, nice and tender, with a nice balance of spicy and creamy. Finally, we finished a mojito sorbet, which was so refreshing. Having lived in South Florida for several years, I was astounded that we hadn't seen this on a menu before. It is very creative, and was an excellent end to our delicious meal!",2014-01-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1024062-Reviews-or260-Gastromaquia-Madrid.html,UID_9876,0.056,0.662,0.283,0.9958,0.3095119047619048,0.6180952380952381,0.6764727272727273,1067,91,0.0852858481724461,4,35,False,27,0.131578947368421,0.1842105263157894,0.3684210526315789,0.0526315789473684,0.131578947368421,0.0,0.0526315789473684,0.0,0.0789473684210526,0.0,186,128,4.741935483870968,0,0,fool unassum exterior restaur littl skeptic upon arriv certainli hidden treasur first owner server welcom realli spend time explain menu make suggest although mean pushi interest menu everyth delici start patata brava good goat chees pesto honey die rich man oh man scrumptiou next tikka masala mussel slice octopu sort chees sauc unfortun somewhat higher expect mussel season quit right littl wateri still good octopu done well nice tender nice balanc spici creami final finish mojito sorbet refresh live south florida sever year astound seen menu creativ excel end delici meal,very good review,5

We ate here twice on our trip to Madrid. The restaurant is small and cozy and the food incredible. The first night we ate here was a weekend, and the place was pretty crowded so we waited for a table. The second time was a mid-week dinner and the place was not as busy. So I would definitely suggest making a reservation on weekends. The food was simple and delicious. Ugo, the owner, is a gracious and humble guy just putting out great food every night. He spent time in the U.S., so his english is fluent, and he walked us through the menu, made spot on recommendations and accurately judged how much our party should order. There was not a single dish we did not care for or even thought to be merely average. Prices are also extremely reasonable, especially for the city.

The food is tasty however and the staff are very helpful and some speak good English.

As soon as we walked in, the delicious smell of their cooking filled the air and made our mouth water. I like the way they seemed to place family with children in one area and another one without, which is kind of great. After a warm welcoming, we got the menus and this is something they need to improve. We got colour photocopies, with even a page on its own (I guess their budget is big enough to order some proper menus) I really think they should improve this (something they should also do in the original restaurant). Quick service and delicious food almost exactly as in Calle Palencia. However, we were a bit shocked by how small and thin our desserts were. I order the pistachio cheesecake and it was so tiny that it couldn’t even stand on it own. That’s the second thing to improve.

I adventured to this little hole in the wall in a quite street a few blocks down from the Gran Via, early in the evening to secure a seat and being the only one there I sat by the bar. This only added to my positive experience for the waiting staff were so welcoming, friendly and attentive I didn't feel I was eating alone, but amongst friends. This is something very special when you travel alone and therefore eat out alone. Besides the excellent service and welcome when I arrived, each plate that came was so creative, with an amazing blend of textures and flavors. You can tell there are some brains working in the kitchen to produce such delicacies. The grilled goats cheese was so rich and wholesome with a green sweet sauce that set off the dish. Having fresh crispy baguette served with the meal provided the perfect accompaniment and there is nothing more tasty then creamy cheese on same day fresh bread. The mushroom croquettes were so creamy with the thinnest of crispy batter on the outside. Compliments of the kitchen I had the fortune of trying their tomato stuffed with guacamole croquette which was so fresh and innovative.  An advice, if after all the plates your so full you couldn't eat another thing... then you must ignore this feeling and try the chocolate whip! Its like eating chocolate air with crunchy croutons and a hint of foreign salt. Its so light you can enjoy the flavour without feeling any fuller.... now for the palat cleanser MOJITO SORBET. Zingy combination of what tasted like mint, lemon and a shot of bacardi poured over the top. A house top secret recipe that is the perfect final compliment to your meal experience at Gastromaquia. And if you don't speak spanish never fear the staff happily take their time to explain eveything on the menu, whether it be in english or spanish. This is a restaurant that values customer service and experience.  Thank you for a lovely evening in your unique restaurant!

The restaurant is downstairs in a hotel, towards the rear and away from the front windows, behind the bar area. Unfortunately, this means it feels like the basement it is, and the white decor doesn't make up for it. Service is shared with the bar area, but it was very good (I did come at a quiet time at 20:30 on a Wednesday).  The menu had four meat dishes, four fish dishes, shared plates, and some less expensive pasta and vegetarian entrées. Five different wines were available by the glass. Service was prompt and attentive. My tuna tataki was well prepared, and the waiter's recommendation for dessert and orujo was also good. I didn't think the meal was particularly expensive either. So while the food and service were quite good, I just came away disappointed by the sterile decor, lack of ambiance, Muzak, and limited menu.

Only problem was when we got there, they were closed for vacation. With no other plans, we came across La Portuguesa Taberna, which was in the same neighborhood as where we were staying. Based on previous reviews, we decided to check it out. Me (in very poor, Spanglish): ""my mom is a vegetarian, do you have any vegetarian dishes on your menu?"" Them: ""???"" Not exactly sure what they said but the gist of it was ""sure, of course"". They proceeded to make her a delicious rice and mushroom dish (not on the menu) and I got a dish that the owner recommended (didn't catch the name) which was bacalao (salt cod) with potatoes, onions and egg, along with a fabulous Portuguese red table wine.

Luckily it was around dinner time and luckily we found Alabaster via the Michelin guide! The service was impeccable, they were very conscious and understanding of our time constraint and the food was prepared extremely quickly. But that did not deter from the A-class meal this restaurant quite obviously consistently provides. We chose to share dishes and they very kindly prepared them on separate plates which was a nice, very “fine dining” touch. The tomato salad was incredibly fresh and the combination of flavours was very special - clean and crisp. The prawn that came with the egg and potato was quite simply spectacular on its own, but even better when eaten with its accompaniments. A true example of when a restaurant uses top quality ingredients. The slow cooked Galician rib of beef was a true delight and we had rarely had such a nice combination with the fresh herbs. Finally, the house dessert of lemon, the most heavenly meringue, and almond was absolutely DIVINE. We were so incredibly pleased to have stumbled upon this gastronomic delight in Madrid!!!

The food was not prepared with any care and more catered to the western palette. To start we ordered fermented vegatables and we got raw cabbage with a splash of vinegar they argued that it was fermentented and never offered to exchange or anything. The spicy beef with chili was missing the chilies to save the cost of adding ingredients. The meat was cut into huge chunks and not bite size to save time very gross. I travel a lot to China so I know how real Chinese food tastes like in Chengdu. The beef was burnt and seemed to be recycled recooked or something and did not represent the picture that shows the meat is tenderized and minced we got big dry chunks, again really bad and rude service when I told them I did not order this. We left the whole meat plate untouched. I ordered Dan Dan noodles that were made from a spaghetti pasta... just awful. I know they can cook authentic style but refuse to do it for western customers since most of us can't tell the difference. I asked them if they prepared Chengdu style dishes and the waiter said it takes too long. It's about making fast quick dishes with the minimum amount of ingredients to maximize $$$.

This venue was convenient to our hotel, and as many of the customers were Chinese it seemed like a good recommendation. We got a table and menus without a problem, but the noise built up quickly and made the visit unpleasant. The manager was shouting at staff and running up and down the restaurant and food wasn't coming out very quickly. We ordered a crispy spicy beef and prawns in oyster sauce. The rice came quickly. The prawns a bit later, and then the spicy beef. We were warned the beef was very spicy when it was served. It was so spicy that it wasn't edible - and I'm not averse to a spice or two. It looked very good, but sadly we had to send it back. There was no attempt to replace it, and although we'd have been happy to pay for it having ordered it, we weren't charged for it.

Firstly it is authentic; you can even see the Italian cooks in the kitchen preparing the food. Secondly it is really good value; with the menu del dia (availabe during the week) at 8.90e (+2e with a dessert), or a good sized pizza from 5.50e. I have been back a couple of times and the menu del dia changes so you get to try a variety of different dishes if you decide to go back. The menu del dia always has 2 options for starters and 2 for the main course, but the general menu with the pizzas always stays the same. The service is good but it is a popular place so I'd advise booking for the evening or getting there promptly for lunch. The one negative is that is is situated in the Mercado Anton Martin, literally in passageway between stalls so you will have people walking by constantly and the majority of the seating is on high stools - but the food more than makes up for it.",2017-03-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6736921-Reviews-or10-Fiaschetteria_La_Saletta-Madrid.html,UID_10024,0.024,0.886,0.09,0.8685,0.2638333333333333,0.4040833333333333,0.6899666666666665,1001,102,0.1018981018981019,0,22,False,42,0.0789473684210526,0.1842105263157894,0.2894736842105263,0.0789473684210526,0.2631578947368421,0.0,0.0263157894736842,0.0,0.0526315789473684,0.0263157894736842,195,119,4.138461538461539,0,0,fair italian restaur capit best one number reason firstli authent even see italian cook kitchen prepar food secondli realli good valu menu del dia availab week e e dessert good size pizza e back coupl time menu del dia chang get tri varieti differ dish decid go back menu del dia alway option starter main cours gener menu pizza alway stay servic good popular place advis book even get promptli lunch one neg situat mercado anton martin liter passageway stall peopl walk constantli major seat high stool food make,good review,4

We arrived around 8:45 and there was nobody seated in the restaurant. I say this because when we left around 9:45 it was jammed full with a queue out the door ! Many restaurants in Spain don't even open until 8:30, they like to eat late in Madrid. They were very busy with takeaway trade. We both ordered pizza and shared a salad. They have two sizes of pizza which is good. Speaking no Spanish they were able to give us an older menu in English so we could figure out what we wanted on the current Spanish menu. They added and took off things from the pizzas we wanted. Both were tasty. A large pizza, a smaller pizza, a lovely salad with a water and two large beers amounted to €37. Very tasty food. Service was efficient and they tried their best to accommodate us and our lack of Spanish. I would definitely eat here again.

It was an authentic, scrumptious porchetta made by the two owners of the stand. The real deal, as they say.  So the next day, I went back for more, dragging my Italian boyfriend with me just to double check the quality.  We had Spaghetti alla Chitarra with duck ragu', pizza with buffalo mozzarella and more porchetta. All the above were made to order, extremely good (ok, the pizza could have hosted more mozzarella, but we totally understand) and true to their roots. The wine selection was particularly laudable. The two Italian men running the place were friendly, efficient and professional, chatting with the customers but not too invasive, leaving us space to eat but always there if we needed anything.

For once, eating at Amicis one late Saturday evening in November, I could see there might be some Latin root connection there.  For sure, the food is good - it has to be, it's Madrid and competition is expansive, loud and broad - and around the shiny Mercado de San Miguel the standard bodegas and tabernas are dolled up even more to attract the tourist dollar. Amicis sits between the Mercado (fun for a drink and some finger food before the main event) and Flamenco Las Carboneras (go for the incredible dancing and don't be put off by the tourist crowd), and if it wasn't for recommendations from friends at home, we might have passed by the front door for a shinier, more obvious establishment. But boy, were we glad we didn't. As I said, the food was good. The ubiquitous patatas bravas were the best we ate in the city, the padron peppers perfectly charred, and our carnivorous Dutch friends assured us the duck pancakes were delicious. Many more tapas plates came and went, with the kitchen attentive to our mixed dietary requirements and changing things up so my girlfriend and I could try things, and the waiting staff always happy with suggestions and modifications. We paused while we regained some composure, drank some more of the well recommended house red, and then got down to the mains. I ordered an Asian salad, and it was fine but I think I just wanted more tapas. My girlfriend's burrata starter as a main was a success, and the Dutchies made short work of the on-point, medium rare wasabi fillet steak. A nod to the management for allowing their international team to stamp the mark of their respective homelands on the food and signature cocktails; fusion is nothing new but I always like to see further east and Southern American influence on European classics and here it really made things stand out. More cocktails, a sharing platter of sugary things to give us some spark back, plus a traditional digestif, and we were about ready to stride out into the night again. But this wasn't even the half of it. Yes, Amicis is about food. And drink. But it's mainly about being with friends, having fun, and not letting the business of transacting with a restaurant get in the way of that. In fact, Amicis makes it their business to enhance that friendly experience, as the name suggests. Fabio, the owner/manager was attentive all night, from welcome, to tour of the building, through business advice to my entrepreneur girlfriend, on hand but not crowding, to final drinks on the house and being sent on our way with a VIP pass to the front of the queue for the media darling club around the corner. Perhaps my head the next day was the 'Portuguese tapas' slap around the face, but in the company of Fabio and his excellent, warm and welcoming team, it was just handshakes, hugs and slaps on the back.  I understand why friends back in the UK recommended Amicis in a city of superlative dining experiences, and now I will too. The food is good. The price point is fair for the area. If you want Michelin star or to stretch your euro to the last cent, then you should look elsewhere. But if you want to dine with friends, laugh, and leave as one of the family, Amicis will puts its arm around you, fill you with good cheer, and send you smiling and feeling at home out under the Madrid moon sky.",2019-12-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12880799-Reviews-or20-Amicis-Madrid.html,UID_10083,0.002,0.771,0.228,0.9995,0.3002056858911698,0.446242668621701,0.3471833333333333,3465,298,0.086002886002886,0,91,False,96,0.1151079136690647,0.1798561151079136,0.2949640287769784,0.0719424460431654,0.2014388489208633,0.0215827338129496,0.014388489208633,0.014388489208633,0.0647482014388489,0.0215827338129496,621,359,4.578099838969404,0,0,brazilian girlfriend never tire tell sit tortilla croqueta tapa portugues slap around chop eat amici one late saturday even novemb could see might latin root connect sure food good madrid competit expans loud broad around shini mercado de san miguel standard bodega taberna doll even attract tourist dollar amici sit mercado fun drink finger food main event flamenco la carbonera go incred danc put tourist crowd recommend friend home might pass front door shinier obviou establish boy glad said food good ubiquit patata brava best ate citi padron pepper perfectli char carnivor dutch friend assur us duck pancak delici mani tapa plate came went kitchen attent mix dietari requir chang thing girlfriend could tri thing wait staff alway happi suggest modif paus regain composur drank well recommend hous red got main order asian salad fine think want tapa girlfriend burrata starter main success dutchi made short work point medium rare wasabi fillet steak nod manag allow intern team stamp mark respect homeland food signatur cocktail fusion noth new alway like see east southern american influenc european classic realli made thing stand cocktail share platter sugari thing give us spark back plu tradit digestif readi stride night even half ye amici food drink mainli friend fun let busi transact restaur get way fact amici make busi enhanc friendli experi name suggest fabio owner manag attent night welcom tour build busi advic entrepreneur girlfriend hand crowd final drink hous sent way vip pass front queue media darl club around corner perhap head next day portugues tapa slap around face compani fabio excel warm welcom team handshak hug slap back understand friend back uk recommend amici citi superl dine experi food good price point fair area want michelin star stretch euro last cent look elsewher want dine friend laugh leav one famili amici put arm around fill good cheer send smile feel home madrid moon sky,very good review,5

The octopus was a bit slimy, though the flavor was OK, but my wife's truffled pasta was missing the main ingredient, truffles! We called our server and explained the issue and they took the dish back. We were sitting right across from the kitchen and it looked like they were looking for the truffle oil, don't think they found it. Thd dish came back but really lacked thd truffle flavor that we expected. We did have a good bottle of rosé though!  The service was fine, staff was friendly and the place has a great vibe.

When the food arrived it looked amazing, and some of it was nice. However, pretty much all the dishes needed a bit of seasoning, which was disappointing. There doesn't seem to be a system for how the waiters work, i.e. sections or tables for certain waiters - two different people took our drinks and food orders, and two more came over to take our order after we'd already placed it.

We stared with the Crispy Eggplant with Honey, Rosi's Wings with Mango and Chili Sauce, Croquetas de jamón de ""La Rosi"", Baby Squid Bao and Calamari with Ali Oli. Every single tapa was extremely tasty. The we had the Paella de Marisco. We had been in Spain for 13 days and were looking for the best Paella and we finally found it at Rosi's!!! Creamy and tasty it cannot be missed. For dessert we had the Crazy Liquid Deconstructed Cheesecake and Caramelized Cinnamon Brioche with Ice Cream. YUM!!!

Every place we stopped at said they were fully booked despite the restaurants being more than 80% empty. Then we turn the corner and found Alabaster.

Desserts of cafe pannacotta and chocolate, orange macaron were great and beautifully presented. There's a huge wine list covering all types and prices.

At this restaurant you will find perfect service and an excellent wine cellar. The maître is excellent at describing the menu and specials in both Spanish and English.

At this point we realized we were in for some serious dining! We followed with the Dover Sole en papillote, the pork rib. These might sound like old standards of a London club; solid staples. Wrong!

Service was attentive except at the end when we had to ask for the bill. The server did offer me a few options from the starters that could be made Vegetarian but did not offer to ask the chef if a vegetable plate could be made up.

The staff is attentive but take themselves too seriously. The food is nice, but not great. The cod chips and creme are interesting, but only for a couple of bites. The croquettes of mussels look great, but are too soft and remind me more of mushy pumpkin nuggets versus anything that come from the sea. The sweetbreads were good, but the grains they were served with were distracting and took away the ""sweet"". The porcini & liver lasagna was delicate, but the mushrooms overpowered the dish and made it unbalanced - I wished they would have incorporated an acid to balance the fat. However, the sardine starters and the razors clams, with two different types of green fish roe and onion, were fantastic. The prawns with eggs were also good. They have a nice wine selection at decent prices. Everything is presented well, and they have a nice selection of dessert and well brewed coffee and espresso. I would take exception to earlier comments on the pistachio soufflé with ice creme - it tasted more of peanut butter and jelly with the bitter skins of pistachio than and any other pistachio dish (savory or sweet) that I have ever had.

Larceny maybe. Or theft of under $100.  Then came the grilled pork on a baked mashed potato with spinach in a wine sauce. Oh my. Maybe one of the single best meals I have had in the last year. Tender doesn’t begin to describe the texture of the meat. Grossly insufficient of a compliment. Buttery and velvety would be a start. All topped off with a fresh crusty whole wheat bread to sop up the sauce. Foolishly I partook in dessert. Some kind of triple chocolate explosion that was creamy and delicate and, not unlike heroin, highly addictive. If there had been a second plate of that dessert on the table, I would have stabbed my boss’ hand with a rusty fork to prevent him from getting any of it. Oh and the wine was good too.  And of course the service was impeccable. Friendly, well informed, pleasant and attentive. Never had to ask to refill a single glass of water or wine.

We wandered towards Plaza Del Sol around lunchtime and an older gentleman gave us a flyer for Rosi La Loca which I took and we carried on. Upon inspection we realised that they were offering interesting things for lunch at a really good price so we marched back to Calle Cadiz. The staff were really nice, very welcoming, and we were given a nice table by the door amongst a lively mix of locals and tourists. Our food and drinks were served quickly and with a smile, and we left feeling that we'd found a gem.  If I'm honest I get quite anxious about restaurants when travelling; we've had our fair share of average/worse dining experiences over our years of travelling in Spain and I'm sure some of them have come from the fact that we're tourists with average language skills. So to find Rosi La Loca on our first ever stroll round Madrid made us feel like kings, and we remember it fondly. I should add that we enjoyed the Paella so much that we booked for dinner the next evening where we had the full sized version and it was glorious.

The level is consistently excellent, and they do try to innovate and bring new dishes as well. The place screams classy. Good decoration, ample tables, nice decoration, the atmosphere is well presented. Both Fran and Oscar, the maitres, are both professional and warm. The personnel is very attentive, and they make sure that you feel right at home. Pleasantries aside, you probably are interested in the food, right? Your biggest regret will be not having a stomach big enough to order multiple dishes. They are very accommodating in terms of preparing half portions, so that you can try as many dishes as possible, however. The menu is consistently adapted, as I said, but they do keep plenty of classics around. The sardine is something you should not miss under any circumstances, as is the ""merluza al pil pil"", a fairly traditional spanish dish which reaches to-die-for levels. Seefood is a sure bet here in any case, scallops, ""zamburiñas"", ""navajas"", they are all reliably impressive. All the tartars I have tried here were a worth investment, as well For main dishes, I think their fish is the most remarkable part. They usually have some fishes out of the menu, and I would recommend to follow their advice here and try them. From the the meat, steak tartar is a favourite of mine, as is the ""presa"" (pork loin? I think. I'm not sure, many dishes do not have an easy translation to english). Desserts are not the strongest part, although I had an apple pie last time that made me quite happy. All in all, don't miss this one.

Then we found Alabaster on TripAdvisor. That is a real gem !! We booked quite early for Spain 8.30pm but we have been very well welcomed.  From A to Z the service was great. 5 waiters for 12 tables makes is a very enjoyable experience.  Products are all fresh and the cuisine is from Galicia. We have been very well advised by our waiter and dine from seafood to shellfish and Atlantic fish. All very good.  For the wine, the sommelier recommended a local cépage from Galicia (Albariño) which an excellent pairing.  And for the finish we have been offered a glass of Moscatel with the dessert.  Chapeau !

The chef's creativity, combined with the Sommelier's wine selections, were superlative! The sea anemone risotto was an imaginative tour de force! The very knowledgeable and charming Sommelier paired it with a wonderful wine from Mallorca, Golos, that made the perfect combination! The lemon dessert--it is pie and ice cream and merengue, all in one, was paired with a wonderful St. Croix du Mont, just beside the Sauterne region and tasting remarkably similar! But also, don't miss the Chocolate Texture dessert! The staff was friendly, attentive, detail oriented and very hard working. Kudos to the Alabaster Team, its leadership and its energy! Next time I return to Madrid, I won't fail to come back! My only negative for the evening was the lighting, it can be a bit overpowering, with all the whites, greys and slate. So I would try to dim them, but if you're a foodie and wine connoisseur, don't miss this restaurant! Their lunch, even in the bar area, is equally good!
