Christian and Francisco looked after us from beginning to end. Between the 6 of us we ate almost everything on the menu and loved it all! The location, the price and service are exceptional in this restaurant. My only reservation is that we were recommended their sister restaurant, being told it had a different, more traditional menu. After the great experience, we booked that night for dinner. We found more or less the same menu with substandard service. Stick to Brutal Bar to get a great all round experience.

We had hoped to eat at Rosi La Loca but it was full and Inclan is owned by the same people. We were a little unsure whether to go at first, but my goodness, how glad we were that we did! Our table was a high table with stools in the bar area as the restaurant was full. It was fun being sat there as we got to talk to most of the waiters/waitresses. The staff are all so friendly and helpful, they make you feel very welcome.  We chose 7/8 dishes between 3 of us. This was plenty though I would have loved to have tried more as everything on the menu sounds so appetising. The stand out dishes for us were the Bao Brutal con Carne, Bavette de Ternera and Cajon de Esto No Es Tomate. Everything was absolutely delicious. We also had several mini cocktails and shared a couple of desserts. The desserts were tasty but not as interesting and exciting as the tapas and cocktails were.  This restaurant is very reasonably priced and cost less than €100 for 8/9 dishes, 2 desserts, mini cocktails, beers and a €10 tip.

And the drink they gave was very tasty as well. We proceed to the next two tapas tour bars, but neither were nearly as good as the Inclan Brutal Bar. After the tour, after a few hours had passed, my wife and I decide that when it was time to eat again that we would head back to the Brutal Bar to try other things on their menu. We sat down at a bench type table near the bar, where we had a great view of the kitchen, and we got to watch the bartenders work their magic. We ordered some food, and over time got to know the two bartenders very well — Ruben and Guillermo. Both guys were awesome to talk to, and Ruben is the most impressive mixologist I’ve ever seen. He apparently was the one who created all the drinks, and my wife and I tried quite a few, and we didn’t find one that we didn’t love.   The food was amazing as well. We even told some other people who we met the next day about Brutal Bar, and they ended up telling us they loved it as well. They thanked us for recommending it to them. So if that doesn’t tell you how good this place is, I don’t know what else I can tell you that would convince you. All I can say is that we loved the food, we loved the drinks, and were lucky enough to meet Ruben and Guillermo. It was a great night, and I think it’s a great place to go for some food and drinks.",2018-07-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10358028-Reviews-or600-Inclan_Brutal_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_18033,0.056,0.714,0.23,0.997,0.2093650793650793,0.5687301587301588,0.38925,1444,152,0.1052631578947368,0,30,False,76,0.15,0.2,0.35,0.075,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.0,295,159,3.8915254237288135,0,0,wife tapa tour inclan brutal bar first stop tapa gave us tasti fresh drink gave tasti well proceed next two tapa tour bar neither nearli good inclan brutal bar tour hour pass wife decid time eat would head back brutal bar tri thing menu sat bench type tabl near bar great view kitchen got watch bartend work magic order food time got know two bartend well ruben guillermo guy awesom talk ruben impress mixologist ever seen appar one creat drink wife tri quit find one love food amaz well even told peopl met next day brutal bar end tell us love well thank us recommend tell good place know els tell would convinc say love food love drink lucki enough meet ruben guillermo great night think great place go food drink,very good review,5

It is rather rough, but the chairs are nice, and you sit comfortable in them. Even if they have a long drink list it is mostly a restaurant and at our visit it was just dinner guest that we saw.  Most of the starters you could have a small or a large portion. If you want a starter our advice is to pick the small ones, we did and was quite OK with their size. My wife started with a gazpacho that she liked very much. I picked the mysteries box with anything but tomatoes. And it was not. It looked as it was gold painted tomatoes in a tomato sauce. Actually, it was cheese in a sweet sauce. Just delicious. As a main course we picked tuna. It was very nicely served on a boat shaped plate on a wooden bout with shells. It is a could dish. The tuna was perfectly fried and on a small bed of very tasty greens and some dots with a very tasty sauce. You ned the bread with it, but then it was just excellent with a glass of the good Alberino wine. As a desert I picked the crusted chocolate cake and violet ice-cream, this was good but not up to the very high standard of the starters and main courses. This was really a delicious meal with a twist we really appreciated.

The food was delicious and the presentation was extraordinary. One of the dishes we ordered (can't remember the name), came with two slices of ham handing from a horizontal bar and two pieces of small pies with apple sauce under them. The waitress them came with a blow torch and smoked the ham in front of us. it served 2 purposes: 1) smoked the ham, 2) flavored the pie under the ham with the drippings of fat from ham. The location of this place is very close to Plaza Saint Ana. Though it's not a massive place, probably less than 50 people can sit there at the same time, the food and the service is very impressive.

Fortunately, La Mi Venta was open all day and accommodated us.

He showed us to a table downstairs in the cave-like main dining room, which was cozy and well-decorated. He took care to recommend their best dishes along with the best pairing wines. We enjoyed beef, pork and paella, all of which was outstanding. The pork may have been the best I have ever eaten.

Monday evening, our last night in Madrid on a belated honeymoon. The place was empty (bad sign) but we were greeted warmly (good sign). Menu is very small which is a good sign in my book, but most gringos seem to like the Cheesecake Factory/Claim Jumpers 500 item menu. Well, we started with the largest tapas sampler, which was all cured meats and a bit of cheese. These were the best cured meats I've ever tasted (and living in Chicago, I've tasted a lot of cured meat). The Iberian pork steak and beef steak were a bit  fatty, but just delicious. The house wine was a steal, and the desserts were so good, they were gone in literally less than 90 seconds. They finished us off with the Spanish versions of limoncello and bailey's . The feast came in at 90 euros. I would not blink at giving this place a top recommendation.

Weren't sure what to expect from a Flamenco show, we really thought the ladies would have dresses with long, ruffled trains, and they did not...... there was a lot of stomping and clapping. This was the one and only Flamenco show we ever saw, so we have nothing to compare it to.... just so you know what you are in for. We went to Seville after Madrid and they said Flamenco is really from there so maybe it's more authentic in feeling there? We didn't want to go again so we don't know for sure.

Helena went above and beyond to find a place for us at the bar and surprisingly enough after a few minutes was able to find a table for us. We were extremely grateful, as that was our last day in Madrid and we really wanted to check the place out. On top of that, the service was amazingly fast and our waiter, Patti, was very diligent. The food was also very tasty and exceeded my expectations. I honestly have to say that I was very impressed by the personnel's commitment to their job and to the costumers, especially Helena who, in light of having a full restaurant, essentially did the impossible so that we could experience the bar.

Our hosts at La Mi Venta were unfazed and quickly settled us into an outdoors table and had the cold drinks in front of us with unfeasible speed. Our dining experience was great. The Iberico jamon in particular was very good - and we were told proudly that it had been prepared by Spain's ""second best"" ham carver! Certainly looked good to me. The great food kept coming in sizable portions and it was all helped down by the unexpected arrival of Spanish digestifs (Pacharan and Orujo de Hierbas). The wine list offers great value - not least in the shape of the marvellous Muge Rioja Gran Riserva that we were told is the favourite tipple of the King (whose palace was visible, beautifully floodlit, just across the road).  Service throughout was friendly and charming. I have never seen crumbs swept from a table with a more theatrical flourish. This was the first night of a short weekend break in Madrid for us, and it succeeded in setting a very high standard for the rest of the holiday. I would certainly recommend La Mi Venta to anyone wanting to eat well-prepared food in a buzzy and authentic ambience - or sitting outside toasting the King in front of The Royal Palace.",2015-06-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or810-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_18110,0.007,0.784,0.209,0.9944,0.2997101894521249,0.5066262160778291,0.33223,1230,100,0.08130081300813,1,25,False,38,0.16,0.16,0.28,0.08,0.16,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.1,0.04,222,148,4.54054054054054,0,0,arriv bit late due delay flight host la mi venta unfaz quickli settl us outdoor tabl cold drink front us unfeas speed dine experi great iberico jamon particular good told proudli prepar spain second best ham carver certainli look good great food kept come sizabl portion help unexpect arriv spanish digestif pacharan orujo de hierba wine list offer great valu least shape marvel muge rioja gran riserva told favourit tippl king whose palac visibl beauti floodlit across road servic throughout friendli charm never seen crumb swept tabl theatric flourish first night short weekend break madrid us succeed set high standard rest holiday would certainli recommend la mi venta anyon want eat well prepar food buzzi authent ambienc sit outsid toast king front royal palac,very good review,5

I randomly chose La Mi Venta and I'm so thankful that I did. We got there around 10-1030pm and although we had known that restaurants stay open very late in Madrid, still asked on arrival if they were still serving - which of course they were! We were seated and treated like royalty by our waiter, David. We weren't sure what to order and wanted to try a few things so David made it possible for us by making sure we didn't order to much by halving some of the portions that we ordered and making some fabulous recommendations! We started with a small portion of spanish omelette, which was amazing. I think I had only tried this dish once before and this was totally out of this world! Afterward we were presented with a spectacular plate of jamon iberico, all different sorts and two types of cheeses. David explained all the different types to us and also advised us that we were eating an award winning cheese as well! This was delicious and David was continuously topping up our bread so that we could devour the lot of the exceptionally delicate and delicious jamon! After leisurely eating this plate, we were given our goats cheese salad which David had halved as well due to the portion size being too large for the meal we had intended to eat - the cheese was mouth-watering, the salad extremely fresh and every bite a bit of heaven! As we were keen to have the best culinary experience possible so we had ordered a main to share amongst the two of us of a presa ham, which David had recommended to be the best in Spain. If I hadn't been told it was ham, I would have had no idea - the meat was extremely succulent and perfectly cooked, along side this came grilled small green peppers and thinly sliced potatoes with caramelized onions and red peppers. Fabulous! While finishing our beer and sangria and chit chatting about Madrid, what we wanted to do and relishing over our lovely meal, we ordered a wafer and baked cream cheese dessert (how we had any room left over, I'm not sure but there was no possible way we could have left without having tried a dessert) with fruit coulis which came to us after a good few minutes, giving us a chance to relax and digest with a sweet birthday message and a candle, which I thought was very kind and made the occasion and dinner even more special!  Richard and I both agreed that the food was exceptional but that the service was what made the experience and we will be back to this restaurant the next time we go to Madrid and to be perfectly honest, I can't stop talking about it and the waiter David's service since we got home! I would have no problem recommending this to anyone going to Madrid! By far one of the best meals I have had in my 30 years!

David, in particular, was very attentive and took the time to explain things and make good recommendations. He was clearly very proud of their products (especially the ham and wine) and it was clear that his goal was to help us having a high quality and memorable dining experience.  The food was quite nice: tomatoes in olive oil and herbs, jamón ibérico, and a bottle of Rioja to start and the Presa and cabra dishes to share as main dishes... all added up to containment.

We were seated in the least attractive basement room, which was puzzling, but I am pretty sure it is because all the English speakers were clustered with the waiter who can speak English. Very charming individual, English not bad, and probably jaded from serving too many tourists. We had the sampler tapas because we did not know what to order. Some excellent items, some not so excellent items. Dumb on our part. Also ordered the gras/pate, which was outstanding, and the grilled squid, which was also exceptional. House wine was okay. They do have a more extensive wine list, but our jet-lagged and addled brains were not ready to split a bottle.

Enjoyed the wine, some grilled vegetables. He steered toward the presso which was tasty but I think he oversold it. Definitely a little too fatty for me. I would have left a nice tip, but when the check came, I found they added a charge for a couple of pieces of bread and olive oil that they automatically give you when you are seated(about 4 euros). Also if you want water which of course they offer, they don't tell you or give you an option that they are serving you bottled water. Madrid has perhaps the best city drinking water in Spain, so I would have opted, had I known, for city water. Instead we also got stuck with a few euro charge for the water as well. I can't really complain, because before they give you the check, they comp you a little after dinner liqueur. Do recommend for ambience and service.

Very knowledgable of their menu. Very polite, and attentive. After dinner, he asked us how was dinner, and my wife simply said it was a bit undercooked for her taste, immediately he offered another plate.  After dinner we were politely escorted to the next room where performance was going to be. They sat us at an excellent table and Alberto again was very attentive throughout the whole evening. As far as the performance goes, I don't think words could describe it. There were moments that I felt my heart skip a beat, then there were moments I ghasped for air and then there many moments I felt the hair raise all over my body. Not to mention at points I thought smoke is going to rise from their steps.

Taberna Mas Al Sur is quite small, perhaps 6 -- 8 tables, plus a counter at the bar and behind the bar. When we turned up, the tiny space was packed to the rafters with humanity. Despite a booking, on being time, we were told we'd have to wait. That's high up the list of things that Grind My Gears at restaurants. So we ordered cocktails at the bar, standing, and waited for the cows to come home for them to be made. It wasn't like the staff were lazy, they were working their posteriors off! It was just too small a place to handle the number of people in there. The cocktails were, though, pretty good. Perhaps about half an hour to 45 minutes after our booking time, we were offered to share a table with another couple that had also been waiting for a while. Sharing tables after booking is also high on the list of things that Grinds My Gears. So we were seated and ordered. After another while the food came out but they missed a dish for our oder (I think it went to another table that sent it back!!). The food was rich, tasty, and as other reviewers say, generous, so we didn't insist on the missing dish. But of course were were charged for it (but they happily reversed the charges). At another memorable point someone dropped a napkin that had lit on fire. They quickly alerted the staff who asked ""would you like another napkin"", before the patron pointed out that it really was on fire, on the ground, and the waiter proceeded to do a bit of a latin dance number on it to put it out... all in a day's work around the Mas Al Sur I'd say! So I left with some damaged hearing, a long wait despite booking, shared table, missed dish (but still full stomach), the excitement of the flaming napkin, and a free shot of something Bailey's like at the end.

But I'm happy to report our experience was even better than we expected and a highlight of our trip to Spain. First off, we were expecting something crowded, chaotic, and challenging for a first time visitor to Spain. It was anything but that. This venue is extremely well run and they know how to treat visitors, both locals and foreigners. We arrived early before the restaurant opened at 6pm for our 6:30pm reservation, but were invited in by the manager to sit in the lobby. The lobby is filled with dozens of photographs of famous people who visited CDLM to include Samuel L. Jackson, Mariah Carey, Boris Karloff, Lana Turner, etc. While we were sitting there, the staff came in and conducted a pre-opening business meeting around us and we observed first hand how organized and friendly they are. The staff is young, and they speak English fairly well.  CDLM seats around 100 people and only maybe 3 seats are behind a column which would require you to move a bit (those seats are filled last). Dinner reservations are on the half hour starting at 6:30pm, and it's great to find a Madrid restaurant open that early. The shows are at 8:30pm and 10:20pm, so if you get a 7:00pm or 7:30pm reservation, you'll have no problem getting a good table. The food is excellent, comparable to a high end restaurant. I had steak medallions and my wife had salmon, both were delicious. We had sangria for drinks, probably the best we had in Spain. Total cost for drinks entrees, desserts, and the show ended up being $230 for the two of us, well worth it. The flamenco show lasts for one hour and is spirited, professional, and high quality. At the table they provide the equivalent of a playbill, listing who the performers are and their qualifications. The show consists of four dancers, two guitar players, a percussionist, and three male singers. We were impressed by the show as was everyone there.  CDLM is easy to find, just south of the Royal Place off Calle Bailin and no more than a 10 minute walk from two different metro stations. Their website to make reservations is in English and is easy to understand and use at www.corraldelamoreria.com.",2014-06-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or250-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_18220,0.02,0.804,0.176,0.9974,0.2870731707317073,0.5653658536585366,0.3881761904761904,2319,185,0.0797757654161276,0,67,False,72,0.1475409836065573,0.1475409836065573,0.2622950819672131,0.0655737704918032,0.2131147540983606,0.0327868852459016,0.0163934426229508,0.0327868852459016,0.0491803278688524,0.0327868852459016,410,258,4.6536585365853655,0,0,went corral de la moreria cdlm base recommend patricia schultz place see die well base review read happi report experi even better expect highlight trip spain first expect someth crowd chaotic challeng first time visitor spain anyth venu extrem well run know treat visitor local foreign arriv earli restaur open pm pm reserv invit manag sit lobbi lobbi fill dozen photograph famou peopl visit cdlm includ samuel l jackson mariah carey bori karloff lana turner etc sit staff came conduct pre open busi meet around us observ first hand organ friendli staff young speak english fairli well cdlm seat around peopl mayb seat behind column would requir move bit seat fill last dinner reserv half hour start pm great find madrid restaur open earli show pm pm get pm pm reserv problem get good tabl food excel compar high end restaur steak medallion wife salmon delici sangria drink probabl best spain total cost drink entre dessert show end two us well worth flamenco show last one hour spirit profession high qualiti tabl provid equival playbil list perform qualif show consist four dancer two guitar player percussionist three male singer impress show everyon cdlm easi find south royal place call bailin minut walk two differ metro station websit make reserv english easi understand use www corraldelamoreria com,very good review,5

Juan이 온더하우스로 제공해준 꽈리고추와 곁들여 먹으니 그 맛이 잘 어울렸습니다. 식사가 끝나고 다시 한번 식당으로부터 제공받은 꼬냑은 깔끔하게 식사를 마무리 하도록 해주었습니다. 마드리드에서 스페인식 식사를 하며 잊지 못할 기억을 남기고 싶으시다면 꼭 이곳에서 식사해보시길 추천드립니다.  It was a great place to visit and have a satisfying meal with three of my friends.   I can either eat inside and outside the restaurant. I got to see a remarkable sunset as I sat outside.  The food we ordered was Paella, Jamon, and steak. Mr. Juan had recommended steak and Jamon as the house's specialty. Jaemon's flavor gradually grew every time I chewed and it went so perfect with a glass of sangria. Paella comes with a great variety of seafoods, and it was spectacular, and the steaks are cooked just right that its juice come out every time you chew. The side dish and from the house Juan was accompanied by chopped red pepper served to Onder House and it tasted good. Once the meal was over, the cognac, once again served from the restaurant, helped to finish the meal neatly.  If you want to have a Spanish meal in Madrid and you want to make an unforgettable memory, we recommend you to dine here. And thank you Mr. Juan for helping me and my friend have a wonderful first night at Madrid.",2019-07-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or180-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_18224,0.0,0.859,0.141,0.992,0.499047619047619,0.5812698412698414,0.2238399999999999,1515,89,0.0587458745874587,0,37,False,50,0.1764705882352941,0.1764705882352941,0.3235294117647059,0.1176470588235294,0.2058823529411764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,300,227,4.03,0,0,mr juan juan great place visit satisfi meal three friend either eat insid outsid restaur got see remark sunset sat outsid food order paella jamon steak mr juan recommend steak jamon hous specialti jaemon flavor gradual grew everi time chew went perfect glass sangria paella come great varieti seafood spectacular steak cook right juic come everi time chew side dish hous juan accompani chop red pepper serv onder hous tast good meal cognac serv restaur help finish meal neatli want spanish meal madrid want make unforgett memori recommend dine thank mr juan help friend wonder first night madrid,average review,3

We order ""Secreto Iberico"" the chicken, the veal , the 5 chocolates, creme brule, the Goat cheese salad, The Jamon Iberico the Childhood memories, and all, I mean every meal was excellent.. The meal started as soon as we arrive like a quarter to 8 pm then the show started at 9 until 10:15 or so. I am not a person who knows about flamenco, but if it not the best is one of the best. WE all enjoyed. My son (7 years) could not stop watching the show. Reserve in advance online and it is worth to make a phone call to get a table not too far from the show. We went there on Valentine and it was packed but amazingly the service was fast, very polite and they are professionals of the business. When you check the menu online, you will be a ble to see pictures of every meal so you can choose in advance before getting there, it is worth it. You will find the prices high but believe me it is worth it. WE were four and with all and taxes it was 260 in total plus the show which you pay online in advance.

Our food was excellent, the service was excellent and the flamenco show was great. This is an historical sight in Madrid. I saw flamenco here 40 years ago when the great Lucero Tena was still dancing. Little has changed at the restaurant and it is worth the visit today. I would say that the food has gotten better. We usually go with one of the set meals, but you can substitute the salad from one and the entree from another. I had the Goat cheese salad and the steak with the 5 chocolate dessert. Highly recommended. One of our group also had the salmon and was very happy with it. Cost is around 50 Euros each, but the show is included so I think its a great value. It is crowded and intimate, but also very warm and inviting. I would avoid the table right up against the stage, as the dancing can be loud and the swinging dresses knocked over some drinks while we were there last night. All part of the adventure. There were four of us and we were one table off from the stage. Perfect seats and a delightful experience.

If you eat dinner in the small adjacent restaurant beforehand, you get a front-row table for the show afterwards. Although this is an expensive outing (tickets for just the show are about $50 and the dinner is not cheap -- I seem to recall that this is one of the few places where the VAT was not included in the menu price), it was a memorable experience. The food was also top-notch -- Spanish haute-cuisine and a nice break from the usual tapas. The show was so interesting, it actually led to our visiting a flamenco museum in Cordoba later in the trip.  Tip: Go to the late show if you can. I had read in reviews and also heard from a colleague that the late show is generally more energized and authentic.

On one hand, the place is great in the terms of experiencing quality flamenco. True world class performers in a traditional, rustic setting. HOWEVER, it all depends on where one sits in terms of location and neighbors. After buying tickets online several months ahead and traveling all the way from Singapore, we were unlucky enough to be seated in the way back corner, and next to a very, very loud and obnoxious two related family tables. It's really puzzling why they let young children into a place like this. It's even more puzzling how parents just let their kids be in what is suppose to be an intimate setting. They ruined it for us and all the tables around as well. To add insult to injury, the floor staff did nothing about it (in addition to forgetting our simple drink order 3 times!) I picked up the contact of the head staff member and will be lodging a formal complaint.  Bottom Line: May be worth a visit but look around for other options first. Else, pay top dollar but just hope you get a good seat and sit next to polite people.

We were seated up front near the bar. There’s a high energy level. We had risotto, which was good. We also had a bottle of wine and a bottle of water.

The paella was the best of 4 paella so we had in the week in Spain. I would have easily rated this place a 5 star if not for that 8 out of 10 clams in the paella was not opened and hence by my understanding not cooked. But the waiter tried to explain it away by saying that the clams opened during cooking, the flavors extracted and they closed tight again once removed from stove. I think this was an unnecessary silly cop out as we enjoyed the dish nevertheless. He could have taken cared of that it other ways and we would have been happy. I took one star off for that. The pintos were delicious although be careful if you order that the portion is large and can easily fill you before your main course.  We had thought they had suckling pig on their menu but they don't. Instead We ordered their roasted goatling , supposed slow roasted in a traditional way. Our teenagers with discriminating palate loved it. My wife on the other hand did not like the ""gamey"" taste of the goat meat which was not covered by the very subtle flavor. The meat was very soft from the slow roasting. We sat in the basement that used to be used to hang hams to be cured. It was charming, quiet and so cooling from the summer heatwave.  The service and waiters were otherwise impeccable. The price is not for the budget conscious but reasonable for a nice , charming, comfortable restaurant.",2015-07-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or790-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_18259,0.008,0.801,0.19,0.9959,0.2648701298701299,0.6750793650793652,0.4465125,1484,145,0.0977088948787062,0,26,False,48,0.0952380952380952,0.1428571428571428,0.3571428571428571,0.0238095238095238,0.2142857142857142,0.0,0.0476190476190476,0.0238095238095238,0.0714285714285714,0.0238095238095238,276,171,4.3731884057971016,0,0,nice bit upscal place delici uniqu dish without exorbit price paella best paella week spain would easili rate place star clam paella open henc understand cook waiter tri explain away say clam open cook flavor extract close tight remov stove think unnecessari silli cop enjoy dish nevertheless could taken care way would happi took one star pinto delici although care order portion larg easili fill main cours thought suckl pig menu instead order roast goatl suppos slow roast tradit way teenag discrimin palat love wife hand like gamey tast goat meat cover subtl flavor meat soft slow roast sat basement use use hang ham cure charm quiet cool summer heatwav servic waiter otherwis impecc price budget consciou reason nice charm comfort restaur,very good review,5

During our stay in Madrid we all wanted to see a traditional Flamenco Dance Show. Everybody we spoke to said that the ""Corral de la Moreria"" had the best show. The food was also excellent which surprised us. Two of us (including myself) had Monk Fish for our main course, and we really enjoyed this amazing and tender fish. Our only complaint for the evening is that the courses are on the small side, and we had to eat most of our meal in the dark as the lights are turned off during the show. The Flamenco show was amazing and I highly recommend that you go see the show. For a complete meal with appetizers, drinks, and dessert, just be ready to shell out about $125.00 per person.

He refilled my hot water and lemon without me even asking and brought more bread when we ran out (we were hungry!).  He checked in to make sure all was good and stayed attentive unlike a lot of restaurants here where you have to nearly beat down a waiter to get their attention to bring the check.

Food: We ordered a Caesar salad, and half order of the prawns, risotto, stewed pork, and chicken curry. The Caesar, risotto, and prawns all came within minutes of each other, which was a little strange but it was fine. However the stewed pork and curry took a while which kind of took away from our dining experience. The Caesar was not bad, however the croutons were stale. The stewed pork, prawns, and risotto were all fine, while the chicken curry was rather plain.  Service: All of our servers were adequate/nice, but I’ve never felt more disrespected by our host/waiter. When we arrived st the restaurant, we walked in and he immediately halted us and told us to wait. No greeting, just a “HOLD ON.” Several minutes go by and he leads us to our table, and leaves the menus at the table before we have a chance to sit down.  When taking our order, he rushed us through our order, didn’t repeat when there was clearly a language barrier, and didn’t offer to clarify. He didn’t mess up our order, but we did have to repeat it several times because he seemed distracted.  The most disturbing part of our experience is the lack of attention we saw from him; and moreso the gross (literally) treatment of other patrons that were females. A nearby couple had the male go to the restroom, and our waiter immediately went up to talk to the young woman sitting by herself, obviously flirting with her and shaking her hand and getting far too close than any waiter ever should. We took it as a language barrier because they were speaking in Spanish, while we only spoke English.  Another table of three women he continually serviced and flirted with, was playful with, and very chatty with. Again three Spanish speakers, so we thought nothing of it.  As we were finishing up our meal, three other women come in who were also English speakers sat near us, and the male waiter once again seemed predatory in his approach to these women. Asking where are they from, being very playful and flirtatious. It was very disturbing to see this waiter be so flirtatious with women by themselves. This same waiter did not say anything to us our entire meal other than taking our order. Another more normal looking couple came in after us and received the same treatment we got; negligence.  Not talking to us because you’re busy is fine, but being an absolute creep, preying on other women is disgusting. It tainted our entire experience at this place, and honestly cannot recommend this place because of moreso how gross this waiter was. I don’t wish this kind of treatment on anyone.",2019-05-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396325-Reviews-or420-Taberna_Mas_Al_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_18299,0.087,0.821,0.092,0.5884,0.0186544011544011,0.4538672438672438,0.4556625,2681,230,0.0857888847444983,0,65,False,89,0.08,0.0666666666666666,0.2133333333333333,0.0666666666666666,0.08,0.0933333333333333,0.0666666666666666,0.0666666666666666,0.2533333333333333,0.0133333333333333,472,262,4.6673728813559325,0,0,girlfriend went shortli arriv madrid unfortun great experi food order caesar salad half order prawn risotto stew pork chicken curri caesar risotto prawn came within minut littl strang fine howev stew pork curri took kind took away dine experi caesar bad howev crouton stale stew pork prawn risotto fine chicken curri rather plain servic server adequ nice never felt disrespect host waiter arriv st restaur walk immedi halt us told us wait greet hold sever minut go lead us tabl leav menu tabl chanc sit take order rush us order repeat clearli languag barrier offer clarifi mess order repeat sever time seem distract disturb part experi lack attent saw moreso gross liter treatment patron femal nearbi coupl male go restroom waiter immedi went talk young woman sit obvious flirt shake hand get far close waiter ever took languag barrier speak spanish spoke english anoth tabl three women continu servic flirt play chatti three spanish speaker thought noth finish meal three women come also english speaker sat near us male waiter seem predatori approach women ask play flirtati disturb see waiter flirtati women waiter say anyth us entir meal take order anoth normal look coupl came us receiv treatment got neglig talk us busi fine absolut creep prey women disgust taint entir experi place honestli cannot recommend place moreso gross waiter wish kind treatment anyon,very bad review,1

We originally wanted to do just the show and a drink, but it was sold out for that option and we had to have dinner there to watch the show. I had read that the food wasn't great at the tableaus, so I was hesitant to book the dinner. We ended up doing it, and it turned out pretty well in the end. The show made it all worthwhile. On the downside, it is very expensive. They give you the option for a al carte or a prix faire menu. We tried to order the meals on the fixed price menu but they were out of two of the options we wanted (chicken and a veal dish). This was surprising since we were at the first seating for the show. They did allow us to substitute steak in for the the missing meals, and they turned out to be fine. However, our waiter was either new, or didn't understand english well, because he didn't know what we ordered and we had to repeat ourselves several times and point to the menu items to place our orders. Forget clarifying anything on the menu with him! Additionally, he brought our meals out late, and brought us food we didn't order on three of our meals. We couldn't identify what it was they brought us, and the show had started so it was not possible to really discuss it with him. It wouldn't have helped anyway. The good news is that we really liked whatever food they did give us.  I will say, that while the service and the mistakes were disappointing given the price we were paying, in the end it turned out fine. The show was wonderful and we really enjoyed it. It was truly unlike anything I had ever seen before and I am so glad we went.",2015-04-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or220-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_18326,0.068,0.796,0.136,0.98,0.2437878787878787,0.5919151515151514,0.4681166666666667,1608,179,0.111318407960199,3,41,False,54,0.08,0.14,0.22,0.06,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.06,0.08,313,166,4.137380191693291,0,0,love flamenco show origin want show drink sold option dinner watch show read food great tableau hesit book dinner end turn pretti well end show made worthwhil downsid expens give option al cart prix fair menu tri order meal fix price menu two option want chicken veal dish surpris sinc first seat show allow us substitut steak miss meal turn fine howev waiter either new understand english well know order repeat sever time point menu item place order forget clarifi anyth menu addit brought meal late brought us food order three meal identifi brought us show start possibl realli discuss help anyway good news realli like whatev food give us say servic mistak disappoint given price pay end turn fine show wonder realli enjoy truli unlik anyth ever seen glad went,average review,3

When we arrived we saw the tables are arranged very close to each other to the extent that it's difficult to even move the chair little bit to sit. Even the waiters seem to have difficulty moving around and serving. I found the dishes not so tasty and highly overpriced. A three course meal for 2 persons costed 140 Euro, whereas we ate a very delicious 3 course lunch same day at Thyssen Bornemisza museum café for 30 Euros. Now, coming to the Flamenco show. The Gitarists looked uninterested in the show and looked bored. One solo lady singer who sang some song was screaming so loud, it was difficult to tolerate her song and voice. The male and female dancers were good at the foot work and had lot of enthusiasm and interest. Overall, I think it is beneficial to avoid this place as one can neither enjoy the food nor the dance. It's very very overpriced. The total expenditure for dinner and dance show was approx 250 Euro.

The wait outside Corral de la Moreira for the 22:20 show was a bit long. Fortunately, there were few interesting people to chat up with while waiting. The service – this impressed me the most, and by this, I am referring to the waiters. The restaurant was full; with every person on every table asking for different varieties of dishes. They managed to deliver the right food to the right person, all promptly and with a pleasant service. The food – I have mixed feeling about it. I enjoyed the starter and salads but my main dish (sea bass in cream) didn't feel fresh. It was lukewarm, and not hot. It tasted strange. Another person in our group ordered the same dish and felt the same too. The dance – I was curious how they would dance about as the stage was pretty small (compared to Café de Chinitas, for example). But, this is where the magic began. The performers were good. They live in their dance. Their expressions and their passion made the show so thrilling. I particularly liked “El Junco”. He is so talented. The price of the show was reasonable, given that they are top class performers. The food was a bit over-priced.  I liked the experience but I am not particularly blown away.",2015-04-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991547-Reviews-or220-Corral_de_la_Moreria-Madrid.html,UID_18328,0.017,0.807,0.176,0.9923,0.2498051948051947,0.566975546975547,0.3911857142857143,1314,121,0.0920852359208523,0,39,False,43,0.144927536231884,0.1884057971014492,0.2608695652173913,0.072463768115942,0.217391304347826,0.0289855072463768,0.0144927536231884,0.0144927536231884,0.0434782608695652,0.0144927536231884,240,151,4.475,0,0,thing much talk place expect high easi go downhil wait outsid corral de la moreira show bit long fortun interest peopl chat wait servic impress refer waiter restaur full everi person everi tabl ask differ varieti dish manag deliv right food right person promptli pleasant servic food mix feel enjoy starter salad main dish sea bass cream feel fresh lukewarm hot tast strang anoth person group order dish felt danc curiou would danc stage pretti small compar caf de chinita exampl magic began perform good live danc express passion made show thrill particularli like el junco talent price show reason given top class perform food bit price like experi particularli blown away,average review,3

It was the first time I was in Spain and I had never eaten a paella at that time, so my girlfriend and I walked into that friendly-looking restaurant. The waiter was not only good, he was really passionate! I can quote him saying: ""If you really want the rice, I can give you the rice, but that's not what we are known for. Other places make better rice, but we are amongst the best in terms of meat."". And that's when we decided that we will eat Paella another day.

The ‘not tomatoes’ dish and the cigars ( trust me these can be eaten) we presented in their most unusual way. So did the sardines too.  Only one dish stood out in terms of flavour and it was the Iberian pork steak which was to die for. The others didn’t quite deliver on flavour as much for me but I loved how they were presented which were excellent for photos.  Different types of lemonade stood out as I don’t drink alcohol which always appeals me as there aren’t many places that offer good choices which are non alcoholic.

Our party of four selected starters to share,cold meat platter, which were top qualit ham and various salami.Main courses were iberian pressa, which was grilled to perfection, octopus and a foie burger which was not your normal tourist fare. All the food was well presented and cooked to perfection. Wine list was excellent and very reasonable,€17 for a great Spanish rose. Desserts are not to be missed, home made and unusual. Complementary drink at end of meal. The service was great throughout the meal, nothing was too much trouble, all explanations of the menu added to the experience. The cost for four, shared starters, bread, water, four exceptional mains, desserts, coffee, two bottles of wine €160, great value for a great experience.

We walked in, and were as far from disappointed as you can possibly be. My seafood paella was so fresh that my mussels shell had barnacles on it!  We started off with the fried eggplant and cranberry aioli, which my friend says was one of the best things she’s ever had.  We finished off with the Nutella cheesecake, and I honestly teared up on the first bite. Afterwards we relaxed and chatted with a cafe con leche, and the Morning Team brought us complimentary Crema De Roho, a crème liqueur made in Northern Spain.  Everything was beyond fantastic, and so, so fresh. A special and exceptional meal, experience, and memory. We are so grateful!

My husband and I ordered a Spanish omelette (tapa), belly (internal organ of a pig) in tomato sauce (tapa) and ham (half portion). The omelette was out of expectation. Don't even think to equate it with any of the tapas bar on the road. The belly was too good that the meat was tender and full of taste. Ham, as good as it should be. But it worth mentioning that they were not ""salty"". The fish, hake, was charcoal grilled. Simply, like it! We also had a bottle of Albariño. Personally, I think it is good to go with fatty ham and the belly.  A side dish, an insect went into my glass of wine and the waiter complimentary me with another white which was a bit more sour but more aromatic with essence of flower.

For a start, it's easy to find - just a up a side street around 100 metres from the front of the Royal Palace, or alternatively 5 minutes walk from Opera metro station. After sifting through Trip Advisor's restaurant reviews prior to our Madrid trip this place made it to our shortlist on the strength of good reviews but the fact that it also had some outside tables was an added attraction for us. They don't take reservations for the outside tables but when we arrived (around 8 pm - very early by Madrid standards) there was still plenty of room outside. We didn't get to see the inside (although I gather from other reviewers it's good) but sitting outside was very nice & I had a view of part of the palace over my dinner companion's shoulder. It made an attractive backdrop, particularly after it started to get dark & the palace lights came on. Our waiter was very pleasant & spoke good english which made life easier when it came to ordering. I went for pork, my friend opted for the steak & while we were waiting for it to be prepared, our waiter brought us bread, olives & some quality olive oil for dipping. For wine we shared a bottle of house red (a safe option in Madrid). All were excellent. This restaurant has a lot going for it - it's well located, food, wine & service are all very good & the prices are extremely reasonable.

This place is just 5m away from the museum area and it definitely worth it to hold on the cultural activities and give it a go!  The place has some outside seats and if the day offers some sunshine and warm weather (which is not rare in madrid) you can consume your meal outside and get the best out of this sensorial experience!  We had a bottle of wine to accompany the amazing food, vino blanco which goes along pretty well with fish. The grilled octopus with potatoes was fabulous, same for the risotto mushrooms and ham on top. A dish of prawns to conclude the lunch with dignity is mandatory. Tips: order half portion to stick with the spanish manner (tapas). Ultimately you can share the dish and get to try everything!!

The waiter was very helpful and suggested a great wine.  If you want to maximize the experience, book ahead and get there early. We were the first ones there and they gave us an unobstructed table right in front. Saw some people coming in later who threw a fit at being seated in the back behind a column of pillars.  Also in terms of price, I'd compare it to a semi-fancy NYC restaurant and then going to see a full price Broadway show afterwards, maybe with parking and babysitting on top. But the show was worth it.  Also you'll see all the celebrity photo's of people who've been there, and its definitely on the list of places to go. It's full of tourist but fun.

I went through a couple of reviews and was extremely excited to give it a try because everyone seemed to love it.  First things first. Our waiter Johnny is a local and was the most kind and attentive waiter I have experienced in my 3 weeks here in Madrid. He alone is worth the trip as he works here every day.  It was only a five minute walk from our Airbnb which was very nice to start off with. Upon arrival we were immediately greeted and taken care. We decided to sit outside because it was a nice night and I couldn't have been happier about the choice. Now for the food. We skipped right over the appetizers and went straight into the meals. 100% recommend ordering a bunch of the half plates. We started off the risotto which was phenomenal. Next we had the ropa views which with the chips was delicious, I'd recommend trying it with the warm bread that they give you. We finished off with the garlic prawns and the solomillo+Sur. The sauce for the garlic prawns was to die for as dipping sauce for you bread.  10/10 recommend for anyone visiting.

First evening we chose seafood from the menu and were very pleased with that. Especially grilled squid was marvelous. Our waiter during that evening was very friendly, but seemed not to understand English at all. Luckily starter and main course menu was available in English, but in ordering dessert we had a bit communication problems. With help of another friendly English-speaking waiter we succeeded however to order also dessert. During second evening I ordered beef with potatoes and my wife chosed salad. Those were not as good choices as we had during our first evening. Beef was quite tough although taste was very good. Potatoes were not warmed enough. Salad was ok.

Staff was friendly, efficient, informative re menu, wine recommendations, etc. The brother/owners were welcoming and helpful with reservations, and pretty much everyone's English was better than our Spanish. Both meals were excellent. For starters we had tapas on both nights, the first the ""Iberian Combination"" which includes the restaurant's own ham, which is really pretty spectacular. The second night we tried the Traditional tapas, which included among other items a delicious bit of omelette, and the restaurant's own chorizo. The main courses we tried were also fine: cod loin tempura-style, lamb chops, and on our second visit T-bone for two. (BTW, and although based on admittedly limited samples, in Madrid it seems ""medium rare"" means no-kidding-rare -- OK with us, but bear it in mind when ordering.) We shared a bottle of Sierra Cantabria tempranillo on both nights, excellent and well priced. We ate upstairs, at one of four 'high chair' tables in the back of the restaurant, a pleasant and intimate brick walled space. There's a pretty cool antique vaulted space downstairs, which we would have tried, but was booked. The restaurant was fully booked both nights, and we couldn't get in later than 8p, early for Madrid. Well worth it, however, and we really enjoyed this place. We were encouraged that, although right across from the Royal Palace, and providing English menus and website access, the restaurant seemed to be mostly patronized by Madrideños rather than out of towners. Nothing against us tourists! But Madrid is by all accounts a food-loving and -knowledgeable city, and we thought this spoke well for the quality of food, wine, value, and service at La Mi Venta.

The food (both of us Menu del Dia choices @ €9,50 for wine, starter, main and coffee) was really quite good. Interesting choices, served with warmth and grace by very nice young men, though in an unprepossessing location.  The sidewalk tables make this mostly a sunny day choice, probably. (We did not look inside.) and great for people watching and soaking up Madrid at a place frequented primarily by Spanish speakers.  Don't expect a menu in any language other than Spanish or to be served in any language other than Spanish. Do not, however, be afraid to give your Spanish its best go, nor to be adventurous in your choice. (A Wordreference app on your cell wouldn't hurt.) I ended up with thinly sliced eel in scrambled eggs for my starter and ate it all. Never had eel before; Never wanted it; Never thought to want it. But was it good here? Definitely yes. Would I have it again? Maybe.  Our mains (properly cooked cod over sliced potatoes in an indescribably good cooking sauce for me and thinly sliced or beaten veal with potato and peppers for my wife) were equally good and high quality fare. My wife raved about the tastes of what she had before her. I was too busy enjoying mine to try hers.  All this to say that I am very pleased to be able to recommend this restaurant highly.  It is not 'fine dining', but it is excellent fare, well prepared, well served and, certainly, good value for money.

The staff were so friendly and welcoming - particularly Alex and Carla. The owner has chosen his staff well - they make a great team and their friendliness made all the difference to the eating out experience. We don't speak much Spanish (a great understatement) and they really took the time to go through the menu and explain (in English) all the dishes - nothing was too much trouble. We'd enjoyed it so much we went back again. The food was excellent - as per other reviewers we had the Ropa vieja (which is a bit like pulled beef with fried potatoes - divine) and the Solomillo - pork tenderloin in a wonderful rich wine sauce - out of this world - and the Lomo al Oporto, which is a creamy pork dish with cheese and served with rice (less exciting/blander but very nice). We felt it was very good value given the food quality and service - Between us (2 people) we had 4 beers and 1 bottle Rioja, 1 tapa, 3 main courses (raciones), 1 tiramasu, and 1 coffee all for 63.65 euros.

We went on the recommendation of our hotel concierge and we enjoyed to one of our finest meals during our visit to Spain. La Mi Venta is an intimate restaurant, but comfortable. There are sidewalk tables, a first floor dining area and an elegant downstairs dining area where our party of four was seated. On a scorching hot evening, it was cool, calm and nicely lit -- like a renovated wine cellar. The wait staff have worked in Europe and the US, so they offered experience and spoke confidently in many languages. We felt right at home. The food was outstanding, beginning with some creative tapas selections: tempura hake, foie and caramelized apple, pork and grilled mushrooms. For the main entrees, we enjoyed grilled steaks (rib-eye, or something comparable), a pan-seared hake and a grilled Iberian pork steak that was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Wine and beer were plentiful and appropriately priced. The service was excellent and the total bill was much less than you would pay for a comparable meal in the US.

We were the first ones in as they must have just been opening. We were welcomed in and chatted a bit with the waitress before ordering a beer and a glass of wine which was recommended for me. Having a look at the menu we were then given a free taster, curried chicken on toasted bread, which was superb. More people came as we sat proving the little restaurant to be quite popular. We ordered three tapas dishes, all of which were delicious. We were also given bread with oil. After two glasses of wine, one beer and the tapas the bill came to 17.50! When paying we were told that as we didn't have dessert, we should have a homemade chocolate liqeur shot on the house. Fantastic food, service and atmosphere. We would both highly recommend this place to anyone and hope they continue exactly as they are providing a great experience. :) ",2015-02-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or2670-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_18561,0.011,0.817,0.173,0.986,0.3187222222222222,0.6643333333333333,0.3084363636363636,953,94,0.0986358866736621,1,21,False,47,0.1081081081081081,0.2162162162162162,0.2972972972972973,0.081081081081081,0.1621621621621621,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.054054054054054,0.027027027027027,0.027027027027027,178,116,4.353932584269663,0,0,half seen place alreadi trip advisor decid stop lunch area first one must open welcom chat bit waitress order beer glass wine recommend look menu given free taster curri chicken toast bread superb peopl came sat prove littl restaur quit popular order three tapa dish delici also given bread oil two glass wine one beer tapa bill came pay told dessert homemad chocol liqeur shot hous fantast food servic atmospher would highli recommend place anyon hope continu exactli provid great experi,good review,4

Our server Pedro was wonderful- very warm and engaging. The food and drink were hit or miss. The grilled squid with salad were excellent! Very tender and seasoned perfectly. I wish I had ordered a full order as the wok noodles with vegetables were a bit overseasoned with just soy sauce. Hubby had the seafood paella which he enjoyed (although the shrimp he gave me was a tad mushy). Don’t order the sangria- it was awful. Tasted like KoolAid. The complementary cheesecake with blueberries was delicious and so was the shot of a baileys type liqueur.

All good choices, however the Presa stood out and being something unique and really special. David was our waiter, who was attentive and passionate about the restaurant and its food. He had a great sense of humour and made the evening such fun. We will definitely be returning, not only to see the legend which is David but also to devour another Presa at such good value.",2015-04-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or830-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_18588,0.0,0.797,0.203,0.9719,0.2727443609022556,0.6125313283208019,0.2822857142857143,700,65,0.0928571428571428,0,20,False,42,0.1538461538461538,0.1794871794871795,0.3076923076923077,0.1025641025641025,0.1794871794871795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0512820512820512,0.0256410256410256,132,94,4.3106060606060606,0,0,visit restaur last night madrid saw great review want tri book tabl would recommend could get tabl pm well worth wait love bottl red wine rioja euro decid go presa steak hake good choic howev presa stood someth uniqu realli special david waiter attent passion restaur food great sens humour made even fun definit return see legend david also devour anoth presa good valu,good review,4

First visit, ordered a small El Sur salad to start and the combination of balsamic vinaigrette, walnuts and goat cheese made it excellent! The Tortilla de Patatas (Spanish omelette) came as a slice and was an egg/potato mixture-very good and I’ve seen this dish in other spots also. The special for the evening was grilled Pulpo (Octopus). Unfortunately it was chewy (& maybe this is the way it is meant to be). So possibly not cooked or brined enough. That said, the sauce made it manageable. I was offered a complimentary Cheesecake at the end of dinner which was a nice touch. Second evening, I started with the Calamari salad (Calamares a la Romana). Just the right amount of crust and the Calamari was cooked to perfection. Next was the Gambones. A garlic lover’s delight. Shrimp cooked in garlic oil so their warm bread was perfect for dipping and scooping out the Shrimp. I got a complimentary shot of Samba at the end of my meal. Amazing restaurant and bar! A laid back atmosphere where locals and tourists come together. Service was excellent.

That worked brilliantly as did the food. We ended up having dinner on 2 consecutive evenings and a lunch in between. To put it in perspective the lunch of 3 special tapas cost as much as a cardboard box of squid bits from the San Miguel market and was in a different league. Dinner was superb.. they very sensibly have a limited menu which makes choosing very difficult as all of the options are wonderful. To not have the Iberico pork would be a mistake but the burger was also very good..as was the hake... and the bass.

I went with a friend who had gone two times prior, and our experience not only lived up to the massive hype she gave the establishment, but it by and large surpassed it. We ordered three tapas dishes to start, all of which were delicious. My friend, who has ordered something different each time, asserts that you can’t go wrong with any dish on their menu. Tinto de Derano accompanied our dinner, and by the close, we were happily bemoaning about how full we were.  But our experience didn’t stop there. The servers, who were all kind and gracious, and able to accommodate an English speaker, surprised us with shots, another Tinto de Derano, and two slices of exceptional cake at the close of our meal, all on the house. My friend assured me that this was something that they do sometimes at this establishment: these generous individuals seek to provide a homestyle, Spanish, traditional culinary experience.

Finally found an amazing sea food restaurant on the outskirts of the city that I should have reviewed. On this second visit to Spain felt the need to find a good restaurant, not just a tapas bar, early on. Googled restaurants near me, and this was one came up. Impressively had exceptional reviews yesterday, day before, day before that, and so it went. Always hesitant to go somewhere with so many current good reviews, but, new in town, within walking distance, nothing to lose. Don't bother to make a reservation, it's completely booked (all the hype). Just get there ( for dinner) at 7:45pm and your sure to get either an outside table or one of the ""high/tall"" tables inside. The hype is entirely justified. We were in Madrid for 3 nights and we had dinner here every night. We chose different dishes and wines ( always extremaduran) every night. The quality and presentation was impeccable. But, the ambience, pavement, inside, and, the vibe, that crazy La Mi Venta vibe, kept us coming back for more. This place is great, not just in the Opera district of Madrid. I think this is the best restaurant in Madrid, not being a Michelin star kind of diner myself. Really, really good honest food that is both well prepared and presented, in an addictive holiday atmosphere.  Every exceptional review to date entirely justified. Do not, do not lose that mojo.",2019-10-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or80-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_18706,0.024,0.792,0.185,0.9939,0.3524905303030303,0.6135448232323233,0.3335235294117646,1459,103,0.0705962988348183,0,53,False,66,0.1168831168831168,0.1428571428571428,0.2337662337662337,0.0649350649350649,0.1688311688311688,0.0519480519480519,0.0389610389610389,0.0519480519480519,0.0779220779220779,0.0519480519480519,254,183,4.744094488188976,0,0,barcelona year ago person found whole tapa scene highli rate final found amaz sea food restaur outskirt citi review second visit spain felt need find good restaur tapa bar earli googl restaur near one came impress except review yesterday day day went alway hesit go somewher mani current good review new town within walk distanc noth lose bother make reserv complet book hype get dinner pm sure get either outsid tabl one high tall tabl insid hype entir justifi madrid night dinner everi night chose differ dish wine alway extremaduran everi night qualiti present impecc ambienc pavement insid vibe crazi la mi venta vibe kept us come back place great opera district madrid think best restaur madrid michelin star kind diner realli realli good honest food well prepar present addict holiday atmospher everi except review date entir justifi lose mojo,very good review,5

The first part, the tour with tapas in different places is indeed a great idea: from the cocktail bar to the cellar then the champagne sanctuary. However, we would have enjoyed this moment more if it hadn't been done in a hurry. Hardly, the tapas swallowed, that we had to change place. I did not even have time to finish my glass of champagne in the Sacristy. An experience in a 2-star restaurant means enjoying and savoring and not having to rush... It is a pity that the sommelier does not offer a tour of the bodega. Knowing that I didn't want the wine pairing formula, I asked him to see several rioja and white wines. The dishes did not leave me an imperishable memory, except for the pink tomato flower ice and the suckling pig with crispy skin. 2 of the main dishes were salty. The desserts were nothing extraordinary, especially for a 2-star restaurant. Once again, the ambiance and the decor are amazing, the food OK but according to me not at the level of a 2-Michelin restaurant. I was expecting more in terms of culinary experience in such a restaurant.",2020-09-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12864731-Reviews-Coque-Madrid.html,UID_18710,0.013,0.903,0.084,0.8985,0.218859649122807,0.4872807017543859,0.3130583333333332,1102,104,0.0943738656987295,0,30,False,37,0.1578947368421052,0.131578947368421,0.3157894736842105,0.0263157894736842,0.2105263157894736,0.0,0.0263157894736842,0.0263157894736842,0.0526315789473684,0.0526315789473684,200,129,4.515,0,0,took friend dinner tonight first part tour tapa differ place inde great idea cocktail bar cellar champagn sanctuari howev would enjoy moment done hurri hardli tapa swallow chang place even time finish glass champagn sacristi experi star restaur mean enjoy savor rush piti sommeli offer tour bodega know want wine pair formula ask see sever rioja white wine dish leav imperish memori except pink tomato flower ice suckl pig crispi skin main dish salti dessert noth extraordinari especi star restaur ambianc decor amaz food ok accord level michelin restaur expect term culinari experi restaur,average review,3

We were hungry for a full meal, not just just tapas, and this was very near to our hotel and we had read the reviews here and decided to chance that they had an available table that late at night. We are so glad we did, because it was fantastic! We arrived at the restaurant just before 11 pm, and the host said they could have a table for us in 10 minutes in the dining room downstairs, if we didn't mind waiting at the upstairs bar. It was a chilly night outside, and as we were waiting the host brought us 2 cups of some homemade chicken broth to warm us up until we could be seated. It was absolutely delicious, and had us looking forward to the actual meal! Our waiter was fantastic and super attentive, he helped us to pick out a great bottle of wine-letting us sample a few choices first to see what we liked- and recommended the Chuleton de Carne Roja a la Parrilla de Carbon, an approx. 1 kilo serving of steak, which was delicious and cost €40. We tried a great olive oil, which they also sold by the bottle and came packaged in a nice box(we regretted not buying one to take home with us), a salad which was very good, but no room left for any dessert.   They also had the full menu in both English and Spanish. Overall great experience, and a perfect meal.

Roberto, greeted me, asked if I just wanted tapas, or a complete meal. I wanted a complete meal, and he ushered me downstairs to 'the cave', to what appeared to be the best table in the restaurant. The cave hundreds of years ago, was a secret passage from the Royal palace to the church. It is now a church of culinary delights. The service:  The service was the best I've ever had. I usually eschew 'fine dining' places because of the stuck up service. Roberto embraces the importance of his job. For a foodie, having a 'waiter' who is completely knowledgable about product sourcing and will to spend as much as necessary, in multiple languages, to explain and describe the menu items and their sourcing is a rare find.  What is rarer was his sharing the 'joy' of my enjoyment of the food. Not only was the food incredible creative and balanced, but his timing of the meal was spot on. His genuine enjoyment of my enjoyment of the various dishes made him a partner in my meal, not just a 'waiter' or a 'server'. As for the meal itself, each dish was astoundingly well balanced. Not only in the spicing, but also in the temperature, and the quantities. Every dish had the correct amount of food so that there was the perfect amount of the various ingredients for every bite. The meal started off with a cup of hot pork bone broth - which Roberto informed me they give all of their customers during the winter months to warm them up. It was delicious. Next home baked bread with olive oil. I noticed how green the olive oil was and Roberto explained that it is world rated olive oil pressed in southern Spain. Just the first light pressing in the bottles. As he is telling me about the sourcing the fragrance wafts from the little bowl and catches my attention. It's wonderful olive oil, silky mouth, expands aromaticalily with a mild bite at the end. I order tomatoes with olive oil, garlic and a lovely flaked sea salt that give a nice little crunch along with a mini-explosion of flavor. Balance with a surprise in every bite. A 4 dimensional meal.  Then came the porterhouse steak. Cooked perfectly rare, and already sliced (a la Peter Lugers). Unfortunately Beef like this is no longer available in the USA. Chocolate mousse was the best I've ever had. Once again it was 4 dimensional. It had an almond cookie, with mousse on top of that with homemade (this morning) pistachio ice cream topped off with a slice of 70% dark cocoa chocolate with flakes of sea-salt on top. The textures hit the fork, and once in the mouth hit the tongue and the tooth (it was al-dente - if you could imagine such a thing). The meal finished off with a complementary bottle of ice cold coffee cream liquor. Roberto described it as Bailey's but they make it themselves (because baileys is too sweet). It was unctuous. This was one of the best meals I've had. The mousse, the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this place.",2016-02-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or730-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_18723,0.012,0.813,0.175,0.9985,0.3177000000000001,0.5674666666666666,0.4212270270270271,2943,253,0.0859667006455997,0,92,False,74,0.1057692307692307,0.1538461538461538,0.2980769230769231,0.0769230769230769,0.173076923076923,0.0576923076923076,0.0,0.0096153846153846,0.0865384615384615,0.0384615384615384,534,305,4.50561797752809,0,0,one best meal life roberto greet ask want tapa complet meal want complet meal usher downstair cave appear best tabl restaur cave hundr year ago secret passag royal palac church church culinari delight servic servic best ever usual eschew fine dine place stuck servic roberto embrac import job foodi waiter complet knowledg product sourc spend much necessari multipl languag explain describ menu item sourc rare find rarer share joy enjoy food food incred creativ balanc time meal spot genuin enjoy enjoy variou dish made partner meal waiter server meal dish astoundingli well balanc spice also temperatur quantiti everi dish correct amount food perfect amount variou ingredi everi bite meal start cup hot pork bone broth roberto inform give custom winter month warm delici next home bake bread oliv oil notic green oliv oil roberto explain world rate oliv oil press southern spain first light press bottl tell sourc fragranc waft littl bowl catch attent wonder oliv oil silki mouth expand aromaticalili mild bite end order tomato oliv oil garlic love flake sea salt give nice littl crunch along mini explos flavor balanc surpris everi bite dimension meal came porterhous steak cook perfectli rare alreadi slice la peter luger unfortun beef like longer avail usa chocol mouss best ever dimension almond cooki mouss top homemad morn pistachio ice cream top slice dark cocoa chocol flake sea salt top textur hit fork mouth hit tongu tooth al dent could imagin thing meal finish complementari bottl ice cold coffe cream liquor roberto describ bailey make bailey sweet unctuou one best meal mouss best ever highli recommend place,very good review,5

Very often these meals turn out to be expensive parodies of local food with random flourishes of truffles and caviar. So we were a little bit apprehensive even booking a nice restaurant when Madrid is awash in excellent little restaurants. But my god, we were happy we stuck to our system. As an experience, Coque ranks as one of the best restaurants we have visited globally. We live between Hong Kong and Paris so I do not say this lightly. We were greeted at the door and taken to a bar in the basement. We had a palette cleansing cocktail that was part ice cream part bloody Mary. From there it was on to the cellar where we has a selection of dry wines and charcuterie.  We were given a tour of the cellar and a choice of bottles. However, we are not big drinkers so we passed on this opportunity. However the labels on the bottles spoke for themselves. This is a quality cellar. We did partake in the glass of champagne on the way up to the kitchen. At the kitchen we were offered a series of appetisers to whet our palette chased down by a glass of the local beer. It sounds a lot heavier than it was. It was more like having some snacks watching a game before dinner. When we finally got to the table we were in a really good mood. This sensation only deepened as the courses came out. The restaurant is particularly strong on the interplay between temperature and texture. Seafood comes out as ice cream. Vegetables come out as warm gels. The piece de resistance however was the dessert. The presentation is insane. A giant cloud of mist reveals a generous selection of desserts, each of which would be worthy of its own dish in another restaurant. We also had the cafe gourmand at end like total pigs. The price of this experience is not cheap, but bang in line with what you pay for anywhere in the world for this many courses and this much artistry. This restaurant is a must visit date place in Madrid.

The general atmosphere and approach were fun and the food was often outstanding and very creative (although the number of courses can be substantial for some and a few courses, including the peapod, red mullet, and sashimi courses, didn't quite come together). The ""wine pairings"" were often odd (too much effort at trying to be creative) and not a good value (especially given the restaurant's great wine collection that we visited on our ""tour""). The choices (3 sherries?) didn't pair particularly well with some courses and were generally a poor representative of the current terrific state of the Spanish wine industry. Service was hit and miss--very nice until we got to the dining room stage (after arriving at the restaurant customers progress through several other locations and courses prior to that). In the dining room we seemed to have been shunted off to the side where only about half of the tables were occupied (as were 2 other tables that also appeared to have English speakers)--that would have been fine, but the primary server there did not seem particularly comfortable with conversation (at least in English) and the ""wine guy"" seemed to spend as little time and effort at communication in our section of the dining room as possible (while engaging in lengthy conversations and making far more generous wine pours elsewhere).  Overall--very creative and fun experience. Based on our experience--don't have big expectations for the wine pairings and expect inconsistent service.",2019-10-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12864731-Reviews-Coque-Madrid.html,UID_18764,0.044,0.815,0.141,0.9755,0.1349358974358974,0.5032051282051282,0.41445,1535,109,0.0710097719869706,0,49,False,44,0.1363636363636363,0.1818181818181818,0.3863636363636363,0.0454545454545454,0.1590909090909091,0.0227272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.0454545454545454,0.0227272727272727,250,162,5.14,0,0,enjoy q menu oct gener atmospher approach fun food often outstand creativ although number cours substanti cours includ peapod red mullet sashimi cours quit come togeth wine pair often odd much effort tri creativ good valu especi given restaur great wine collect visit tour choic sherri pair particularli well cours gener poor repres current terrif state spanish wine industri servic hit miss nice got dine room stage arriv restaur custom progress sever locat cours prior dine room seem shunt side half tabl occupi tabl also appear english speaker would fine primari server seem particularli comfort convers least english wine guy seem spend littl time effort commun section dine room possibl engag lengthi convers make far gener wine pour elsewher overal creativ fun experi base experi big expect wine pair expect inconsist servic,average review,3

After searching TripAdvisor, we discovered La Mi Venta that had great reviews and made reservations for 8 pm on Sunday evening (the restaurant is open from 8 pm until 2 am). Upon arrival shortly before 8 pm, we were greeted very warmly by the restaurant staff and enjoyed a glass of wine in the bar area before the Maitre d escorted my wife and I to the cellar dining area which was very cosy and very inviting. In the cellar area where we were seated, there were three tables for 2 people and another two tables for four people. The two waiters served us were absolutely great; very professional to the detail and both were very congenial and you could see how they each took great pride in their profession. My wife and I ordered the paella which takes about 40 minutes but while waiting for our main dish, we had a great starter and a great bottle of Rioja wine. When we were served our paella it was absolutely delicious and certainly the best paella I have had during my visits to various places in Spain.

This was our first experience with hams cured for 5 years and while we sampled cured ham for the next three weeks in Spain NONE matched the flavors of our first experience. Pricy sure but sooo much excellent flavor. Then to top it off they had an olive oil that won a first prize. Well we left the place with a small bottle to bring back to the US - now we need some yummy crusty bread.

An adventure that begins at the restaurant's bar, goes on to their amazing wine room, another surprise awaits by the kitchen - and finally in the main room the whole feast takes place.  The decor, the atmosphere, even the plates - every small detail is planned to compliment the food which is worth every euro. As amazing as the whole thing is, and as much as the waiters are trying, their English is just not good enough and that's a shame. I realize that in most restaurants in Madrid we got lucky if we found one waiter who knew a few words in English at all. Here they tried their best, but we had a hard time communicating and truly understanding everything. In such high level restaurant, where they put so much effort in the whole experience, a non-Spanish guest feels a bit lost and lacks the ability to fully understand everything that is going on. This is the only reason they lost 1 point on service for us.

This 2-star Michelin restaurant made for such an interesting and memorable evening.....like no restaurant we have ever visited. It was an over the top experience! 27 courses by the way but who is counting....As you enter the restaurant you are escorted to an elevator that takes you downstairs to a bar where things begin..a couple of tapas and beverage and then off to the next stop....the wine room. Here we enjoyed some sherry and tapas while we selected our red wine for the evening. Next stop was the champagne cellar for a bit of bubbly before making our way to the kitchen for a hands on view of the action with more tapas and beverage. Only now do we head to our dinner table after course #12! The remaining 15 are at the table which doesn’t count the bread option where you are offered 4 different olive oils and 4 different salt choices. Crazy! The remainder of the menu offered a bit of everything all done so meticulously with the highlight being roasted suckling pig which was mind blowing! Everything was sooo delicious! Service was stellar! Alberto was awesome and definitely enhanced the experience.

The rest of the meal was exceptional. Wine pairings available or make your own selection from a pretty amazing wine cellar ! Exceptional service.

When you arrive you are seated at the bar and have a few delicious snacks and a welcome cocktail. Then you are escorted to the wine cellar for a demonstration of sherry pouring and more snacks. Then to the champagne cellar for champagne and more snacks. Next stop is the kitchen - beer and snacks and last stop in back of kitchen more drink and snacks.... Then you are seated at the main dinner for a 12 course meal. All small bites and very innovative- you will love some and maybe not love them all. But you will appreciate the innovation and adventure! We did the wine pairings and so we had Akita’s of interesting wines. Our favorite courses were the sashimi and the pig - the later was a reimagined specialty of the area. Leave room to eat this! Desserts were fun! Most amazingly this extravagant dinner and complex stops throughout the restaurant took only a bit over two hours - not rushed at all just perfectly timed and coordinated.

My guest and I did the wine pairing with the menu and the sommelier did an excellent job of introducing some very interest bottles to the mix, including Spanish Finos and Amontillados which I really enjoy.

My father rated it as having the best food he had in Europe so far.  I rated it with best service (food came reallyyyy fast although the restaurant was full and the owners and waiters were very hospitable, friendly and helpful) So this is what we ordered to share amongst 4 people:  1. Mediterranean salad 2. Grilled squid 3. Flank (chef recommended) 4. Salmon tempura skewers 5. Grilled prawns with garlic 6. Chicken curry 7. Cod fish  8. And last, we received free cake for dessert. Because couldn't finish what we ordered (we ordered way too much food), so the owners thought that we were not satisfied with the food and insisted on giving us a free cake (which we finished of course because it was so good) The restaurant was packed with tourists and locals and they all seemed to enjoy their food too. Other positive points: 1. It is located in a great neighbourhood, good to have a stroll after your big meal when the weather is good. 2. Very reasonably priced 3.

The evening began so well, the restaurant is beautiful and the concept of taking a tour with appetisers in the bar, bodega, kitchen and bakery (already described at length by other reviewers) is interesting and very enjoyable. The Bodega in particular is spectacular and we would have enjoyed more time there to browse the wine collection. When finally seated in the dining room for the tasting menu the service from the waiting staff was friendly, professional and faultless.  The disappointment for us began with some of the wines offered by the young sommelier. After seeing the Bodega we expected to be introduced to some excellent wines during our meal - but sadly this was not the case and we now wish we had simply chosen a good bottle from the Bodega ourselves. (The previous evening at another establishment - 1 star - we had been blown away by the wine pairing). The food was certainly innovative, beautifully presented (except for the very simple and ubiquitous suckling pig) and mostly enjoyable, although the dessert, whilst theatrical, was not special. It is a fact of life that when arriving at an expensive 2 star restaurant, one´s expectations are already sky high - and unfortunately on this occasion we left somewhat deflated.",2018-12-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12864731-Reviews-or10-Coque-Madrid.html,UID_18879,0.045,0.793,0.162,0.9813,0.2221469155844155,0.5916659902597403,0.7760125,1345,106,0.078810408921933,0,28,False,36,0.1692307692307692,0.1692307692307692,0.2615384615384615,0.0615384615384615,0.1692307692307692,0.0,0.0461538461538461,0.0153846153846153,0.0615384615384615,0.0461538461538461,227,150,4.92511013215859,0,0,read mani posit review expect bowl star restaur even began well restaur beauti concept take tour appetis bar bodega kitchen bakeri alreadi describ length review interest enjoy bodega particular spectacular would enjoy time brows wine collect final seat dine room tast menu servic wait staff friendli profession faultless disappoint us began wine offer young sommeli see bodega expect introduc excel wine meal sadli case wish simpli chosen good bottl bodega previou even anoth establish star blown away wine pair food certainli innov beauti present except simpl ubiquit suckl pig mostli enjoy although dessert whilst theatric special fact life arriv expens star restaur one expect alreadi sky high unfortun occas left somewhat deflat,very bad review,1

But beyond that, the entire experience is whimsical and fun. You're not just sitting in a dining room eating imaginative food. You are moving throughout the restaurant and are part of the experience. Your only option is the tasting menu. When we went, it was called Q18+, 18 courses at 195 Euros per person. (It's not cheap.) We went with the recommended wine pairings for an additional 115 Euros per person (though you could also go with a bottle from their wine room). You start in the bar for the first three courses (cocktail, bloody mary ice cream, chip with guacamole and foie). Then to the wine cellar for three more courses (sherry, bread with bull sausage, paprika macaron). Then into the champagne room (champagne grape, mimosa). Then to the kitchen for a beer, prawn, and an inventive take on Spanish omelet. So you're only about halfway finished by the time you move to the main dining room for the remainder of the food parade, which includes prawns, octopus, bluefin tuna, tripes, suckling pig, then an assortment of small desserts. As you would expect, the service is top notch -- you can't walk to the bathroom without being escorted by one or two of the workers. The food is creatively presented. It is fun, delicious, and memorable. They are creative takes on Spanish cuisine. Some parts might feel a little gimmicky, but it's fun. You'll need a reservation. We made ours a few days ahead of time, and they were booked, but we asked to be placed on the waitlist and were fortunate that something opened up and we got in. Yes, it is expensive, but it is also a meal you will never forget.",2018-12-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12864731-Reviews-or10-Coque-Madrid.html,UID_18880,0.016,0.838,0.147,0.9925,0.1443055555555555,0.5866666666666667,0.2861619047619047,1768,147,0.0831447963800905,0,67,False,59,0.1325301204819277,0.180722891566265,0.3012048192771084,0.0602409638554216,0.108433734939759,0.0240963855421686,0.036144578313253,0.0240963855421686,0.1204819277108433,0.0120481927710843,315,208,4.6158730158730155,0,0,lack word describ amaz experi dine coqu friend food outstand would expect michelin star beyond entir experi whimsic fun sit dine room eat imagin food move throughout restaur part experi option tast menu went call q cours euro per person cheap went recommend wine pair addit euro per person though could also go bottl wine room start bar first three cours cocktail bloodi mari ice cream chip guacamol foie wine cellar three cours sherri bread bull sausag paprika macaron champagn room champagn grape mimosa kitchen beer prawn invent take spanish omelet halfway finish time move main dine room remaind food parad includ prawn octopu bluefin tuna tripe suckl pig assort small dessert would expect servic top notch walk bathroom without escort one two worker food creativ present fun delici memor creativ take spanish cuisin part might feel littl gimmicki fun need reserv made day ahead time book ask place waitlist fortun someth open got ye expens also meal never forget,very good review,5

Now that it has relocated to central Madrid it's easy to access from hotels via a short taxi ride. The new location is really impressive- high ceilings, beautiful wall coverings, lots of marble, all elegant and modern. The din go. experience begins with a cocktail and two amuses in the bar area. Then one moves to the wine ""cellar"" area for sherry and another two amuses, then to the Dom Perignon area for tow more amuses. The pre-meal excursion ends in the spacious, well-lit kitchen for some locally-produced beer and two more amuses. The wine list is accessed via an iPad- we found two great wines to accompany our meal, including a 1995 Muga Prado Enea! The tasting menu itself consists of ten courses- several seafood and veggie dishes, plus a fabulous suckling pig. Our meal concluded with a set of five small desserts plus a dry ice ""fountain"" and a set of four mignardises. We immensely enjoyed the 4 hours we spent at Coque, and we hope to see it awarded a third Michelin star in the near future.",2018-11-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12864731-Reviews-or10-Coque-Madrid.html,UID_4148,0.0,0.82,0.18,0.9909,0.2549143610013175,0.4675164690382081,0.4400200000000001,1127,79,0.0700976042590949,1,32,False,39,0.08,0.24,0.32,0.04,0.12,0.0,0.04,0.0,0.16,0.0,203,145,4.556650246305419,0,0,dine coqu sever time human de madrid suburb requir minut drive citi reloc central madrid easi access hotel via short taxi ride new locat realli impress high ceil beauti wall cover lot marbl eleg modern din go experi begin cocktail two amus bar area one move wine cellar area sherri anoth two amus dom perignon area tow amus pre meal excurs end spaciou well lit kitchen local produc beer two amus wine list access via ipad found two great wine accompani meal includ muga prado enea tast menu consist ten cours sever seafood veggi dish plu fabul suckl pig meal conclud set five small dessert plu dri ice fountain set four mignardis immens enjoy hour spent coqu hope see award third michelin star near futur,very good review,5
