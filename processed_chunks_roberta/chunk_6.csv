The fish mousse was very tasty and the octopus was quite a large portion. The ham croquettes were hot and tasty and the mixed paella (seafood, chicken and veg) was enough 2 people and a reasonable price also (20 euro's).

Our waiter was lovely and took the time to talk us through the menu. We orders 5 tapas and our waiter did advise us that 4 would be enough. We went ahead with 5 and have to agree 4 was plenty! We didn't have any cocktails but saw a lot of people with them and they looked good. One of the cheapest places for cocktails in Madrid. The food was amazing. I've eaten out at 5 tapas bars and this one was by far the best. It was unbelievably cheap for huge portions and high quality food.

The problem with the menu was that it was beef as the main course and not everyone was a meat eater in our group, but the manager was very helpful and allowed us to order fish and 6 out of 8 ordered the fish. So very nice of him to accommodate us. We had wine with dinner and again the manager selected a white and a red that were priced very well 15 and 19 EURO.

I ordered a simple pasta dish with tomato, eggplant, and mozzarella. The tomato sauce was tasty enough but the eggplant pieces were small and hard to find. And the biggest disappointment was the mozzarella. Considering this is a “mozzarella bar” I was expecting some nice chunks of mozzarella, but I couldn’t see any cheese at all. I even asked the waiter if it was the correct dish and if there was mozzarella in it. He assured me there was but I never found any evidence of it. I tried to compensate by adding parmesan, but the stuff they had on the table was a kind of cheap, fake, sawdust parmesan, it wasn’t real cheese.  Service was friendly enough though I had to ask several times for the bill. All in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience. The food seemed to be an experiment by the ownwers in how to wring the most money out of their customers while offering the least acceptable food. I have an apartment nearby but won’t be back. I think they must survive off the tourist trade due to their location on Gran Via.

Assumed that if they bother to do that they would care about the food - and they do ! On a very busy Saturday evening we had to wait for a table having made no reservation, but were offered a complementary beer whilst we watched the frantic escapades of the large staff taking orders from the kitchen. We learned where the ingredients for Chocolate Brownie are kept and could have made one ourselves if asked (popular dessert - we had it too and very good).

The decor, music, ambience are quit good but the execution of the menu falls off in ways that are easily rectified. We ordered the tavola tapas to share which was good across the board and nicely presented. The bread was a poor choice however.  We followed that with two pasta dishes. I rarely if ever order pasta carbonara when not in Rome but I made an exception because it was touted on the menu as being 'authentic'. My partner ordered the pappardelle with 'pearls de trufa' and porcinni mushrooms. Carbonara is a classic dish with four key ingredients. Unfortunately one of the four was completely absent; there was no fresh cracked pepper to be seen anywhere on the plate. The guanciale was included but in large pieces instead of lardons. The dish was dry and coagulated into a lump shortly after it arrived at the table. The pappardelle was on the soupy side with too much cream and no noticeable taste of truffles. Some closer attention to details in the kitchen would be a huge improvement to an otherwise pleasant experience. The staff did a very good job.

Food: We ordered a Torreta De Huevos (Torreta Egg with sliced roasted potatoes), Bacalao (salt cods with prawns), 1/2 rabas (squid rings), a strawberries mojito, a toffee cheesecake and a bottle of water.  The Torreta egg potatoes was the star of the day. It came in a pot with large portion. The egg yolks were still runny and lovely. The roasted potatoes were hot and crispy. The aubergine and parma ham added a bit of extra taste to the texture and it was a perfect dish. The Salt cods with prawns came in 4 pieces each and they were fantastic too. The butter coated cod were crispy outside and the fishes were very moist inside, they melt in my mouth and were not oily at all. The prawns were also fresh and delicious when dipped into the olive oil. The squid rings was supposed to be a tapas as it cost only 5 Euro, but the portion was surprisingly big. The squids were hot, meaty and crispy and it married so well with the freshness of the salad dressing. The strawberries mojito was another amazing cocktail as I never had mojito with strawberries before. Everything was outstanding and tasty. (I forgot to add that it came with sliced of breads and cheese canapé (on the house))  Service: The staffs were very friendly and helpful. The female staff explained to me patiently about each dish from the menu and she gave us good recommendations. She also warned me that I ordered too much initially. The rest of the staffs were also very kind and kept checking whether we were happy during our meal. The food were served fast to the table. The service was 5 stars.  Restaurant: El Mini Bar is a very low key restaurant which located at the basement. From the exterior, it's hard to tell that it is a restaurant. However, the interior design is lovely and cosy. It is a bit dark as it looks like a bar (which it is) rather than a restaurant, but I love it. I also like the portraits of celebrities and presidents on the wall. The seats and tables are comfortable too. I felt very relax and cheerful dinning there. Price: Bacalao (13), Torreta (9), Rabas (5), Mojito (7), Water (1.5), toffee cheesecake (4.5). A full belly lunch for two people cost less than 40 Euro (+ tips, which I gave a lot (10 euro) because I was extremely satisfied). It's been the cheapest meal we had in Madrid but its food quality and quantity were the best. In summary, the food quality here was great, it's cheap, and the service was flawless. The only slight downside was the restaurant at the basement, as some people would prefer to sit under the sunshine or outdoor. It's my best restaurant in Madrid and it was also the best Spanish meal I had in my life. It deserves a 10 stars rating if Trip Advisor allows me. 100% recommended! Wish I will return one day.

The food was just the right mix of adventurous but comforting. It is nice to be an appreciated guest and have delicious food.

At the end of the meal they provided cookies and lilac flavored candy. Now the food Review:  It wasn't good. We ordered the stew available on Weds and Fri evening which was billed as the specialty of the house and a tradition carried over from the founder of the restaurant. It came out as very dry meat (and body parts from various animals) on top of garbanzo beans with a boiled carrot and potato thrown in. I don't know which was grossest: the chunk of blood sausage, the chunk of completely well done dried out beef or the giant pig ear in the middle of the plate.  As I am writing this review, I am finding it hard to believe that A) I actually ate some of it and B) how utterly gross it was.  The other problem is the very limited menu selection. There were only 4 or 5 main entree choices and unfortunately I the chose the house specialty for the evening. Perhaps the other menu selections are better but I can only share my experience.",2015-07-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7622713-Reviews-or130-GastroVia_61-Madrid.html,UID_5938,0.058,0.869,0.073,0.4922,0.1300198412698412,0.5412797619047619,0.3603545454545455,1080,100,0.0925925925925925,0,24,False,27,0.125,0.125,0.25,0.05,0.175,0.025,0.05,0.05,0.1,0.05,199,140,4.417085427135678,0,0,posit server sandra accommod friendli attent bread good plenti husband love cosmo end meal provid cooki lilac flavor candi food review good order stew avail wed fri even bill specialti hous tradit carri founder restaur came dri meat bodi part variou anim top garbanzo bean boil carrot potato thrown know grossest chunk blood sausag chunk complet well done dri beef giant pig ear middl plate write review find hard believ actual ate b utterli gross problem limit menu select main entre choic unfortun chose hous specialti even perhap menu select better share experi,very bad review,1

I have to say I would be amazed if there are not many more than 10 restaurants which are better than this in Madrid. The waiting staff were generally keen but seemed vague and unsure what to do-and when to do it. They didn't speak English well (or at all) and took a very long time to take our drinks order- then ages to bring the drinks. The bread arrived with- out butter and we had to ask twice for it. The food (when it finally arrived) was average to good - but not great. No wine list ever appeared - apart from about half a dozen wines mentioned at the end of the food menu. With some difficulty I ordered a piccolo bottle of cava- that then disappeared never to be seen again -although there was still about 40% of the contents left. So, although we enjoyed our meal - this was hardly an A grade restaurant to appear in the same company as those with Michelin stars.

What a mistake! My starter was a dish of coagulated melted cheese, with a couple of skimpy slices of pepper on top, not impressive. Unfortunately our waiter didn't have the best English and got our main course incorrect. As I'm a vegetarian I couldn't eat what we were given, even though I did feel sorry for him! So another waiter came to sort our order and I clarified our order, and made sure he understood that I was a vegetarian. About 20 minutes later our pizzas arrived, and mine was covered in anchovies! I called the waiter again and he apologised and took the pizza away, returning to the table less than a couple of minutes later with what was obviously the same pizza with the anchovies taken off! I just couldn't believe it and was not prepared to order a main course for the third time so we left the restaurant. My advice is to stick to the more traditional Spanish restaurants and don't bother with this place.

Found the place on line, and wife saw the Burrata with Pesto and was “soooo, going there”. We didn’t have reservations and place was packed, but the host Alex gave us a table that they had set up for a party of 9, but wouldn’t be there for an hour. Plenty of time for us I mentioned to him. He sat us in the coolest pink flamingo room downstairs and we pretty much had a private “suite” to enjoy our meal. Our server was awesome and we even had a great conversation with Javi, the executive chef, about food and Madrid and other spots. He gave us some great recommendations of pastry shops for breakfast or snacks the next day, which we went to (Pasteleria Del Pozo and CasaMira for fresh made turrón). We had a blast.

All the food we saw looked delicious. The dishes we ordered were spectacular. We had the squid strips. The cornmeal crust was crispy and crunchy and not greasy. The squid was incredibly tender. It squid cane on a bed of salad with a light aioli sauce on it. A nice contrast of tender and crunchy, hot and cold. We moved onto the pankitos. They were like chicken tenders served in a paper cone and with three sauces. Like the squid they were juicy and hot encased in a crisp crunchy deep fried coating. The three sauces were lovely. We saved the grilled goat cheese for last as recommended by two young lads from Manchester. They were so right. The cheese was very smooth and melty. We could not get enough of the tomato jam. I am glad we reserved some of our table bread to soak up the yumminess. Manners prevented me from licking the plate clean. Although truth be told, if my family wasn't with me I would have.  We also ordered a bocadilla. Warm crusty bread cradling the fragrant and fatty Serrano ham. By itself it would have been satisfying. But suffering from comparison to the other dishes, it was merely delicious.  Oh and the mural of Freddie Mercury on the wall of the men's room was an added surprise. Thanks fellow reviewers.

We were presented with an amuse bouche of chicken pate served with crispy toast.  For a starter my wife and I shared the tuna tartare. This was more than enough for two and really lovely.  For mains my wife had the cod and I had the sea bass on a skewer. This was presented and filleted by the waitress at the table. Both our mains were lovely, generous and beautifully presented. For dessert we shared the chocolate bomb. Lovely.  We both had coffees and were presented with a complimentary liqueur.  You are charged €2,50 for bead and €4 for a bottle of water, which I know niggles some people. I would say that a bottle of wine at this restaurant starts at just €10 which is amazing for a restaurant of this quality. We had a very nice dry white for just €14. Throughout the service was very, very good. For three courses, a bottle of wine and coffees we paid €103 which is extremely goid value for the setting, service and excellent quality of food.

It costs about 90 euro. The food was okay. I have got a feeling that they do try to make it a fine-dining-ish experience, but they are still not there yet. The taste is somewhere between basic yummy and excellent. The ""food drawings"" on the plate merely serves to decorate. I cannot see the imagination and artistic bits.  The real problem is the service. The waiter might have felt nervous or something. He made several mistakes including dropping one knife from the table right in front of my face.

We had a cheese and meat board to share for starters which was fab. I had a pizza for main and (I think) it was the nicest pizza I have ever had. I can't remember the name but it had honey and BBQ on it! My friend is a ceoliac and even though it was disappointing that there was only one option for her, her risotto was also delicious. I didn't intend on having dessert but my friends talked me into it and oh my days, we got the biscotti and I had to begrudgingly share it. It was absolutely superb.

Staff being slow, rude and inconsiderate of customers. Not only was the service unbelievable slow but when staff eventually came to take order or deliver drinks/ food they just come down drop everything and run away. Since it was first time for my partner to experience oven we decided to get a starter, when still eating starter the mains arrived. When these arrived the female waiter attempted to remove the unfinished starter, when I said we were still eating she let out a big sigh, basically dropping plate on table and storming off. This was not the first time in this experience my partner and I have felt that the staff did not want any customers to be their and them not to be working. Even the staffs attitude to tasks, for example when I asked for a spoon with pasta I waited over 15 mins till I eventually got up and asked another waiter.

We were seated and presented with a menu very quickly. The head waiter harrumphed a bit when we were not ready to order in a few minutes (the menu is quite big and detailed) but returned a little while later for our order. The starters were excellent, the only issue I have is one of the waiting staff removing my wife's plate whilst I was still eating, he then tried to take my plate as I was knife and fork in hand and quite obviously not finished - incredible! Mains of sea bream and steak were both very good, the steak was one of the tastiest I have ever eaten. However, the staff started to prepare to serve our mains before we had finished our starters.

After a while you notice that it is only an illusion, due to walls covered with mirrors. As a matter of fact there are not very many tables available. With the menu, they also delivered a small ”dictionary”, which explained Spanish words and expressions used in the menu. Wonderful idea! (Hope they attach this also on their web-page.) After the kitchens´ greeting we shared a ”Villa of grilled white asparagus and “Corte” of octopus on nuts and tomatoes in vinaigrette”, which was very good. My main – ”Guadarrama grilled sirloin steak with slices of foie gras and “glaseás“ mini onions flavoured with berries” was delicious. Unfortunately my wife had suffered for a couple of days with stomach problems and was not able to enjoy much of her “Más chulo que un ocho“ beef tenderloin grilled over holm oak charcoal”. As dessert, my wife enjoyed “De Madrid al cielo“ Mont Blanc with chocolate, orange and Cointreau ice cream"" which looked very exotic and was very good. I enjoyed a tasty ”Coffee bavarois with chocolate and crunchy “¡Barquillos de canela para el nene y la nena!” (wafers).

When we entered, the place got my attention right away with its ultra trendy design, buzz and nice smell of food from the kitchen located at the side of the ground floor. We were greeted right away and shown to the table, explained all and got an english version of the menu. We chose the Burrata Iberica with a bit of bread, bottle of Tempranillo from Ribera del Duero, Prosciutto pizza and Burrata y Jamón Iberico pizza. Starter arrived quite fast and was already a great sign of a good choice. Full of flavour in great combination of cheese and jamon, bread still warm as brought fresh from the oven. We managed the starter in no time and moved onto the pizzas. As 38 years old pizza lover I have quite a few pizzas under my belt;))) and still this was something I would call the best pizza of my life (talking about the Burrata y Jamon iberico). Melted burrata together with warm jamon, melting on its top, together with couple of fresh basil leaves.. absolute treat.. After finishing the pizza, we ordered couple of desserts. Tiramisu and Biscotti al Forno. The later was the winner there, again full of flavours and an absolute delight, accompanying the well tasting coffee too. The place is very neatly made, nice decor, great lights, kitchen on display, toilets in a great design with nice idea of the deep sinks, plus very nice view at grand via. Service wise, fully staffed and easy to get attention of anyone when needed, needless to say that everyone was very friendly and polite with genuine smiles. I guess working in a place where you’re proud of what you’re serving makes a huge difference for both sides, the customer and staff. To summarise it, the bill was a great surprise as well as with water, bottle of wine, starter, 2 pizzas, 2 coffees, 2 desserts and bread came to €68.. With the quality of ingredients the value is definitely great and worth of visiting and coming back again and again!;) Thank you!!",2018-05-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8735932-Reviews-or300-Oven_Mozzarella_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_3452,0.005,0.736,0.259,0.9986,0.4034892598343685,0.6185817805383022,0.43015,2013,148,0.0735221063089915,3,57,False,77,0.1547619047619047,0.1309523809523809,0.3333333333333333,0.0833333333333333,0.1309523809523809,0.0357142857142857,0.0238095238095238,0.0476190476190476,0.0476190476190476,0.0119047619047619,361,225,4.578947368421052,0,0,found place pure luck pass shop need quick bite enter place got attent right away ultra trendi design buzz nice smell food kitchen locat side ground floor greet right away shown tabl explain got english version menu chose burrata iberica bit bread bottl tempranillo ribera del duero prosciutto pizza burrata jam n iberico pizza starter arriv quit fast alreadi great sign good choic full flavour great combin chees jamon bread still warm brought fresh oven manag starter time move onto pizza year old pizza lover quit pizza belt still someth would call best pizza life talk burrata jamon iberico melt burrata togeth warm jamon melt top togeth coupl fresh basil leav absolut treat finish pizza order coupl dessert tiramisu biscotti al forno later winner full flavour absolut delight accompani well tast coffe place neatli made nice decor great light kitchen display toilet great design nice idea deep sink plu nice view grand via servic wise fulli staf easi get attent anyon need needless say everyon friendli polit genuin smile guess work place proud serv make huge differ side custom staff summaris bill great surpris well water bottl wine starter pizza coffe dessert bread came qualiti ingredi valu definit great worth visit come back thank,very good review,5

It was quite full when we arrived and were seated on the first floor which wasn’t that cozy as the restaurant itself. We asked straight away if there was a free table downstairs we could get it. After a couple of minutes they transferred us downstairs. The prices are really nice, and the goat cheese is a recommended highly by us. They made it with crystallized sugar on top which made a crispy layer all over the plate, and tomato jam to complete the dish. Several courses (just a lot of food) and a bottle of wine under 60€ for the two of us. Money well spent. If we have the chance we would come back for sure and would recommend the restaurant.

We had their grilled goat cheese tapa which was one of the best things we ate in Madrid. We also had the chicken pankitas which were like chicken tempura with three tasty dipping sauces. As good as the food was,probably the best thing was the service with a smile. These guys truly go out of their way to make your visit special. I also saw many drinks being made and enjoyed(A little early for us).

On arrival we recieved a lovely greeting and once I quickly used up my total Spanish vocabulary in around 1 minute which we all had a laugh at we got a table near the bar. There is some lovely art around the place and the general vibe in the place is relaxed and enjoyable. We ordered some sangria each which was delicious and is up there with the best ive tried of the mini tour of Spain I am currently on. We were also given some aperitifs while we browsed the menu which were very tasty. Toastado with salmon. Our waiter gave us an english menu (gracias!) and proceeded to make some recommendations of their popular dishes. We had the wild boar which comes wrapped in a thin pastry and topped with a creamy mushroom sauce over about half of it which was perfect as the pastry stayed crisp and was not too rich. We also had the calamari, steak slices and a main course of what I think was battered cod sliced into 4 with a large prawn on each piece of cod lying in a bed of garlic sauce. We were brought some bread which was perfect for mopping up the plates and washed it all down with another glass of the delicious sangria. I think the bill (without tip) came to around 42euros.

Tucked away on a side street off of Calle Mayor it is easy to pass by. My wife and I went for lunch and felt comfortable as soon as we entered. The restuarant inside is below street level but it is a unique and welcoming atmosphere. We went to many restaurants on our trip to Spain but we really felt that they went out of there way to make us feel comfortable which was not always the case with all the places we ate. Seating is limited but tables are spread out giving us plenty of privacy. Their tapas menu had many unique offerings. We had their specialty-grilled goat cheese and also pankitas(chicken tempura). I should also mention they brought us an appetizer before our order with no charge! These guys aim to please. My wife and I felt they were as good as any tapas on our 10 day trip. Can't see how anyone could find a better place for a casual lunch or dinner. Wish we had a place like this in the states.

He truly wanted all his customers to have a good meal, a good time, and enjoy themselves. He stoped multiple times to our table to make sure that we were well taken care of. It’s also important to say that the place was packed and we went as the Spaniards do to have dinner late at night after 10 PM.The tapas were not only large and fairly priced but excellent. There are many daily specials and I strongly recommend that you follow their advice and eat their best dishes as they come out. Even though we think of tapas as small dishes here they’re quite large and a meal by themselves. Our daughter is a vegan and they made every effort to make her feel welcomed and attended.

This is not only a cool location with nice and friendly people but the food is really good and you get a lot of value for the prize you pay. Much more than in many other places in Madrid!!

We stayed at the Hyatt Calle Gran Via so searched for restaurants we could take a walk too. Before dinner we found a place for a beverage, Royale, then continued on to the restaurant located in the Hotel Mayorazgo. The restaurant is the GastroVia61. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, it could not have been made better. They think of everything. The passed bread basket, the after dinner digestive, the complimentary croquettes. We had a few small plates: octopus, ceviche, gazpacho, and shared the steak tartare. And before I forget let me comment o. How reasonable the wines by the bottle are. We had a bottle of Verdejo. Now back to the food. Everything was the perfect size for sharing, it was delicious and the steak tartare was prepared tableside.

It was literally the worst restaurant experience I’ve ever had.  I don’t think it’s fair to only bag places for the stuff they do wrong so I’ll start with the positives- the presentation of the food was very creative, like “master chef” and presented in a Michelin Star way (ie explaining each dish, the ideas behind it and how to eat it etx). The restaurant was clean.  Now for the rest. We were a party of four people and on the menu we were offered two options. The long menu and the short menu. The same food in both and one with a couple of extra dishes. Turns out one of the people with us doesn’t eat seafood. And quite a few dishes in the menu contained seafood. The staff refused to change any of the dishes or offer any alternative. It was explained that she wasn’t “obliged” to eat anything but the menu was offered to a full table, ie she could have not ordered anything otherwise. So the only three options available were: all of us leave without eating (this option meant paying a large amount anyway, as a “depósit”), for the three of us to eat and for her to watch and maybe eat something later, or for all of us to order the full menu and for her to just leave the dishes without eating them. So we ended up ordering menus for everyone.  The first “dish” was a “caldo” that was very good. It had an Asian type flavour and was well presented and elaborated.  The rest of the dishes were very well presented (as I’ve mentioned above) and mostly were inedible. We tried different dishes (like tendons) which were very creative and not pleasant to eat at all. I’m not a fussy eater at all (I’ve eaten insects, live prawns, etc) and many of the dishes we couldn’t finish, despite being hungry. Our friend who didn’t eat seafood could only eat certain dishes anyway and even those weren’t edible. So of the whole menu, there were dishes that were unedible and those which were edible and not good. For the whole meal we were trying to look for positive things to say about the food (i support and respect creative cuisine) and couldn’t. The waitress asked us for our opinion of each different dish and it was obvious (by us not finishing the food) that we weren’t impressed by the dishes. She seemed surprised and insinuated that we were in the wrong because their dishes were amazing (according to her). At the end of the meal we set to pay (the restaurant is very expensive, especially considering our experience) and we expressed our deception between our expectations of how the experience would be and how it was. We were then insulted by the chef, the waitress and told basically that we were wrong and didn’t appreciate their food and that we had the option to leave at any time (after paying the “deposit” for the reservation anyway).

After we decided on our selections, we realized no one had come for a drink order--it must have been at least 5 minutes, possibly more. We set a time limit and decided that if we were ignored for ten full minutes more, we would leave. After another 9 minutes and 50 seconds ( no joke, we had actually started to push back) a waiter came. ""Order?"" (He knew no English), so we tried it out. My wife's order was available, but my selection was not available--""All finished"" (Ok, he knew three words). I settled for a Gorgonzola Pizza. My wife's wine was poured at the table but no taste-to-approve was offered (a first for this trip to Spain!). Also no bread, no olives, nothing to raise the bar above take-out pizza. My wife's lobster ravioli had a distinct fishy/salty flavor but was not recognizable as lobster. The Gorgonzola pizza needed salt to bring out the flavor (think about that for a second to fully understand). All in all the worst dining experience in Spain in a very long time. No less expensive than some other very great meals with real quality service.

The variety of croquettes were a good choice also.  Crispy boar rolls with portabello mushroom sauce and Chicken Breast cubes with spicy cheese were ok, but I wouldn’t choose them again.

We luckily managed to walk in and get a table straight away. But it was still really busy at nine so I’d say booking is probably better to do.  What an adorable place, lovely ambience and friendly staff. The cocktails were delicious.  We ordered five dishes and tried to order the six. The waitress was very kind and told us we probably wouldn’t need more than five dishes and also recommended the best food. Really helpful!  Wow wow the food was amazing and I could not believe how cheap it was compared to other places we have been. The melted cheese, with pesto and tomato jam was to die for. The aubergine wrapped in bacon, tomato and feta sauce was also delicious! Both dishes I had never tried before.  If you are visiting Madrid and seek food tapas, you definitely need to come here!

When you get to the bouncer, he tries to be funny while waiting, and asks questions... to entertain you? Really, I don´t want to be asked where I am from or why I am in Madrid.  The magic moment arrives that you are allowed to get into the place - and get rid of the bouncer and his questions. Ok, drinks are excellent, presentation is beautiful, water is also served with snacks that are often refilled.  In the beginning, there is A LOT of noise; music is loud and people have to scream to each other to be heard. Suddenly they turn up the music volume and from that moment on, it becomes impossible to have a conversation with the people you are with. So you end up looking at what is going on around or your cellphone. There is not a fixed style of music, so it goes from the typical music you hear at street festivals to some old songs.  I expected much more of this "" famous "" place. At least, I expected to have the possibility to talk with the ones I was with without being bombarded with tasteless music at full blast.

As it happens, David, who embodies what a bartender should be by anticipating what a client wants, now works there. I waited in line to go in for about 15 minutes (Madrid is very respectful and strict about complying with fire codes and the maximum persons allowed inside a restaurant or bar) and it was worth it! The service is exceptional (thank you, David, you are the best!!!), the bartenders work hard (I can attest to how hard David and Filippo, another bartender, worked), and the drinks were creative, beautiful works of art and simply delicious! The support staff, like Estefanía, who brought the bill, and another David, who was attentive about providing water and good potato chips to customers, couldn’t have been nicer.

I'm not surprised. Salmon Guru has everything a craft cocktail bar should have but the reason it will top our list is because the people who work there love their jobs. They are friendly, no pretentious attitudes that you can find at craft cocktail bars from time to time. If you are into cocktails, I encourage you to strike up a conversation with the staff.

I've walked by it on so many occasions and never gone in (either in this or in any of its previous incarnations), so one Saturday when one of the workers asked me in to try ""delicious Cuban food"", I decided to take him up on his offer.  The food was delicious. I got a fish dish which came with rice, black beans or frijoles and two other ""extras"". My experience of Cuban food is that it is quite heavy and carb-laden, and this was too. I tried my best to finish it off but it was a challenge, And that's when the word Tiramisú came up. I didn't think Tiramisú was particularly Cuban BUT, the waiter insisted that it was the best Tiramisú I'd try anywhere.  He wasn't lying. It was just amazing.

The food was delicious -- I had the classic chicken steak with black beans and rice (bistec de pollo con arroz y frijoles negros). It was deliciously prepared with a hint of garlic and the beans were amazing. It was so good I went back another time and had it again with the fried tostones instead of rice. The second time was on a Saturday night and the place was packed and the only spot available was at the bar. I had so much fun talking with Julian as he mixed drinks for the other patrons. The mojitos were a big favorite. My friend sitting next to me tried the empanadas de carne and said they were the best he ever had. I had so much fun with the waiters and met the gracious owners Julian and Ariel. Definitely try Borax if you're in Madrid.

Just a few days before the World Best Bars list was revealed and it is on the #47 and now I know why !  Entrance/Access: The Security Staff at the door was very friendly , and usually they are arrogant or sometimes rude , so that was a very good 1st impression .  The place :  I loved the decoration and the vibe like hipster and funky place to have a good cocktail and a snack .  It is not a big place so it could be crowded most of the time .  Drinks and Food : There’s a huge list of cocktails very creative and for everyone, even without alcohol , we took 15minutes to choose one.  The menu it’s very cool , and the presentation of the cocktails are the best !  The food is good but not outstanding.  Service: Very good if we consider that is in Spain because usually the service is bad and the waiters are unfriendly it seems like they don’t care , so very good for Estefanía ( she also recommended good drinks )  We also had a glass of water when we arrive to the table , nice detail !

From the moment we walked into the dimly lit, stylishly decorated dining area, our evening was enjoyable and full of life. We had a group of 10 people, and were able to get two tables by the bar, which came with wonderful service and a beautiful view of the place. The decor was on point, and the cocktail menu had something for every taste bud. I had the Yellow Chili, which was a spicy drink, and was amazed with how delicious my order was. While I am typically not a cocktail drinker, it was wonderful to treat myself to a perfectly balanced, well mixed cocktail. While it might be tough to take a large group here, we managed to pull it off and everyone had a great time. Whether flying solo, on a date, or with friends, definitely check this place out if you're looking for cocktails and a fun evening. The cocktails were typical cocktail price (9-12€).

The bar was buzzing with people and had a great energy. The decor is very punk-rock/hipster/chic and has a nice vibe. We ordered two of their own cocktails and two classic cocktails after going through the extensive menu, which is very well curated. We went around 8pm but I'm sure it gets super busy later in the night. Would highly recommend it for a pre or post dinner drink. The service was great and the drinks, delicious. A waitress did drop an entire plate of drinks beside us, soaking one of my friends, but apart from an apology and some tissues, they didn't do much to help us. The reason I'm not removing a star for this is that I've found the service in Spain to be consistently off-handish and aloof so I assume many of you have had the same experience!",2018-10-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10731641-Reviews-or60-Salmon_Guru-Madrid.html,UID_6619,0.014,0.769,0.216,0.9891,0.3205,0.4847777777777777,0.415025,822,78,0.0948905109489051,1,22,False,40,0.0588235294117647,0.1764705882352941,0.5294117647058824,0.0,0.1764705882352941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0588235294117647,0.0,154,113,4.3441558441558445,0,0,walk bar grab tabl back bar buzz peopl great energi decor punk rock hipster chic nice vibe order two cocktail two classic cocktail go extens menu well curat went around pm sure get super busi later night would highli recommend pre post dinner drink servic great drink delici waitress drop entir plate drink besid us soak one friend apart apolog tissu much help us reason remov star found servic spain consist handish aloof assum mani experi,average review,3

Luckily this place was less than 100m from the door and was the best find of the holiday. This bar is very near to the Plaza Santa Ana and we visited on a Sunday evening around 19.00. The bar isn't huge and luckily we were able to get a seat. An unassuming exterior does not prepare you for inside; quirky decor, cool music and very strong drinks. The menu was all in Spanish but we did a fairly good job of deciphering what was what. The staff were amazing; a constant stream of crisps to snack on and topping up our water glasses from a duck shaped jug. The drinks are fantastic; one of mine was called the flamingo and came in an appropriately shaped mug and was delicious. Loving the atmosphere so much we stayed for 2 drinks each- be warned, they are using the real deal spirits here and the drinks are strong. We could only manage a salad for dinner after our liquid pre- dinner drinks. We were the only tourists here and seemingly the only people who didn't know all the staff on first name terms but they were so welcoming and attentive. We were devastated that we found this place on a Sunday and could only have one visit- they are closed on Mondays. Drinks cost around €10, so about the same price you'd pay in an English city for a cocktail. You can get cheaper drinks in Madrid but I would go back to Madrid just to go here again.
