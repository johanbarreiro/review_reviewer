I enjoyed it so much that I went back again on my last night. The two nights were are a completely different experience so if I go back to Madrid again I'll know how how to do it right. The first time I went, we got seats at the bar and we were in the center of all the action, orders coming in, new people arriving and we had some interaction with the barman. We ordered 4 dishes, all good, they came one at a time so we had some time to chat and take in the atmosphere in between. There was a bit of a delay before the final dish arrived, we didn't mind but our host insisted on giving us some free wine to make up for it. The second night we got a table and again ordered 4 dishes, but this time they all arrived together. The food was still excellent but the night seemed to pass by so much quicker... so next time I'll be looking for a bar stool.

It has many locals in the restaurant and as we all no that's a good sign, Alex greeted us and from then onwards in my opinion is the most happiest, helpful, warmest waiter we have ever come across. He was exceptional and even though the place was full the bloke never even had a drip of sweat on him. He's as cool as a cucumber and worth his weight in gold. The food was amazing!

We greeted our server in our limited Spanish, and he was very happy to converse with us in both English and Spanish. I think he really appreciated our attempts instead of just automatically speaking English.  The food was delicious as expected. Unfortunately they ran out of the salmon brochetas (which he told us happens all the time since they're so popular). Instead, we tried the gambones in garlic and the ropa vieja. Both were delicious and filling for the two of us. We also ordered a sangria and it was sweet and so delicious.

They specialize in Jamon Iberico, and you should always try to eat the house specialty. I cannot more highly recommend the ""Presa."" It is a particular cut of meat that you'll find in certain restaurants. It's actually hard to believe that it is pork because it tastes like a very fine cut of beef (it's very marble-ized). As they grill it, you'll enjoy the extra tastiness of the cooking method. I can't say enough about how exquisite this dish is. We also enjoyed the foie gras with apples tapa. Nice combo. Unfortunately we'd had a massive lunch earlier the day we ate here, so we didn't try too many dishes, but what we had was all terrific. The service was also very good. After a snafu with the credit card, the waiter was gracious and patient (American guests - if you have a credit card like Capital One or AmEx which already does not charge a forex fee, make sure that they select ""Euros"" for your charge, otherwise you'll get stuck paying in dollars and they'll take the 5% forex fee onto your bill.

The restaurant has a lovely vaulted cellar with attentive staff. We only had some pinchos, which were great, but the food that was being delivered to other tables looked really special.

Bearing in mind our bill including wine was only euro 90 we have just had a gastronomic experience that was totally unexpected. We immediately tried to book for the next day but sadly it was full. We will have to see if we can squeeze in lunch or just tapas.  One word of warning the starters of mixed tapas are amazing but huge don't have one each. The mains were a work of art and just so good.

Wife had half wok noodle and I had full gambas for first course and half salmon tempura for second course for both of us. The gambas was incredible: I had 8 and they were in butter and garlic. Just delicious! Noodle wok was very good according to my wife. The salmon itself was good but it was strangely put together. So I just ate the salmon by itself (very good) and the green and red peppers by themselves and left the rest (cheese) there. Not much of an issue since I was already full from my gambas. Service was very good. We went early (for Madrid) at 7PM and it was still warm in the restaurant. When we left at 8:30PM it was much better. Overall a great experience to repeat.

The food, drinks, service, and vibes were all great! I came here with a large group (17 people) and they were very accommodating and set up the back room for us. While we were waiting we had drinks at the bar. They served the most delicious and beautiful sangria- it was full of different fruits (blackberries, pineapple, even kumquats!) and cinnamon sticks. Other people in my group got pina colada's which were also very tasty. Once we sat down, I ordered the prawn risotto and it was the best risotto that I've ever had! Very flavorful. Following dinner, we were treated to free dessert (some of the best cheesecake I've ever had) and free tequila shots (and I'm not talking about that bottom shelf stuff...).

We picked here because it looked so relaxed, and it was. Our waiter, Gustavo, was soooo friendly and helpful. He spoke English very well which made it smooth to order. The food came out timely, the bread was hot and delicious, the wine was local from Madrid and also very good. The only thing that made it less than perfect was the temperature. The day we went it felt like 95° and humid and they had the windows open and no AC. We arrived on the early side (8:30pm, compared to normal dinner time in Spain is 10pm) and noticed when we were close to the end of our meal that they had closed the windows and turned the air on (probably 10pm by this time.) All in all, excellent time. Loved the casual atmosphere &a friendly staff!  PS- We ordered the eggplant, hummus and cheese plate to start. The eggplant was to die for and came with a delicious berry compote. The hummus was super fresh and delicious. For main courses we ordered 1) mushroom risotto which was creamy and the best ever, 2) Cuban shredded flank steak which was delicious and served with chips (had more of an appetizer feel, as it was excellent for sharing), 3) Tuna Tar Tar which was very fresh but also a VERY large portion!, 4) salmon tempura which came with a balsamic honey sauce for dipping and that too was excellent, it was a little dry but I think they asked for it well done, 5) beef tenderloin which was cooked perfectly and served with scalloped potatoes that were very yummy.  Overall, I don't think you can go wrong here! Thank you Taberna Mas Al Sur for such a great experience in Madrid!! ❤️",2017-07-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396325-Reviews-or1130-Taberna_Mas_Al_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_18976,0.031,0.768,0.201,0.9954,0.3665745464852608,0.6112018140589569,0.6036764705882354,1710,150,0.087719298245614,5,51,False,76,0.1666666666666666,0.2333333333333333,0.3166666666666666,0.0166666666666666,0.15,0.0166666666666666,0.0,0.0166666666666666,0.0666666666666666,0.0166666666666666,318,199,4.3742138364779874,0,0,absolut love dinner taberna ma al sur th day spain tire fanci long drawn dinner pick look relax waiter gustavo soooo friendli help spoke english well made smooth order food came time bread hot delici wine local madrid also good thing made less perfect temperatur day went felt like humid window open ac arriv earli side pm compar normal dinner time spain pm notic close end meal close window turn air probabl pm time excel time love casual atmospher friendli staff ps order eggplant hummu chees plate start eggplant die came delici berri compot hummu super fresh delici main cours order mushroom risotto creami best ever cuban shred flank steak delici serv chip appet feel excel share tuna tar tar fresh also larg portion salmon tempura came balsam honey sauc dip excel littl dri think ask well done beef tenderloin cook perfectli serv scallop potato yummi overal think go wrong thank taberna ma al sur great experi madrid,very good review,5

His very unique cooking style with his extraordinary creativity results a perfect dining experience. He is bravely mixing Mediterranean, Asian and South American ingredients into art on the plate.  The dining room is a reflection of his extravagant style. Fancy decor with pink colour dominations, lot of curtains and theatrical elements like flying pigs all over. After the welcome drinks ( Grosset Grand Rose champagne with pink label) the meal started with canopes.  The cantonese chicken, the sheep's milk and maturated salmon croquette and the taco was a very impressive warming up, all were delicious with plenty of flavour. This was followed by some Indian dishes. A very deep flavour vindaloo curry was balanced with greek yoghurt, Dal Makhani & Frog leg prepared like buttered chicken masala, with papadum of lentils. Pan puri filled with New Delhi salmorejo and Joselito's coppa. Very special steamed, light and fluffy naan with truffle and Mumbai flower with pink pepper. The spices were beautifully balanced in all Indian dishes. Than we went to China. Roman style kokotxa was served together with Necora chilli crab and it was followed by one of the most successful dish of the meal, Xialongbao Xo Iberian soup dumpling with aged beef rib & bone marrow. All the elements were precisely flavoured and cooked.  And many, more and more beautiful dishes. Red mullet and smoked eel, The sea urchin we had to eat from our hand. That was followed by and another great dish, suckling pig skin with squids, matured tomatoes, Habanero puree. Idiazabal cheese, frozen green lemon and coriander root. The suckling pig skin was crispy and light, the light sweetness of the matured tomato was in perfect balance with the savoury of the cheese, the sourness of green lemon with coriander and the creamy Habanero pure. This was a terrific dish. Red mullet with Moroccan lemon, smoked chorizo juice and Olluco puree. A lovely dish with rich flavour was carefully balanced. Kagoshima wagyu fillet steak. A high quality, A5 grade , perfectly marbled, very high quality Kobe beef cooked to perfection. His 25 courses menu was a fantastic gastronomic journey around the world. With this wonderful diner we had a wonderful wine, one of my favourite Spanish white wines, a bottle of As Sortes from Rafael palacios’s winery. The presentation was extraordinary, the service was top level, smooth and friendly all the way through the 3,5 hours dining time. I am sure this was not our last visit to this fabulous place.

The bacaloa was rich and creamy. We were too full for dessert, but what we saw at the other tables made us wish we had saved room. The price was very reasonable for the amount of food we ate.

We came from Milano to dine at DiverXO in January 2020. A culinary experience out of this world. Prepare yourselves, go to DiverXO with an open mind and you will for sure appreciate the Chef’s tasting menu. The different courses have the taste of European, Peruvian, Japanese, Indian, Korean, etc… A tour all around the world, just by sitting at the table in this extraordinary restaurant. Upon reservation, we asked for an Italian-speaking waitress/waiter, in order to better understand the explanation for each dish. We were assigned an Italian waitress who guided us through this experience and was very helpful, nice and professional during our 18 courses tasting menu. How to explain the experience at DiverXO? One of a kind. Everything was perfect, form the visit to the wine cellar, to the room kept at 16°C dedicated to the handling of raw ingredients and desserts, to the actual kitchen, with an astonishing number of professionals of the Chef’s team. Like art in a museum, whoever can understand this kind of culinary philosophy will surely remain full of marvel and the dishes are surely incredible, almost moving. All the senses are satisfied during this experience. Thanks again to Chef David Muñoz for taking the time to leave his place in the kitchen to take a picture with us. Just one thing to underline: the wine list is surely well equipped, pages and pages of different wines form all over the world, however we found just one red wine and just one white wine from Italy. That’s a bit thin!

I had a long wait for my train, and I was very glad I made the extra effort to leave the station for the delicious food they served me. Now to the details: The service was quick and very kind. The first order was ready in 7min, and tasted mind blowing. That was the Pintxo de Bacalao. The second came a couple of minutes later, which was the Pintxo de Calamares. Those did not taste as delicious, but the first course set a pretty high standard. The presentation of the food was beautiful (with little dried flowers acting as a garnish and adding a pop of colour). For those two courses, and a tea, the bill came to €14.80. Given the location, service, and quality of the food I thought this was very reasonable, and affordable.  To conclude, the next time I pass through Madrid I will make the effort of eating here again.  P.s. In retrospect I would have rather sat downstairs, where they have low tables, whereas on the ground floor it has much more of a bar feel. I did not notice these existed until too late.

Several of the courses were pretty but were average in taste. In particular the indian inspired early courses while OK were not better than that from an average indian restaurant. Service was also spotty. Many times we needed to try to get a waiters attention to have water or wine refilled. The bill at DiverXO was more than the other 4 restaurants and came no where near the experience. In fact the bill at DiverXO was almost twice that of Terraza Casino because the food and wine were higher priced. The place has a hip feel and is a cool atmosphere but I wouldn't go again.

In these travels we have ate at top 50 restaurants on 6 continents and in all of those travels the lack of care by DiverXO is without question the worst in the world. When we visit restaurants we often find that the food is 1/2 of the experience and the care by their staff is the other 1/2. I feel very confident in saying the service at DiverXO has to be the absolute worst in the world. I don't know if it is because they have had such demand that they no longer care, or if they are just resting on the food and not caring about the customer. We booked a trip to the Madrid and San Sebastian area and secured reservations at 10 different Michelin Stared restaurants for my wife and two of our friends. Three weeks before the trip our friend had to have surgery and was no longer able to attend. We immediately reached out to all 10 restaurants and 9 of the 10 showed amazing customer service. the one exception is DiverXO. They stated we could either cancel or pay for the two extra meals. when I requested to speak with a manager they stated the same thing and were very unhelpful. at one point even saying ""you should have planned better"". How do you plan for an unexpected surgery? This shows an amazing lack of empathy and care about the customer.  Even with me writing this review I am positive they do not care, because they are still sold out. However, if you have a choice of places to visit, in an area with such great food, choose somewhere else that cares about their guests.",2019-11-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19049,0.075,0.773,0.152,0.9833,0.1448564593301435,0.6379186602870813,0.5319466666666667,1563,162,0.1036468330134357,0,27,False,46,0.0983606557377049,0.1475409836065573,0.3442622950819672,0.0491803278688524,0.1475409836065573,0.0163934426229508,0.0,0.0491803278688524,0.0983606557377049,0.0491803278688524,296,168,4.280405405405405,0,0,wife travel world food becam passion travel ate top restaur contin travel lack care diverxo without question worst world visit restaur often find food experi care staff feel confid say servic diverxo absolut worst world know demand longer care rest food care custom book trip madrid san sebastian area secur reserv differ michelin stare restaur wife two friend three week trip friend surgeri longer abl attend immedi reach restaur show amaz custom servic one except diverxo state could either cancel pay two extra meal request speak manag state thing unhelp one point even say plan better plan unexpect surgeri show amaz lack empathi care custom even write review posit care still sold howev choic place visit area great food choos somewher els care guest,very bad review,1

We couldn’t have been happier! Gloria immediately gave us a friendly greeting and seated us. We ordered the sangria de cava which I highly recommend! We started with the blue cheese croquettes which were fantastic and then Gloria recommended we try the pollo croquettes as well. Holy moly those were my favorite!!! Then we decided to share the duck and mushroom paella. It is literally OUT OF THIS WORLD! Since coming to Spain I’ve eaten several different versions of paella and this is the absolute best! We were both full after the paella but once again Gloria recommended a few desserts to try. Well...we are on vacation and walking a lot, right?!?

Some time ago she took me to this restaurant Sabe a Gloria, and we both really enjoyed it. Really tasty food, good prices (menu of the day costed around 11€ a person including one [soft]drink 300cl bottle and dessert) and friendly personnel. Because of this we went back -today- and ordered the 'menu of the day'.  This restaurant is really hidden and without having the address or someone from Valencia taking you here, you will probably never find it (which is a shame). So if you're planning on visiting Bioparc (one of the most impressive Zoo's I've ever visited) or the Parque de Cabecera (free natural park) do yourself a favor and visit this typical Valencian taberna\restaurant and enjoy one of their fine meals.",2014-07-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4225711-Reviews-or90-Sabe_a_Gloria-Madrid.html,UID_19056,0.018,0.796,0.186,0.9811,0.2786458333333333,0.4256410256410256,0.5942999999999999,873,66,0.0756013745704467,0,28,False,40,0.2058823529411764,0.1176470588235294,0.3235294117647059,0.0294117647058823,0.1470588235294117,0.0,0.0294117647058823,0.0294117647058823,0.088235294117647,0.0294117647058823,152,115,4.743421052631579,0,0,thank girlfriend live valencia opportun visit spain regular basi tast spanish cultur one bite time time ago took restaur sabe gloria realli enjoy realli tasti food good price menu day cost around person includ one soft drink cl bottl dessert friendli personnel went back today order menu day restaur realli hidden without address someon valencia take probabl never find shame plan visit bioparc one impress zoo ever visit parqu de cabecera free natur park favor visit typic valencian taberna restaur enjoy one fine meal,good review,4

There are 2 menu options, one more 'adventurous' than the other. The restaurant being the purpose of our visit to Madrid we went for the adventurous option. 19 canvas (courses) officially but with a few of the canvas having several dishes this ended up around the 25 mark and took around 4 and a half hours.  In the thousand and one travels around David's Oniric Works the stand out dishes were the Mexican elements, the monkfish, the Chinese section and all the desserts. The eels weren't to everyone in the party's taste and the prawn bolognese was a challenge after squeezing out the brains onto the dish as a sauce but the flavours were intense and it was a great experience.  No wine flight is available which we actually enjoyed as the focus was solely on the food then and the only disappointing thing was the lack of 'take away' goodies which other 3 stars seem to do. A funky soundtrack of 80s music restyled by The Lost Fingers and a tour of the kitchen before sitting down were nice touches and the restaurant and tablewear as a whole is well done and as weird as you'd expect if you see the promo video on the restaurants website. Price wise this came in at significantly less than the Fat Duck or other 3 stars we've been to which was a nice surprise and represented great value for money I thought.

Once we sat down, and the place was fairly empty, the couple who ran the place continued to welcome locals with hugs and kisses who arrived for dinner. To me a sure sign this place in a tourist locale still has a true local following. The service was homespun for sure but the food was fantastic without trying to be something it was not. Hours were not spent on plating here but what you received were true Spanish dishes with love and care put into each one. I had the vegetarian croquettes with apricot which were astounding in flavor and texture. Followed by barbecue pork ribs which were divine. Not buried in sauce but roasted in a way to allow the pork flavor to come through as it should. These were served with potato with specs of truffle and they were the perfect accompaniment.

First of all, it's within very easy walking distance from many frequently visited sites in Madrid, but its location on the Calle Huertas makes it more quiet and cozy. The locale is attractive and inviting, and everything is pristinely clean: restrooms, dining area, wine ""cellar,"", and (most importantly) the kitchen. The most meaningful aspect of a restaurant, though, is its food, and here is where Sabe a Gloria really stands out. The selection consists mainly of familiar and comforting traditional Spanish foods, all given an exquisite twist. For instance, you may think you like patatas bravas, but unless you've tried Gloria's individual fried fingerling potatoes adorned with piped bravas sauce and ajoaceite, you haven't had the best. All five of us at the table all agreed that, although everything else was excellent, we would all travel to Madrid simply for those patatas bravas alone! One companion ordered the entrecot (ribeye steak), which thrilled all the meat eaters at the table. Another fish lover was impressed with one dish (the name escapes me) broiled in a clay container, of cod and bechamel, which one spreads over bread. The timbal of goat cheese with caramelized slow-roasted vegetables on top was one of my favorites. Of all the many things I have tasted from Gloria's kitchen, I can affirmatively state that every single dish has been of the utmost quality and served with exquisite presentation. Mediocrity of any kind is just not found at Sabe a Gloria. You can, of course, order from a list, but I recommend you go with the menú del día or even just let your server and Gloria pick for you. Also, unless you spot a wine on the list that you absolutely MUST have, allow Julián to make a selection for you. I promise you'll be happy with his selection.

Well Diverxo, did it.  Finally we encounter a restaurant that provides us with a combination of cuisines (Spanish, Japanese, Chinese and Peruvian) and cooking styles that push the boundaries of flavours.  The restaurant was recommended to us by Nuno Mendes, the head chef of Viajante restaurant in London. We decided on the 12 course tasting menu and from the first dish the sparks started flying. The first dish consisted of duck tongue, avocado and cod. Second, frog legs, coconut foam, taro and mountain Japanese caviar. Third tuna belly. Fourth, prawn & shitake mushroom with chicken consommé. Fifth, Japanese bun with mushroom and cecina. Sixth Schrimp carpaccio. Seventh, suckling pig a la Being duck. Seventh part 2, 'Burger'. Eight, monk fish with French purple potato sheets. Tenth, 'stewed' ox & rice paper. Intermezzo of raspberry gum. Eleventh, violet panacotta. And last, white chocolate with celery foam, frozen olives and cucumber jus.  Often you eat a dish in a Michelin restaurant that is good, but not jaw dropping...not the case with Diverxo. Every dish is imaginative, inspired, daring, measured and extremely well executed.  Unfortunately, Diverxo doesn't allow pictures to be taken of the food, but the dining experience more than makes up for it. I would go as far as to say that together with Martin Berasategui and Akelare in San Sebastian, I'd consider Diverxo to be amoung the best in Spain. They deserve a third Michelin star in my book. I can't wait to visit Madrid again and sample some more of their dishes.",2011-06-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or180-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19091,0.022,0.906,0.072,0.9402,0.1208333333333333,0.3608974358974359,0.1950695652173913,1692,101,0.059692671394799,0,65,False,44,0.1568627450980392,0.1372549019607843,0.2941176470588235,0.0392156862745098,0.196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0588235294117647,0.0588235294117647,0.0196078431372549,280,201,5.0321428571428575,0,0,girlfriend eaten quit multi michelin star restaur across world take except restaur us go omg well diverxo final encount restaur provid us combin cuisin spanish japanes chines peruvian cook style push boundari flavour restaur recommend us nuno mend head chef viajant restaur london decid cours tast menu first dish spark start fli first dish consist duck tongu avocado cod second frog leg coconut foam taro mountain japanes caviar third tuna belli fourth prawn shitak mushroom chicken consomm fifth japanes bun mushroom cecina sixth schrimp carpaccio seventh suckl pig la duck seventh part burger eight monk fish french purpl potato sheet tenth stew ox rice paper intermezzo raspberri gum eleventh violet panacotta last white chocol celeri foam frozen oliv cucumb ju often eat dish michelin restaur good jaw drop case diverxo everi dish imagin inspir dare measur extrem well execut unfortun diverxo allow pictur taken food dine experi make would go far say togeth martin berasategui akelar san sebastian consid diverxo amoung best spain deserv third michelin star book wait visit madrid sampl dish,very good review,5

An open mind about food is required, since what is brought to the table pushes the boundaries in many ways. A friend and I got reservations for lunch for one day to the next, and we got one call for confirmation. The dining room was decorated in a black, grey and silver palette, which I found a touch industrial, with Philippe Stark influences. Service was impeccable from the start, with the staff anticipating our needs, responding promptly without being genuflect and explaining the complex dishes. We had the basic 7 course meal of 2 appetizers, 3 dishes and 2 desserts. Since everything is a small portion, this was equivalent to a regular lunch of first, second and dessert. Now, the similarity with anything regular ends there. The quality of ingredients, presentation and flavors were fantastic. Each dish was a beautiful arrangement, an abstract installation of edibles a surprise for the eyes. The flavors matched the looks, original without being bizarre, with very interesting fusion of mediterranean and asian flavors and techniques. I could go on and on, but suffices to say that what we got at Diverxo is exactly what I expect from a high-end restaurant.

It took them 20 minutes to take our order; they kept saying “uno momento” but then focused on other tables (and they weren't that busy). We finally placed our order but another 20 minutes passed before we got their attention to bring us the drinks we had ordered. Then they poured our wine glasses less full than they did for the locals at the table next to us. The Paella Valenciana had more beans than meat and overcooked rice. My Dorado was the whole fish that you had to take care eating because of the bones, but the accompanying orange salad was tasty. The horrible service continued when I had to request 3 different staff members for the check; another 20 minutes. Dinner in Spain can be slow, but service in this place was just plain rude.

Whilst there we ate out every day for lunch and dinner. We had many very nice meals but the food at Sabe a Gloria was the best we had and as a result we ended up eating their twice during our stay. The waiter was very attentive without being over bearing and the service received was first class. Our first meal was the mid-week menu del dia (menu of the day) which was both delicious and very reasonably priced - from memory it was about 10-15Euro pp for a 3 course meal and a cerveza. We went back on our last day and went with the chef's house recommendations for a three course meal which was fantastic traditional Spanish food. We ended up conversing with the chef (through our waiter who acted as a translator) who was a lovely lady. The restaurant itself has been fitted out in an authentic style and had a nice ambience. In summary we cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.,2018-05-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4225711-Reviews-or50-Sabe_a_Gloria-Madrid.html,UID_19104,0.013,0.858,0.129,0.9799,0.3110526315789473,0.5770175438596491,0.3929625,976,93,0.0952868852459016,0,20,False,48,0.1379310344827586,0.1724137931034483,0.3448275862068966,0.0344827586206896,0.2413793103448276,0.0,0.0,0.0344827586206896,0.0,0.0344827586206896,184,121,4.309782608695652,0,0,father went madrid long weekend thur mon watch real game whilst ate everi day lunch dinner mani nice meal food sabe gloria best result end eat twice stay waiter attent without bear servic receiv first class first meal mid week menu del dia menu day delici reason price memori euro pp cours meal cerveza went back last day went chef hous recommend three cours meal fantast tradit spanish food end convers chef waiter act translat love ladi restaur fit authent style nice ambienc summari cannot recommend restaur highli enough,good review,4

Think of Alice in Wonderland. Nothing comes closer to that as Diverxo. Some have catalogued David Muñoz as the Dalí of high cuisine. To me, he's become the ultimate Quijote. I had been attempting to get a table at Diverxo for the past three years. Not been able to determine with enough anticipation the time of my next visit to Madrid prevented me from booking sufficiently in advance. Fortunately, however, Diverxo's reservation system provides the option of waitlising. And I just happened ro chose that for a lunch spot during the second shift. Given our high expectations, and the wonderful ambiance (the staff certainly makes you feel you are living your own fantasy) we opted for the 18 course menu. I can't describe the experience. There are no words that can prepare you for what you are going to experience. So, being a regular contributor to TripAdvisor, this would be the first time I decide not to list or describe the dishes - or should I say gifts - we were presented with.

I was immediately intrigued by all the the reviews I read online.  Unfortunately I found that the restaurant was fully booked and there was quite a waiting line. After a cancellation I was lucky enough to still be allowed in. We started our evening with a tour of the restaurant. It is amazing to see how this restaurant functions. As we were the first ones in, all tables were still surrounded by drapes and it looked very magical. The pigs and other decoration everywhere just add to this feeling.  We were seated and immediately served an aperitif and handed the menu (see picture) the waiter advised us, as it was our first time at Diverxo, to opt for the smaller one. The sommelier also suggested a white wine or champagne to pair with the menu and we opted for the latter.  The first 3 dishes, the Mexican canvas, were delicious and with our table still surrounded by drapes with eyes coming from Alice in Wonderland had a very cozy feeling.  The music playing in the background (classic song covers in a laid back jazzy mix) added to the whole Diverxo experience. Wonderful, but different. Upon receiving the second dish the drapes were removed and revealed the rest of the restaurant. It was amazing to see the whole restaurant running as a machine. All guests were seemingly having an amazing time. The waiters explain the dishes, tell you what is different about the dish in Diverxo and how to eat it. (With your hands, with a tail-like spoon, with chopsticks, ...). My girlfriend and myself couldn’t stop laughing. In total we enjoyed 15 dishes whereof the last 5 were dessert (the big menu is 23 dishes). We were more than full and I am glad we took the waiter her advise on choosing the smaller menu. There was not a single dish that we didn’t like. Personally I loved all of them. At the end of the evening the bill came down to 500€ total (120 of which we already paid as a booking confirmation). The menu itself was 195€ per person. The bottle of champagne was 90€ and the aperitifs and coffees were 20€ total. Obviously this is quite expensive but given the experience in the restaurant I found it well worth the price. Whilst it will not be in the near future I do see myself coming back for the larger menu. I’d like to thank ALL the people (and there were many) whom served us, laughed together with us and made our visit an experience not to be forgotten. And of course special thanks to the chef and his kitchen team for his great ideas and wonderful dishes.",2017-07-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or40-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19111,0.008,0.824,0.167,0.9978,0.2203739316239316,0.5026480463980463,0.3537931034482758,2583,227,0.0878823073945025,0,57,False,98,0.1318681318681318,0.1648351648351648,0.2857142857142857,0.0769230769230769,0.1538461538461538,0.0219780219780219,0.0329670329670329,0.0329670329670329,0.0549450549450549,0.0439560439560439,467,261,4.524625267665953,0,0,read diverxo restaur whilst search celebr special occas madrid immedi intrigu review read onlin unfortun found restaur fulli book quit wait line cancel lucki enough still allow start even tour restaur amaz see restaur function first one tabl still surround drape look magic pig decor everywher add feel seat immedi serv aperitif hand menu see pictur waiter advis us first time diverxo opt smaller one sommeli also suggest white wine champagn pair menu opt latter first dish mexican canva delici tabl still surround drape eye come alic wonderland cozi feel music play background classic song cover laid back jazzi mix ad whole diverxo experi wonder differ upon receiv second dish drape remov reveal rest restaur amaz see whole restaur run machin guest seemingli amaz time waiter explain dish tell differ dish diverxo eat hand tail like spoon chopstick girlfriend stop laugh total enjoy dish whereof last dessert big menu dish full glad took waiter advis choos smaller menu singl dish like person love end even bill came total alreadi paid book confirm menu per person bottl champagn aperitif coffe total obvious quit expens given experi restaur found well worth price whilst near futur see come back larger menu like thank peopl mani serv us laugh togeth us made visit experi forgotten cours special thank chef kitchen team great idea wonder dish,very good review,5

The vibe in the restaurant is good, not too formal. The price of the menu is 225 euros. That is a normal price for a restaurant from this category.  Three remarks: 1) as only one of us was Spanish, we asked for explanations in English. Unfortunately, the English of some waiters was very hard to understand. And also the explanations were not always accurate. We heard in other tables (in Spanish) more detailed explanations. One time this really went wrong. In one of the last dishes was a crab shell, covered with mousse. The waiter told me to eat it with the hand, but did not tell me that I should not eat the outside. As it was completely covered, I did not realize the crab shell was not eatable. I found out too late. And instead of apologizing, the waiters were just laughing.  2) We ordered wine by the glass. And what happened was the same as we experienced in other Michelin star restaurants: the sommelier was not longer interested in us. That is a shame. We had four glasses (of 12 euro each) of wine, but we dit not get any explanation about the wine. They did not even show us the etiquette of the wine. Also, the glasses were extremely small. Just two fingers of wine. Disappointing 3) There were mistakes in the bill. They added two bottles of wine that we did not order. Luckily, I was sharp enough to realize this. But I can imagine that guests that are a little tipsy don`t check well their bill and pay too much. This should not happen in a restaurant with 3 stars. Overall, - except for the small remarks -, we were very satisfied.

I've been lucky to visit several Michelin star restaurants and this is probably in my top three, which is a super top consideration. The great thing about Diverxo is the ability to surprise: from the taste exploration to the storytelling, passing through decoration and the waiters dresscode. I loved their freshness and coolness and the way they approached customers, that was a little different to what you expect in this kind of restaurants (friendly, close and with a touch of craziness). Food is a constant exploration and it travels continuously to Asia and to exotic gastronomies.

I'm a fan of tasting menus witb over 20 courses; so this place gets extra points for that. The meal was super good, outstanding in fact. However, it didn't necessarily blew my mind (which was what I was expecting). I concluded was that this was because the flavor profile isn't one I like a lot. Super inventive dishes though I think sometimes vulgar. But it's worth mentioning that each and every dish I think were the most harmonious I've ever tried. Meaning the dish as a whole worked perfectly and to my liking rather than trying each ingredient individually. That's why even though it might've not been my flavor profile they managed to convince me. Conclusion had it been flavors more fitting my palate this would've been a perfect 10 of a meal and quite possibly one of my best meals ever.

It does take several months to obtain a reservation but the food is simply devine. Dabiz's creativity and interpretation on ultra modern cuisine truly radiates in his creations. It blows all other Madrid Michelin restaurant out of the water.  Why the average rating? We expected a very edgy atmosphere and unique dining experience - which indeed it was. What we did not expect, was such poor service.  Impressed they offered a choice of languages to have the service in, we opted for English. While my partner is Spanish, I didn't want him to translate throughout the entire meal. We were both there to enjoy. However, during the first and second dish the server didn't speak English. After reminding the host we would like the service in English and after the 4th dish, they were finally able to assign a server to communicate to us. Why offer English if you don't have someone readily available? As each of the dishes were set up and presented, each was a unique setting, we felt like the staff was hurried as they literally threw down the cutlery and place settings at us. As the uniforms were reminiscent of an Oompa Loompa could the scurried service possibly part of the theatrics? At a price tag of over 550 euros for two people, the service should be aligned with the food quality.  Despite the service, I would go back after some time has lapsed and hopefully the staff have been refreshed or have refined their manners.

This place is not just a wonderful ""maison de bouche"" but a real earthquake. We were told and have read so many things about the Chef Dabiz Munoz that we wonder if he was real... And the fact is that He is real and much more crazy and innovative than expected. This moment was not only a meal but an extraordinary experience. Some could say that it is too much but everything is perfectly organized, done, inspired and imagined. Of course, you definitely need to love pork and you do have to know perfectly the spanish wines if you want to appreciate everything but it is a true journey. Don't forget to be very hungry also and to have time... As this was our very first time there, we were proposed the ""little menu El Xow"" about 2 and 1/2 hours but there is also ""the full El Xef"" menu which is 3 and 1/2 hours... It is so difficult to explain what we felt but the best way I could describe is that I only understood completely the presenting video from the website after that experience and the video reflect exactly the sensations...

I am always excited to try excellent cuisine, and have good service. I went for a business dinner, arranged by a colleague. Not knowing much about the restaurant I tried to go with an open mind to be surprised. The decor of the place if fantastic, especially the exterior garden looks like it would be wonderful to enjoy a drink before dinner. The service was in general polite with a few off moments, however timings were off and a sense of actually caring about serving and your customer - and not just going through the motions was certainly perceived... (If you want excellent service in Madrid try Santceloni) Everything was quite correct as we came in, we were taken to the table offered water and a drink. It took a while for the menu to come, and when it did we literally had 1 minute before we were interrupted by the first appetizer. As soon as we completed the appetizer the Chef came to ask if we had found something we liked on the menu, to which we said we had not had time to look at the menu, he then aggressively suggested a tasting menu on us, which we accepted. I must say usually I do go for the tasting menus at fine dining restaurants however the way it came about was not comfortable, and almost no hint of what would be served was given. Of course right after came the sommelier to ask us if we wanted some wine, to which again we told him we had no idea what we would be getting for food, to which he told us well a good wine will do very well... again we were left a bit dumbfounded. Thankfully my colleague knows wines quite well, once we decided to go for a white we consulted with the sommelier and he advised our choice would go very well with the dinner. The wine was excellent it was Emilio Rojo Ribeiro 2016. We did mention to him that as he mentioned our last dish was meat, we would likely love a glass of red with the meat dish, this of course was never offered. The food was good in terms of taste/quality etc - but I can easily think of 5 restaurants in Madrid that are much better. The food lacked (with the exception of 3 small dishes) provocation - most plates left me indifferent (go back to the first quote).  Example they had a dish with Carabineros, which were in terms of quality and tenderness amazing, but no taste. The seasonal tomato dish, a small sort of bag of small shrimp and the mexican dessert were the only dishes to really astonish (for the amount of food we ate, this is not enough). to accompany our dessert we had a wonderful sweet merlot wine recommended by the sommelier. Unfortunately other than the previously stated mexican dessert on the sampling plate, the rest of the dessert left us with a disappointing sensation.

But I ended up getting very sick during the launch having to go to the bathroom twice. So either scallops were mixed into a dish or one of the other shellfish they served me was stored commingled with scallops. Or something else very strange happened... I don’t know.  And the other is that I thought a glass of cava that was included in the weekday lunch menu. They ended up charging me extra for it, but at that point I was too sick to fight it and simply wanted to pay and leave.  Finally, a minor point. A dined solo and it felt strange. I’ve done this in many places but here I felt as if I was constantly being watched.  That being said, the presentation and service were great. The flavors of the dishes were hit and miss for me.

Our meal took a little over three hours but I didn't want it to end. Ramon came out to take our initial order but I only think that was because it was early and he was walking around.

Though eye-wateringly expensive it's actually good value as there was so much work put into each and every offering. We arrived on bicycles which was a little unsettling for the door staff at the hotel but they got used to it and found a home for them ! A couple of tiny little grumbles - first; the staff rattled off the dishes' explanations a bit fast and seemed unwilling to elaborate - we had two serious enquiring questions for information on some of the ingredients but no responses received, and the team seemed a bit ""too"" choreographed and need to relax a bit. Secondly - and come on - why two changes of napery ? - that's just needless and doesn't impress.

To be fair however, there is a 25 course experience, but most diners, us included, opted for the 20 ""moments"". We added the wine pairing too. The service was attentive but not hovering or fawning. The staff were happy to engage with us informally but clearly they are focused on precise service of the moments, landing the plates synchronously with their explanations. The tastes, textures, and marvelous ""chemistry"" was amazing throughout. (Menu and almost all dishes captures in photos.) Even with the slow pace, I began to realize partway through the meal that I simply couldn't finish every dish or every class of wine; there was just too much. I have no regrets about this at all; in fact, I think it's fantastic to be able to eat and taste as much as you like compares to many high end restaurants whose portions are more art than food. No shortage of art here, and you'll be satisfied too.

Upon arriving at the restaurant, we sat down and an extremely rude man began to speak in an altered tone of voice with us when we pointed out that one of the people does not eat meat, as comunicated by e-mail. He said, ''WE DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER MENU! IF YOU WANT TO EAT, THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE'', and continue to speak with contempt. Well, this gentleman passed the image we had the whole night of the restaurant, of an unprepared team that does not know how to adapt to the client. So on, the employees came multiple times to discribe the meatless dishes and were like ''for you, the dish is x because you.... you know...'' looking at me with a horrible face. To complete the experience, there was a HAIR inside one of the dishes of the meatless menu. WHAT?? A HAIR? DISGUSTING. We were completly disappointed and surprised, and when we tried to communicate to the worker Maria what happened, she said it was because ""we are from South America and in Spain people are colder"" and because ''the chef does works if meat so they were not able to prepare any meatless menu''. Unbelievable. For us, this kind of response shows lack of preparation, since we warned TWO WEEKS BEFORE, and the restaurant had the courage to serve a cheese platter as a tasting menu, I DO EAT FISH AND SEA FOOD, and you do serve a CHEESE PLATTER? REALLY? What a shame! We've been to an enormous amount Michelin-starred restaurants in the US, Switzerland, France, England, Portugal, Brazil, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and we were NEVER EVER been so mistreated like this. We lived for 2 years in Switzerland, so this excuse ''the Spanish are cold '', to justify a very rude employee, does not work for us. And the other excuse ''we don't do meatless menus'' it's even worst, because WE SEND AN E-MAIL ASKING IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE, AND THE ANSWER WAS YES. So incredibly disappointing.  I've A SORT OF SICKNESS and I'm UNABLE TO EAT MEAT, it is not a wish out of my mind. The food was just OK, nothing else, and we were not able to enjoy it because the service was disgraceful.

Then we shared the nocciola for dessert.  It was a thoroughly amazing meal, one of the best I've ever had. The restaurant itself is quaint and this makes for a perfect romantic meal.

We did not go inside at all, but they had a nice outdoor seating area where we were quickly greeted by our waiter, Miguel. He brought us warm, delicious bread to start and made some recommendations for the rest of the menu. On his recommendation we started with the assorted appetizer of cured meats, which was delicious. Apparently their specialty is meat, but we were in the mood for paella so we ordered that instead. The menu made a note that it would be about a 40 minute wait which we were fine with, but they even brought us some additional small plates of veggies to share while we waited, which was unexpected, but appreciated. The paella came out and Miguel did a beautiful job of plating it tableside for us, and everything was delicious! For dessert we ordered the passion fruit soup which was refreshing and tasty, and the chocolate mousse. We also ordered a coffee with brandy and Miguel came out again and made a lovely presentation of warming the brandy by pouring hot water into one glass and using another to steam it, which I had never seen before, but made for an entertaining aspect of our dinner. Overall, I would definitely recommend La Mi Venta, and our waiter, Miguel, was extremely helpful with recommendations and his English was excellent.",2018-07-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or310-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_19196,0.005,0.762,0.233,0.9972,0.3988636363636363,0.6628787878787878,0.3820444444444444,1390,124,0.0892086330935251,1,26,False,57,0.1694915254237288,0.2033898305084746,0.3389830508474576,0.0338983050847457,0.1186440677966101,0.0169491525423728,0.0,0.0169491525423728,0.0847457627118644,0.0169491525423728,248,153,4.608870967741935,0,0,arriv madrid first time around dinner time stop la mi venta close hotel go insid nice outdoor seat area quickli greet waiter miguel brought us warm delici bread start made recommend rest menu recommend start assort appet cure meat delici appar specialti meat mood paella order instead menu made note would minut wait fine even brought us addit small plate veggi share wait unexpect appreci paella came miguel beauti job plate tablesid us everyth delici dessert order passion fruit soup refresh tasti chocol mouss also order coffe brandi miguel came made love present warm brandi pour hot water one glass use anoth steam never seen made entertain aspect dinner overal would definit recommend la mi venta waiter miguel extrem help recommend english excel,very good review,5

We thought the food was a little over-tricksy, and that the combinations sometimes had more to do with theatre than flavour. For the most part the wine pairings worked well. When they did not, it was because the combinations on the plate were somewhat inharmonious, making it near impossible to find one wine to suit everything. Although the room was very well decorated, it seemed to lack atmosphere; I really can't put my finger on ""why?"". The staff were very helpful and professional.  Overall, for us, the meal did not come up to the standard we had expected, both from the restaurant's 2 stars and from the TA reviews. It was very good, but not great.

The restaurant is off the normal tourist track but worth the detour. Deceptively small from the outside the interior is fresh, modern, classic and comfortable. We sat at the bar for a glass (read bottle) of wine and were offered a number of tapas to try in succession - little sausage and green pepper burgers, a soup which we believe was cocidado stock, a confit potato tortilla - all of which enhanced our appetites for lunch proper. So lunch - smoked sardines on a bed of courgette and tomato with fennel oil. Bacalao - baked salt cod onions and potato. White tuna salad. And the house speciality - baked cream. Try as we do - and we've been discussing this since we finished - we cannot rate one of these dishes over the other. They were all superb and by far some of the best we've had since we arrived, which is saying something. The staff too were welcoming and friendly and we could not have felt more at home. Our Spanish is limited so special mention for the chef's daughter who kindly translated our praises to the chef (Gloria). The name of the restaurant I think means 'taste of heaven' and without a doubt it certainty is. This restaurant deserves attention. We loved it and you would too.

It was a pleasant surprise - high quality tapas (the beef jerky/jamon was fantastic and the sardines one, over a bed of tomatoes and zucchini, drenched in flavourful olive oil and fragrant peppercorns). It was so simple. The people are very friendly and courteous. But the highlight of the meal was the arroz marinera (not sure of the name but it’s the seafood one - the other one has duck in it).

Despite other reviews here, service was excellent from the small fleet of olive jacketed, blue trousered young waiters.  Lunch turned out to be some seven or so courses of which the two highlights were the tomatoes and the meat courses. Sublime. But others didn't work quite so well, with mixtures of flavours where one was too delicate to balance the strength of the other. For this money i expect to have my socks blown off, and when i left they were still on.  For guidance, the tasting menus seem the way to go; a la carte will probably cost you more for less. The wine list is good and modestly priced as is common in Spain - we had an excellent albariño recommended by the sommelier for 25 euros. Expect to get out for 100-150 euros a head, depending on how bonkers you want to go. Unmissable? No. But certainly among Madrid's finer establishments.",2012-05-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or260-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19214,0.0,0.844,0.156,0.9814,0.1698809523809524,0.5144047619047619,0.4200000000000001,992,82,0.0826612903225806,0,24,False,28,0.131578947368421,0.1578947368421052,0.2894736842105263,0.1052631578947368,0.2105263157894736,0.0263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0526315789473684,0.0263157894736842,178,137,4.567415730337078,0,0,opt euro tast menu small restaur design ambiti larg success mixtur old modern despit review servic excel small fleet oliv jacket blue trouser young waiter lunch turn seven cours two highlight tomato meat cours sublim other work quit well mixtur flavour one delic balanc strength money expect sock blown left still guidanc tast menu seem way go la cart probabl cost less wine list good modestli price common spain excel albari recommend sommeli euro expect get euro head depend bonker want go unmiss certainli among madrid finer establish,good review,4

Our reservation wasn't until 7:30 but we gave it a shot and asked the owner if we can sit down, have a drink and rest a bit until our reservation. He said no problem! The owner couldn't have been more gracious and hospitable. It was my wife's birthday and he didn't forget.  We had a few cold ones, took some pictures, then proceeded downstairs to my requested dining area. We had the male waiter who was fine... until the main course.  We went with all his recommendations. For myself he recommended the meats and I mistakenly ordered a T Bone steak for 46.30 Euros. He highly recommended it. When it arrived (look at picture) it was bloody red. I ordered medium. It came back a second time and it was still too rare. I asked if he can make it medium. I then heard him mumble something inappropriate. Clearly noticeable and unprofessional. It was really too bad because the night was perfect so far. The 3rd time it came back very well done; quite purposely I'm sure.  To an extent, this ruined what would have been a perfect dining experience. They brought out a nice birthday desert and after-dinner drinks which was nice, and the waiter gave himself a nice 20% tip (first and only time that happened during 12 days in Portugal and Spain), and that was that.  With all this said, I want to thank the owner for his gracious hospitality. It is truly a lovely restaurant.",2018-09-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or300-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_19215,0.069,0.72,0.211,0.9931,0.1580286738351254,0.5575627240143369,0.2821761904761904,1453,136,0.0935994494150034,1,46,False,57,0.1176470588235294,0.0735294117647058,0.1617647058823529,0.0588235294117647,0.0441176470588235,0.088235294117647,0.0735294117647058,0.088235294117647,0.1617647058823529,0.1323529411764706,264,174,4.492424242424242,0,0,amaz day sightse degre heat done exhaust reserv gave shot ask owner sit drink rest bit reserv said problem owner graciou hospit wife birthday forget cold one took pictur proceed downstair request dine area male waiter fine main cours went recommend recommend meat mistakenli order bone steak euro highli recommend arriv look pictur bloodi red order medium came back second time still rare ask make medium heard mumbl someth inappropri clearli notic unprofession realli bad night perfect far rd time came back well done quit purpos sure extent ruin would perfect dine experi brought nice birthday desert dinner drink nice waiter gave nice tip first time happen day portug spain said want thank owner graciou hospit truli love restaur,good review,4

We wanted to try several small dishes tapas style but felt that we were limited by price which is a horrible feeling (we are not tight but just felt ripped off).

This place bills itself as an experience and it is. The flavors are orchestrated into a dance to stimulate every part of the palate.  We just came from Berlin where we had a truly great meal at Fischers Fritz (see my review.) The food at Fritz was flawless and created a great meal. Ramon Freixa is in a different realm from this. This is not about a flawlessly executed meal, which it is, but creating an art form of tasting surprise. With Fritz we could recognize everything before we ate it, here each bite was a discovery and a surprise. Nothing could be inferred from the shape or size, nothing hinted as to what was inside.  We chose the Experience Menu which was the medium size meal for 80Euro. Often the amuse bouche can be the most inventive flavorful part of the meal. Not the case here. Although the bread was outrageous and the silver foil wrapped foie de sardine was one flavor after another in one bite, there was much much more to come. Both in the presentation, small pieces of flat black pottery as part of the theme, and the multitude of small dishes the chef pays homage to the high art of Japanese Kaiseki. Spring mushrooms in a form that resembles a piece of a sushi roll for example, but tastes nothing like what it looks like, with a completely new and fresh palate. Only the tiny drop of wasabi as one of seven different flavored drops accompanying the fish tartare appetizer, hinted of Japan.  The wine paring of 40Euro brought six different glasses of wine, each perfectly paired with the course. Each glass complementing both the food and adding to the previous wine. We ordered The Experience and we recieved it beyond what we could have imagined. If you have the time for a full show it is well worth the price.",2013-06-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or250-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19225,0.028,0.832,0.139,0.9926,0.2195212121212121,0.5787818181818182,0.420235,1894,168,0.0887011615628299,0,34,False,62,0.074074074074074,0.1666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0925925925925925,0.0925925925925925,0.0,0.0,0.0555555555555555,0.1111111111111111,0.074074074074074,348,209,4.436781609195402,0,0,michelin two star miss look pinnacl refin flavor place go eat rather tast place bill experi flavor orchestr danc stimul everi part palat came berlin truli great meal fischer fritz see review food fritz flawless creat great meal ramon freixa differ realm flawlessli execut meal creat art form tast surpris fritz could recogn everyth ate bite discoveri surpris noth could infer shape size noth hint insid chose experi menu medium size meal euro often amus bouch invent flavor part meal case although bread outrag silver foil wrap foie de sardin one flavor anoth one bite much much come present small piec flat black potteri part theme multitud small dish chef pay homag high art japanes kaiseki spring mushroom form resembl piec sushi roll exampl tast noth like look like complet new fresh palat tini drop wasabi one seven differ flavor drop accompani fish tartar appet hint japan wine pare euro brought six differ glass wine perfectli pair cours glass complement food ad previou wine order experi reciev beyond could imagin time full show well worth price,very good review,5

The table for 2 was huge but that added to the sense of theatre. The chef did come and take our order. when we told him we had tickets for Real Madrid he recommended we take the menu but one dish less than the experience. It was nice to meet the chef and he did ask if there was anything we didn't like. My wife felt adventurous and said she'd eat most things but when the shellfish starter came I got most of it! You cannot fault the cooking or the ingredients and some of the flavour explosions were quite amazing the way they developed in the mouth, but it just didn't do it for me. I can totally see why it would get 5 stars but for me not knowing what I was getting and then not being totally happy with what I received left me slightly underwhelmed. As I said there were some true highlights but there were also some courses which we couldn't quite work out, i.e. where was the flavour connection between the dishes (each course is split into 3 elements for the diner). It seems almost unfair to give 3 stars especially as the service was also very nice and the accompanying wines well chosen, but it was very expensive and I guess I expected more; although for execution of the ingredients it cannot be faulted I was more often questioning why more than enjoying the combinations.",2013-04-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or250-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19227,0.042,0.813,0.145,0.9839,0.2775595238095237,0.606309523809524,0.3993818181818182,1419,144,0.1014799154334038,1,23,False,48,0.0833333333333333,0.1388888888888889,0.3055555555555556,0.0555555555555555,0.1111111111111111,0.0555555555555555,0.0277777777777777,0.0277777777777777,0.1111111111111111,0.0833333333333333,265,163,4.3584905660377355,0,0,firstli restaur beauti space gorgeou day room well lit natur intern tabl huge ad sens theatr chef come take order told ticket real madrid recommend take menu one dish less experi nice meet chef ask anyth like wife felt adventur said eat thing shellfish starter came got cannot fault cook ingredi flavour explos quit amaz way develop mouth total see would get star know get total happi receiv left slightli underwhelm said true highlight also cours quit work e flavour connect dish cours split element diner seem almost unfair give star especi servic also nice accompani wine well chosen expens guess expect although execut ingredi cannot fault often question enjoy combin,average review,3

Against my wife's request I opted for the Diverxo 1 tasting menu rather than the tasting menu that was a little smaller. Diverxo 1 was the 3rd largest of the 4 tasting menus offered. I didn't know what to expect since the restaurant combines chinese and spanish cuisine. There were a few items that were too extreme for my wife so I had to eat them (ie hot and sour soup w special noodles - baby eels, fried duck tongues, and squid heads with strawberries). The best bites were some type of oxtail pastry type thing topped with baby eels which was the first course, won ton/dumpling with a cracker, and ox which came as a thick narrow strip steak. I could also eat those fried duck tongues by the bag. So good. Monkfish was also very rich and good. Our reservation was at 10 and we weren't out of there until after 1. If I had to do it over again I would get the 2nd option tasting menu. The 3rd was just way too much food. I can't imagine the Chef David tasting menu which is the 4th option. Service was great and it was real nice talking to the wife of the chef (owner). Just a very good, very rich meal and one that I won't be forgetting anytime soon.",2012-06-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or160-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_4516,0.006,0.814,0.179,0.9951,0.2548015873015873,0.5003615520282185,0.2991214285714286,1240,117,0.0943548387096774,0,32,False,43,0.12,0.18,0.34,0.1,0.16,0.02,0.02,0.0,0.04,0.02,242,157,4.128099173553719,0,0,favorit meal trip probabl top meal time wife request opt diverxo tast menu rather tast menu littl smaller diverxo rd largest tast menu offer know expect sinc restaur combin chines spanish cuisin item extrem wife eat ie hot sour soup w special noodl babi eel fri duck tongu squid head strawberri best bite type oxtail pastri type thing top babi eel first cours ton dumpl cracker ox came thick narrow strip steak could also eat fri duck tongu bag good monkfish also rich good reserv would get nd option tast menu rd way much food imagin chef david tast menu th option servic great real nice talk wife chef owner good rich meal one forget anytim soon,very good review,5

I unfortunately think my expectations were too high. I would give this a 3.5 stars if I could. The concept in the decor and menu were a bit strange. On the tables, were metal contraptions with words that were describing the food. The menu was something that seemed more like modern poetry - but not something that would be understood by the average person. Our meal started out well with some excellent starters. The plates were flavorful, beautiful and highly inventive. As the meal progressed though, the service really started to wane - our server was having a difficult time explaining some of the courses which left us trying to figure out what we were eating. We actually had to have the manager come over to explain a dish again. When they poured water for us, they splashed it all over the table and didn't seem to notice. Doing this with water was one thing, but then when they did it with the wine as well that was just not right. The servers seemed inexperienced. At a restaurant of this caliber, we just expected better. The main courses were not very memorable. The desserts were beautiful and good but not great. We had been to El Club Allard a few nights prior to coming to Diverxo which was just a much better meal all around. I would recommend Diverxo since I think that the food is quite good and inventive, but the service and overall experience was not what we would have expected from a 2 Michelin star restaurant.",2012-06-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or160-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19234,0.034,0.835,0.131,0.9875,0.1697167277167277,0.5159426129426129,0.3436352941176471,1570,148,0.0942675159235668,0,30,False,63,0.15,0.2,0.3,0.0666666666666666,0.1833333333333333,0.0166666666666666,0.0,0.0166666666666666,0.05,0.0166666666666666,282,163,4.570921985815603,0,0,made reserv diverxo friend birthday realli look forward tri michelin star restaur unfortun think expect high would give star could concept decor menu bit strang tabl metal contrapt word describ food menu someth seem like modern poetri someth would understood averag person meal start well excel starter plate flavor beauti highli invent meal progress though servic realli start wane server difficult time explain cours left us tri figur eat actual manag come explain dish pour water us splash tabl seem notic water one thing wine well right server seem inexperienc restaur calib expect better main cours memor dessert beauti good great el club allard night prior come diverxo much better meal around would recommend diverxo sinc think food quit good invent servic overal experi would expect michelin star restaur,average review,3

Obviously this was a splurge, but we felt it was worth it. The presentation of each dish was unique and highly choreographed to go with the texture and type of course, and we were blown away by some of the items (truffle-oil dim sum with ox meat, rib meat raviolli with tamarind foam...crazy good), and impressed with all of them. The only issue we had was that we experienced some negative service due to (we think) 2 things. First, though we're in our mid/late 20's, we look younger and often feel that we don't always get the best service based on that, which is unfortunate, but we usually don't feel like there's much recourse other than in the size of the tip we give (try to be generous anyway though most of the time!). The other issue was that we didn't order anything to drink. Given that this was a very big, once in a lifetime sort of experience, we didn't want to have the wrong kind of wine or drink that might muddy the taste of the incredible dishes. We were there for the food and while we do enjoy wine with dinner on occasion, we didn't feel that it was necessary in this instance, and in fact, that it might take away from the food. I think that the combination of our age, our choice not to order a drink, (and the VIP-looking group that was sharing our waiter), led to patchy service. We literally sat there for 30 min. after being given an appetizer of edamame, but we hadn't seen a menu or anything. I was disappointed in this, but once we actually got served, they were polite and accomodating. Anyway, definitely worth a visit, the food alone is worth the price!",2012-04-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or160-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19236,0.069,0.824,0.107,0.9463,0.188560606060606,0.5210606060606063,0.6158538461538462,1742,171,0.0981630309988518,2,62,False,66,0.0517241379310344,0.1379310344827586,0.3103448275862069,0.0689655172413793,0.1724137931034483,0.0344827586206896,0.0344827586206896,0.0172413793103448,0.1034482758620689,0.0689655172413793,325,195,4.363076923076923,0,0,husband wonder meal diverxo last week madrid trip cours addit littl tip obvious splurg felt worth present dish uniqu highli choreograph go textur type cours blown away item truffl oil dim sum ox meat rib meat raviolli tamarind foam crazi good impress issu experienc neg servic due think thing first though mid late look younger often feel alway get best servic base unfortun usual feel like much recours size tip give tri gener anyway though time issu order anyth drink given big lifetim sort experi want wrong kind wine drink might muddi tast incred dish food enjoy wine dinner occas feel necessari instanc fact might take away food think combin age choic order drink vip look group share waiter led patchi servic liter sat min given appet edamam seen menu anyth disappoint actual got serv polit accomod anyway definit worth visit food alon worth price,very good review,5

Inside, the restaurant is beautifully designed with a very laid-back and calm ambience, reflected in the staff's attentive and discreet service. Chef Freixa makes food that I would characterize as restrained and elegant - most plates are an interplay between subtle flavours complementing each other, not the big bold stuff you'll find in some other prominent restaurants. Basically, every single plate worked well out of 25, which is quite impressive - and the concept allows for some genuinely surprising combinations, like the one where you have beef, mortadella, nectarine, truffle, sea urchin and blackberry all on one plate, and it tastes beautifully.

Situated on a quiet street in the Hotel Unico in Salamanca, the restaurant has a lovely setting and an attentive yet unobtrusive staff. Well priced and varied wine list with an excellent young sommelier. We chose to have one of the several prix fixe options and we already were served an amuse bouche and a selection of innovative ""snacks"" before our first appetizer appeared. Peas, asparagus and cod were followed by a scallop with artichokes along with a bone marrow flan and aloe vera with umami. Roasted garlic-onion pudding and amazing white beans with sausage were another highlight. Main courses of delightful servings of perfectly prepared fish and beef cheek.

They carefully explained each dish, and which order to eat them in. There were some confusing selections, but they were delicious. The metal silver foil ball you would never otherwise put in your mouth was tasty. It was actually more fun not knowing what was coming than selecting your meal, no dish was not perfectly presented and executed with taste and texture. The sommelier did an excellent job telling us about each Spanish wine paired with our meal. The glasses were refilled when empty as well, which is unheard of in France at fixed price.

The restaurant space is intimate with very few tables, all of which however are very wide so there was no risk of fellow diners venturing into our space. As you enter you know you are somewhere really quite special.  The ambience was quiet, formal, downright posh in fact...but equally we didn't feel out of place and the staff were the perfect mix of professional yet not at all snooty. The wine list was vast, but the somelier very helpful - more helpful was that we knew the particular champagne we were looking for, but had that not been the case I have no doubt he would have helped us select the right choice from the three encylcopedias he had to browse through!  The food menu was intricate and really did have a wow factor - I had the lobster which formed two courses and really was a taste sensation (although I'd rather they hadn't kept reminding me that the broth was liquidised head!!!). The amuse bouche were wonderful too and our three course meal was more like seven by the time we had worked through all of that. In fact everything about it really was amazing - Mr Freixa himself even came out and took our orders! My feedback is that this really was an 'experience' for us and was quite formal (you need to dress up for this one). That said, for a couple looking for that special occassion (which it was), it was perfect, it made us feel very special and is something we still talk about a year later!  This all comes at a price, it wasn't cheap, but then you wouldn't expect it to be. It came to just over 300 Euro for the two of us, but 100 Euro of that was on champagne. The dining experience lasted several hours and so really although it was expensive, for what we experienced I think it is actually fair.

For 53 Euros, I found it was almost a bargain considering the location, the service, the quality ! The wine list is beautiful and I did enjoy they have a beautiful and different wine book for red and white wines. A great idea !

Furthermore, this is one of the few authentic Spanish restaurants that can truly accomodate both vegeterians and their parents.

But I decided to be adventurous and it was well worth it.  The restaurant called 2 days before our reservation to make sure we had no allergies and to ask if there was anything we really didn't like to eat. This attention to detail was the first clue as to the amazing culinary experience we were about to embark on.  We chose the 7 course meal and it was definitely enough food. I don't want to give too much detail about the menu because a) it changes daily and b) the surprise is part of what makes it so special. But everything was delicious.  In the first course, caviar was part of the dish. I'm actually not a fan of fish eggs, but I gave it a shot. But I didn't eat ALL of it, which was noticed by the waiter. He asked if anything was wrong and I told him I just wasn't a fan of caviar but that the dish was perfect. Well when another course included caviar, they were sure to leave it off my plate. The service is really spectacular - our glass was never empty, dirty plates were cleared immediately and every dish was explained thoroughly. And trust me, each one is a work of art on it's own unique plate. Every single course was served in a different way and we took pictures of every one. The waiters were patient and friendly.  I really can't say enough good things about Diverxo. You should definitely check it out for yourself. It's a little pricey - the 7 course was 75E pp before drinks, but well worth it (the total bill was about $300 US). Don't be discouraged by the slightly out of the way location.",2011-11-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or170-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19104,0.059,0.752,0.189,0.9942,0.235598544973545,0.5380291005291006,0.4063578947368421,1626,159,0.0977859778597785,0,45,False,77,0.1538461538461538,0.1384615384615384,0.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,0.0153846153846153,0.0153846153846153,0.0307692307692307,0.0769230769230769,0.0461538461538461,313,192,4.185303514376997,0,0,first let tell picki eater sure go enjoy restaur decid adventur well worth restaur call day reserv make sure allergi ask anyth realli like eat attent detail first clue amaz culinari experi embark chose cours meal definit enough food want give much detail menu chang daili b surpris part make special everyth delici first cours caviar part dish actual fan fish egg gave shot eat notic waiter ask anyth wrong told fan caviar dish perfect well anoth cours includ caviar sure leav plate servic realli spectacular glass never empti dirti plate clear immedi everi dish explain thoroughli trust one work art uniqu plate everi singl cours serv differ way took pictur everi one waiter patient friendli realli say enough good thing diverxo definit check littl pricey cours e pp drink well worth total bill us discourag slightli way locat,very good review,5

We ate a Michellin star restaurants our entire honeymoon and actually had the pleasure of eating at Tickets(Ferran Aria ie El Bulli) in Barcelona the night before we dined at Diverxo. And I must say that although Tickets was amazing, Diverxo takes the cake and was the way to cap off our honeymoon. The experience is something that is unique and like I have never experienced before. The Chef/owner Oliver and his wife has assembled an amazing staff, and created a dining experience like no where else. They truely care and want you to leave feeling like you have just experienced the best. The atomsphere is not stuffy like you would find at some restaurants say in Paris(ie Maison Blanche), and the focus is most definitely on the FOOD rather then the appeal. The chef offers 3 set menu options, a 7 course, a 9 course, and the Diverxo experience the 12 course. I made the mistake as an indulger and ordered the 12 course(which would have been fine had I been alone or with a buddy. But my wife is 5'3 and weighs 110lbs, and the course option must be ordered for the entire table). Needless to say each course was filling, and a work of culinary art like I have never seen before. They almost needed to roll us out of the restaurant especially me considering that out of respect for the master Oliver I attempted to finish everything on my wife's plate that she was not able to finish so that we didn't send plates with food back to the kitchen. The wine/drinks were superb to go with each of the courses, and to cap it all off at the end of the night Oliver was there to greet me on our way out the door. Oliver is a star in the cooking world and I hope to have the pleasure of dining at Diverxo again in the future. If you can get a reservation and are in Madrid I would highly suggest this restaurant.

The menu is limited in choice... but still offers more than many other places. The big difference is imagination: fresh Italian ideas are incorporated into the menu and even (in true Italian style) vegetarians are catered for. The wine list is sufficient for most needs: not a huge variety, but the wines are well chosen for taste and value. Tables cater for couples and perhaps one or two small groups. The restaurant is not large. Service is impeccable; swift, friendly and efficient.

To be honest, I was not sure what the difference would or could be.  From the minute you walk in your realise that you are part of an experience, it is not just a meal. The service is efficient, waiters have great personalities and now how to interact with you. You are taken to your table which is completely enclosed/surrounded by a curtain. You are served your first drink and the various meal options are explained. Once you begin the curtains are opened and you can appreciated the decor of the restaurant - a bit like wonderland! We chose a long lunch tasting menu, 12 dishes, 9 savory and 3 sweet. This means that you are eating for 2.5 hours. I enjoyed every single dish. David Muñoz has gained his 3 stars by hard work and dedication to his profession. Having eaten in his Streetxo restaurant in Madrid, you can see that his ethos is reflected in his staff, young, lively and hardworking people. I would love to go back at dinner time, but as we had already waited 6 months for our booking, it will have to be 2017. I would say this is the best meal I have had ever. The restaurant is located in the Euro Building, not the most attractive but easy to get to. The average waitlist for lunch is 7 months and for dinner I understand over 10 months.

Positively for us was the introduction the visit through the kitchen. Also we like the waiter who was very nice and exerted. The tasting menu with 18 courses lasts 5 hours for us a Long way down. Most of the courses were nice but not more. We can't remember any course at the next day.  We think the Chef does a good Job but not more. The courses are to playful but we have been there for the food. To much effort destroys often the taste of the product. In some courses we have seen his talent but not more. The Chef wants to much and for us the kitchen seams very overmotivated but we missed the taste.

I did not have a problem with the duration of my dinner, especially for the price I was paying, but the staff towards the end seemed eager for me to finish my plates quickly, as some of them would be coming around my table several times and asking me if I was done.

Indeed the dishes were evolved and nothing was the same (after almost 6 months since my first visit). I noticed that even the lienzo with the Ossobucco, which I found a bit weird on my last visit, has changed and, instead of macarrones, the chef combined the ossobucco with ravioli al azafran which was much much better! So the dishes evolve and get better. The only dish which I found again a bit weird was the Cocotxa fishy creations, which were too fishy for me (always for my taste). There is nothing more to say on the food as you really need to experience it in order to understand and there are not enough words to say about it / it's surely incredible. The reason I'm rating Diverxo again (with 4 points instead of 5) is that I noticed some worsening of the service in general. In a restaurant of this kind and of this level you cannot disregard the importance of serving your customers. I had to look around for about 5-10 minutes to get an eye contact with someone who could poor some water on my glass. I mean...no problem I could do it by myself if the water bottle was on the table...but the personnel needs to continuously look the customers in the eye, look on their table and track their need; they don't need to look down and only do their specific tasks. I had the impression that they were acting like robots, because obviously they have many things to do, BUT they should not forget that the customer is sitting there and he/she might have a need. They go only by-the-script, which is a shame for such restaurant. So please pay some attention to the customer and the service. It's a pity that such excellence in dish preparation, is overshadowed by service which is not perfect as it should be.

Against my wife's request I opted for the Diverxo 1 tasting menu rather than the tasting menu that was a little smaller. Diverxo 1 was the 3rd largest of the 4 tasting menus offered. I didn't know what to expect since the restaurant combines chinese and spanish cuisine. There were a few items that were too extreme for my wife so I had to eat them (ie hot and sour soup w special noodles - baby eels, fried duck tongues, and squid heads with strawberries). The best bites were some type of oxtail pastry type thing topped with baby eels which was the first course, won ton/dumpling with a cracker, and ox which came as a thick narrow strip steak. I could also eat those fried duck tongues by the bag. So good. Monkfish was also very rich and good. Our reservation was at 10 and we weren't out of there until after 1. If I had to do it over again I would get the 2nd option tasting menu. The 3rd was just way too much food. I can't imagine the Chef David tasting menu which is the 4th option. Service was great and it was real nice talking to the wife of the chef (owner).

During our last trip to Valencia/Mislata, we visited Sabe a Gloria probably six or eight times over the month and had unforgettable experiences every single time. The quality of the food and the kind attention from Gloria and Julián make for a great experience. Imagine Spanish home cooking, as delicious as what a grandmother would make. Now elevate it a bit. Add a bit of sophistication, some touches of elegance. That's the top-notch food from Sabe a Gloria.  We brought a group of students to live in Mislata for that month, and we brought them all here (some went more than once). This diverse crowd included vegetarians and avowed carnivores, and everyone told me they loved it! Fish (especially bacalao, or cod) dishes that even convinced the people who thought they hated fish, meats (pork, beef, poultry) that were expertly prepared, legume-based dishes with impressive flavor, salads of the highest quality.  The most memorable dish (for me, at least) was the crema pasiega, a dessert that is a little like a crême brulée but is baked for several hours at a very low temperature, causing the cream to rise to the top and make a buttery crust... it's a good thing I live so far away, else I'd have to go eat this several times a week. The drinks pairings suggested by Julián, who is an expert sommelier, were always 100% spot on, from the dry aperitifs to the wines with the meal to the dessert wines.  Amazingly, even as busy as they are, Gloria and Julián took the time to learn about us, about our preferences, and sat down with us to create a going-away dinner for our students that left them all open-mouthed. Their reception and attention, combined with the best Spanish homecoming you can eat anywhere, made an indelible impression on us. We have taken so many people to Sabe a Gloria, and everyone leaves with the same reaction, whether they are Mediterranean Spaniards who know how this food is supposed to taste, or university students from the U.S. who have never been to the region before, or even elementary kids.  I can't wait for my next trip to Mislata (in June), mainly so that I can return to this restaurant.

Waitstaff are dress in white shirts and black pants, but with mis-sonneted suspenders and often with spiky hair. We enjoyed the largest tasting menu, which was about 16 courses, but many of the courses consisted of 2-3 sub-courses, so dinner took about 4 hours. There were several courses where one is encouraged to use fingers vs. utensils; I would have preferred to use a spoon. The wine list if good, but not as good as most 3 star restaurants in Spain, and the somm was not very impressive: the I asked about the vintage of a cava on the list he insisted that the wine had been aged (in bottle, on the lees) for 15 years, rather than simply answering my question. In fact the wine (which we consumed at another restaurant the previous night) was a 2007 vintage, which was aged for 5 years on the lees.

The restaurant's front staff asked to see our confirmation; after we presented it, they spent 45 minutes trying to explain how the mishap occurred, with no attempt to provide a legitimate solution. Finally, The David Munoz came to investigate, and we naturally assumed he would come up with a solution to make this difficult situation palatable. Instead of offering a sincere apology, he was shockingly dismissive, providing the explanation that his restaurant -- which holds multiple seatings at various times -- simply could not make any type of accommodation to allow international travelers like us to even taste the food that has earned such international acclaim. Furthermore, he asked us to leave without any alternative solution - namely no recommendation to salvage our evening in Madrid at any other restaurant. It is notable that he owns and runs a more casual restaurant down the street, but this was not mentioned as an alternative.  This experience is telltale in several ways. After dining as guests of Elena Arzak the night before, we quickly realized the implications of a self-proclaimed ""avant-garde"" chef, who believes that he stands above all other 3-Michelin-star geniuses in the value he provides. As guests of a large number of three-star Michelin restaurants across the world, we found it honestly incomprehensible and doubted that any of David Munoz's counterparts would ever have behaved in the same way if presented with the same situation. It speaks to the arrogance and blatant disregard for customers and his disrespect of the most important aspect of running a Michelin-star restaurant - customer service. In conclusion, we would encourage serious caution when considering Diver XO as part of your Spanish haute cuisine experience.",2016-09-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or60-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19307,0.069,0.842,0.089,0.639,0.0396584896584896,0.4547859547859548,0.6006,2032,141,0.0693897637795275,0,47,False,48,0.0491803278688524,0.081967213114754,0.2950819672131147,0.0655737704918032,0.1967213114754098,0.0491803278688524,0.0327868852459016,0.0491803278688524,0.1475409836065573,0.0327868852459016,322,216,5.3105590062111805,0,0,lifetim trip spain profession chicago began amaz dine experi martin berasategui arzak even declin reserv diver xo despit confirm email month prior restaur front staff ask see confirm present spent minut tri explain mishap occur attempt provid legitim solut final david munoz came investig natur assum would come solut make difficult situat palat instead offer sincer apolog shockingli dismiss provid explan restaur hold multipl seat variou time simpli could make type accommod allow intern travel like us even tast food earn intern acclaim furthermor ask us leav without altern solut name recommend salvag even madrid restaur notabl own run casual restaur street mention altern experi telltal sever way dine guest elena arzak night quickli realiz implic self proclaim avant gard chef believ stand michelin star genius valu provid guest larg number three star michelin restaur across world found honestli incomprehens doubt david munoz counterpart would ever behav way present situat speak arrog blatant disregard custom disrespect import aspect run michelin star restaur custom servic conclus would encourag seriou caution consid diver xo part spanish haut cuisin experi,very bad review,1

The curtains that surrounded our table gave us some privacy at the beginning of the diner (they then opened them in order to appreciate the unique decoration of the restaurant). The service was extremely pleasant, the waiters were very efficient, nice, helpful and with a touch of a humor that we particularly appreciated. Regarding the food, every dish we had was beyond original. Except one dish (the ravioli), everything was absolutely spectacular. The chef chose the order of each dish and the quantity are simply perfect in order to enjoy the almost 20 dishes we had to try.

The meal starts surrounded by heavy dark curtains having only candles to light everything up, as the meal continues the curtains are lifted and the lights are turned on.  All this and many other details to create the show feeling.  All over the meal, there was a constant flow of waiters, all very friendly and helpful. And all wearing sneakers :). The meal consists of several sequences and each of 2-3 plates of food. All in all, they try to bring different tastes from different part of the world together, some more successful then others. The curry was rather average, as was the ravioli and the curros. Delicious were the langoustines with strawberry gazpacho, the pulpo with the bone marrow and coconut bubbles. One intended element of surprise are the fish bones, real ones, double fried thus becoming crunchy snack. The dessert was better than average but not exceptional.

We chose the middle option of the menu, so we received a wide variety of courses. Needless to say, most of it was disappointing. The experience was probably the best part. We started out surrounded by a curtain with some props and it tried to approximate a surreal breakfast experience. It was interesting and set a good stage, but the rest of the meal was not as creative or memorable. The props around the restaurant were creative, but seemed random and odd rather than cohesive or edgy. The food was spotty. Some of the dishes were really excellent with many different subtle flavors coming together to create a feeling of ""wow!"", while other dishes were average. Not at all what I would expect from a 3 Michelin star restaurant. Finally, as others have said, the service was lacking. It started out well, but the servers were slow and inattentive.

I wish this was a 5-Star review, but sadly it is not. What started as a superior-in-every-way dining experience deteriorated at the midway point. We selected ""The Experience"" menu with the wine pairings.  We quickly embarked on some of the most exquisite courses we had ever had, with each course, we marveled that this dinner could become one of the all-time best. The seafood courses were complex creations of the most flavorful ingredients and combinations.  But between two superior seafood courses and the upcoming meat course, we had a delay - a very long delay. No explanation, nothing. Just some nods and smiles. Our wine glasses waited empty for the next pairing. We absolutely lost our mood - we became irked. When the meat course finally arrived, we found it absolutely a failure. I beautifully prepared pancetta, with dense fat and barely any meat, and with almost tasteless sides of vegetables purees. Although the dishes remained barely touched, there was no question by the serving staff. When the dishes were removed, I made the comment that the course had been delayed and was a failure. Again, smiles and nods. As you may guess, by this time, we were not pleased with Ramon Freixa. We simply picked at the cheese course and the dessert courses. The delay had cost us time and we were now at 3+ hours for dinner. We asked for the check, paid and left. Note - there was no sign of the chef in the dining room during our visit. Overall, my husband would give this restaurant only 2 stars; I gave three due to the wonderful first part of our meal.

We were greeted by Ramon at the door and quickly shown to our table. Ramon came to us to ask what we had chosen to eat and if we had any allergies. We had booked and planned for the 20 course tasting menu with wine pairing. A good choice as each course is so different that just to chose one or two wines would have been too difficult. I was a bit wary of taking photos of our food but the guests on the next table seemed to know the chef were happy snapping away so I didn't feel uncomfortable about joining in. Down to the food. Each course was a joy. There were some surprises, first time for frogs legs, scorpion fish and rock fish (all delicious). Not too sure about the sea cucumber though but it did offer another texture dimension to the dish. My personal favourite elements were the risotto (wheat?) part of the surf and turf and the consommé which came as part of one of the fish dishes. My husband's favourite was the fish.  The wine pairing was exquisite, the sommelier was knowledgeable without being condescending and each wine perfectly matched the dishes.  Throughout the meal the staff (all elegantly dressed in matching uniforms) displayed an exceptional level of friendly and efficient service that ran like a Swiss watch. My only criticism would be that Ramon Freixa himself spent an inordinate amount of time with the guests on the next table, maybe they were his friends or VIPs but it did feel that he was more interested in their reactions to the food than the other diners.  In my opinion he should give each table equal attention.  All in all a fabulous dining experience though.

I was thinking about ordering the longer menu but our server stressed that we shouldn't order the long menu -too much  food, takes too long, etc. I found that pretty odd. Why offer the long menu if you're going to talk everyone out of it? I didn't see any other diners eating the long menu so I think they must  have been successful in talking everyone out of it. We were told that the standard menu consisted of 7 courses/canvases. We ended up getting 11 though - you get a complimentary appetizer and 3 dessert courses in addition to the 7 on the menu.  The food was outstanding. Everything was very creative with lots of little surprises throughout the evening. It took about 3 hours from start to finish. Service was good but not perfect. E.g. it took them 10-15 minutes to bring a wine list after I requested it. They also forgot to bring us a green drink that accompanied one of the courses.  Overall, we had a great experience. Also, it was a relative bargain for food of this quality. Not sure if it deserves its three star Michelin rating given the service shortcomings.

First time I visited DiverXo was three years ago and already back then I was pretty sure it's been the best food experience in my life. And I do eat at many good places not only in my own city, but also when I travel.  D. Munoz's food is like food heaven. It is an amazing fusion of Spanish and Asian food, with lots of imagination and great experience for all your senses. I am a very picky eater, but here my tears were filled with tears of happiness.  Can't wait to come back. Cons: some of the waiters don't speak English. And couple of times they couldn't answer some of our questions (""these are the cheeks of an animal"" ""ok, which animal"" ""i don't know""). This I wouldn't really tolerate at any other place, but the food here mesmerized me, so I didn't really care. Whatever animal, it tasted like heaven.

On the other hand serving everything on the surface of a table neither makes it conceptual, nor makes the food tastier. The service was terrible. Imagine that in each course of the degustation menu (about 14 courses) we kept on asking for a waiter that spoke english to explain to us the dishes. So until they find the translator each and every time, we decided to say goodbye to the courses that were supposed to be served hot.The architecture of the restaurant was too blusterous. Even the music drove me crazy, I believe we heard a song called Alegria about 6-8 times in two hours.  In fact the word pretentious describes my whole experience there.

I couldn't find availability, yet again, on this trip, but my assistant emailed the restaurant asking for any vacancies for a small group of 5 people, and Mrs. Maria Sanchez, the reservations agent at the restaurant, was extremely kind offering us their private dining room, which we happily accepted. The restaurant's entrance is a bit oddly located; it's part of the new SPG Unico Hotel, in the classy neighbourhood of Barrio de Salamanca, but the access is down a ramp that looks like it'll take you to a garage, rather than through the hotel's door. My partner, a friend, and myself arrived a bit early and were shown to the private dining room straight away and served champagne while we waited for the other couple. The common area of the restaurant is pretty small; just a handful of tables, so that explains why it's so difficult to find an open time slot. The private dining room was rather large, which allowed for plenty of table space; they had situated our plates in the centre of a 12-person table, so we all sat very comfortably. There's a sliding smoked-glass door that gives the room from the kitchen area, and huge opening covered with a thick curtain separating it from the common dining room. We had already set our minds on the 25-course menu (which turned out to have more than 25 courses in the end). I'm a fan of long dinners with lots of courses, and I love trying as much of a chef's work as humanly possible during one sitting, so this worked very well for me. Service was exquisite. They were extremely attentive with our group, always caring for our drinks, refilling our water, making sure everything was perfect. We all spoke both English and Spanish except for my partner, so our waiters and servers all addressed us in English (most of them with excellent communications skills, I must say). They made our meal even more enjoyable with their personal touch. Before I dig into the food, I have to take my hat off to Mr. Freixa himself, who graced us with his presence several times during the meal, gentle-mannered, regaling us with little anecdotes, or just presenting a dish himself. I've been to quite a few Michelin restaurants by now and I have never felt so taken care of... I'd dare say I even felt special (and my co-diners all agreed with me). Now, 25 (probably 28ish, though I admit I forgot to take pictures of some of them) courses are a lot of courses, so regardless of how fast the service is, it'll take a minimum of 4 hours eat your way through this menu. 4 absolutely wonderful hours filled with culinary magic. Delicate flavour combinations, exquisite ingredients of the best quality, imaginative modern dishes with Spanish inspirations. Dish after dish after dish of food that made our eyes water. Sighs pleasure, gasps of excitement were constantly heard coming from our table. Nothing I say, no amount of adjectives I use, will do justice to such phenomenal dining experience.

The other main is a risotto with shredded duck confit & prawn broth & shrimp ceviche on a piece of lime Finally we get to the dessert, we have chocolate mousse, caramel sauce and sponge. It's artistic but nothing that I would remember for a long time kind of dessert (or I'm just too jet lagged and intoxicated by this time)...2 hours into our meal Included are a little plate of sweets, 2 chocolate truffles and little baked goodies. Meal also includes coffee, water, bread service and 10% VAT. $60 per person for all this in a beautiful setting, elegant stemware & plating but without the stuffy atmosphere of a traditional fine dining restaurant.",2017-05-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or90-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19334,0.025,0.833,0.142,0.994,0.1842391304347826,0.5701086956521738,0.4158133333333333,1973,128,0.0648758236188545,0,65,False,67,0.1176470588235294,0.1911764705882352,0.3382352941176471,0.0294117647058823,0.088235294117647,0.0294117647058823,0.0147058823529411,0.0294117647058823,0.1176470588235294,0.0441176470588235,351,232,4.6239316239316235,0,0,enjoy short menu avail monday friday lunch euro pp first arriv glass hous cava negroni drink delici next shave paper thin piec salami thin cracker tomato spread finest interpret deli next shitak freez dri shitak mushroom origin mushroom earthi tast interest twist textur crunchi airi weird good fork thai coconut piec seawe pine nut float dri ice artist present next foi paper thin cracker eel appl stone spoon tast delici know rock made kinda pop mouth delici liquid broth kind tast pine nut next egg mouss like textur similar japanes steam egg finer textur tast trout broth flavor paprika next quail egg caviar waffl hous made bread offer flown bake barcelona green oliv oil fresh tast butter herb get enough bread rememb stuff next main choic tast canelonni type meat mushroom sauc darn delici realli pick one main would go one main risotto shred duck confit prawn broth shrimp cevich piec lime final get dessert chocol mouss caramel sauc spong artist noth would rememb long time kind dessert jet lag intox time hour meal includ littl plate sweet chocol truffl littl bake goodi meal also includ coffe water bread servic vat per person beauti set eleg stemwar plate without stuffi atmospher tradit fine dine restaur,good review,4

Minor criticism I think, as it is only minor. The restaurant needed gentle background music to start. These places can be quite clinical and uppity if you leave the guest with no noise at all. It is supposed to be a feast for the senses, and yes I appreciate you want the guest to hear various bubblings and sizzlings as amazing dishes are served, but surely this can be managed if balanced right? The only criticism of the food? The scorpion fish needed a miniscule amount of salt to taste, & regarding the drink, this was the first time I have had Sherry served with a dish, albeit an incredible 30 year old Sherry! but it was still quite harsh I thought with food - but that is a personal opinion. Now...Enough!...This place is amazing. How many 2 star eateries do you know, whereby the titled Chef humbly comes out at the beginning of the night, introduces themselves to you personally, and then asks you what would you like for Dinner? How this restaurant has got 2 michelin stars and not 3 is beyond me? The dishes are more 2/3 star consistent than at El Club Allard, and having eaten now at Six 2* restaurants, the only Chef to match this standard of cooking is Marcus Waring (who also deserves 3 stars in my opinion!). The technique, flavours, textures, balance, and the pure freshness and quality of ingredients were mind blowing. The (majority Spanish) wine flight served was incredible, and was an education in what world class Spanish wines are actually out there. It was an incredible Dinner, made even more special by the staff kindly acknowledging our wedding anniversary. Utterly brilliant and highly recommended.",2017-09-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or80-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19335,0.039,0.839,0.122,0.982,0.2649134199134199,0.5521019721019721,0.5525733333333334,1659,134,0.0807715491259795,3,49,False,54,0.1428571428571428,0.1632653061224489,0.2244897959183673,0.0408163265306122,0.1428571428571428,0.0612244897959183,0.0204081632653061,0.0204081632653061,0.1020408163265306,0.0816326530612244,291,192,4.70446735395189,0,0,start minor critic think minor restaur need gentl background music start place quit clinic uppiti leav guest nois suppos feast sens ye appreci want guest hear variou bubbl sizzl amaz dish serv sure manag balanc right critic food scorpion fish need miniscul amount salt tast regard drink first time sherri serv dish albeit incred year old sherri still quit harsh thought food person opinion enough place amaz mani star eateri know wherebi titl chef humbl come begin night introduc person ask would like dinner restaur got michelin star beyond dish star consist el club allard eaten six restaur chef match standard cook marcu ware also deserv star opinion techniqu flavour textur balanc pure fresh qualiti ingredi mind blow major spanish wine flight serv incred educ world class spanish wine actual incred dinner made even special staff kindli acknowledg wed anniversari utterli brilliant highli recommend,good review,4

But, since we had made the reservation, we decided to go and we were thankful that we did! The restaurant is easy to find and is in a quaint area near the palace. We arrived before the restaurant opened for dinner, but the bar was open and we had a glass of wine while waiting. This is a traditional Spanish restaurant with a large menu! It is a very very small restaurant with two small rooms in the cellar area (5 tables in one room and 4 in other) and a small room upstairs with 4 tables. So reservations in advance are a must. We ate in the cellar in the ""cave"" that was used to cure the hams! Very romantic and intimate setting. The service was impeccable throughout the meal. Carlos waited on us and he speaks excellent English which greatly helped in selecting courses and wine. He is also an outstanding server--friendly, outgoing and enthusiastic! We split a salad, and for entrees ordered a steak and a pork steak. Both were perfectly prepared and amazing cuts of meat. The pork was especially delicious--it was the Iberian pork which has a different texture and taste--a must try!! We also enjoyed a great bottle of Spanish red which perfectly complemented the entrees. We finished with a wonderful dessert. This was probably the best dinner we had while in Spain based on the ambiance, quality of food and service.

Decor much more imaginative and sophisticated - albeit in a fun way - than the previous locations.  A feel good factor descends as you arrive and leave coats before climbing the stairs to the restaurant.  Tables nicely spaced and large with plenty of room  Two menus on offer, a normal and the glutton! We went for the glutton - of course.  A mixture of textures and flavours. Presentation good and many dishes came with multiple parts - finish one part and the next arrived.  Most dishes had some spice to them - which generally worked.  Compared to previous visit a couple of years ago the food showed more maturity and less trying for he sake of trying.  Good selection of wines - much improved on the previous restaurants, although not sure that it is sufficient for a 3 star restaurant.  Service good and professional. Many young and willing in their multicoloured munchkin outfits. Not at all stuffy as in certain other places.

Each dinner was exceptional in its own way, elegant, beautifully presented and delicious, creative food. Each small bite or dish was exquisite, each meal was substantial and I loved the creativity of each of these chefs. The service at each location was superb, the staff were extremely educated on the dishes and eager to share their knowledge, and extremely attentive to your needs and desires. You left each location feeling pampered. Each location was a special, elegant restaurant where you did not feel out of place in jeans and a nice shirt. Each was artfully decorated, and beautiful in its own right. Note: These dinners allow the chefs to be creative in their art, this is not the place you come to for standard fare. Enjoying this meal includes opening you mind and palate to the possibilities and creativity of each of these artists.  Dinner at each of these restaurants is a decadent treat and I was privileged to be able to do three of these on consecutive nights. Specific to Ramon Freixa. This was my favorite dinner among the three.  Food: Exquisite, creative food. We did the Experience Menu in 20 bites. I loved the creative combinations of flavors, the different textures and the flow through the courses. The dinner was substantial and we left feeling full. They have a wonderful wine list, full of gems if you look hard enough.  Ambiance: We ate at the newly renovated restaurant on day 4 after they opened. We loved the decor and the luxurious touches, the decor did not however distract from the food that was the star. The space makes you feel comfortable and relaxed.  Service: Exceptional. The staff was attentive and always on hand to help in any way. We never had to ask for anything, it was like they anticipated our every need.  We loved the restaurant and would recommend it highly.

The short menu gives a glimpse of Chef Ramon Freixa's playfulness and creativity without sacrificing the natural flavours of every ingredient. Chef Ramon Freixa magically surprises your palate with wonderful ephemeral flavours that leave a smile on your lips. Among his main courses, the wild salmon with bitter herbs, pork belly soup with Iberican squid niguiri and the three roasted meats cannelloni are equally divine! The ""postre"" or dessert is a fantastic symphony of a thin sheets of rolled chocolate wafer accompanied by milk chocolate mousse, dark chocolate, cream and a crispy hazelnut sponge cake that looked like a sea sponge. To the very last, when you cap your splendid meal with coffee, you will be spoiled yet again with a delectable petit fours. What tops this experience is that despite the fame, Chef Ramon Freixa remains genuinely warm and very welcoming, taking time to check on his guests. This makes you feel at home in this magical dining place. And what Chef Ramon Freixa said about preparing food to make people happy, this is exactly what he does, dish after dish.

They liked it so much they ate here twice. We were instructed to dine in the cave (you can state your preference in the notes section when you book online) and we would recommend the same. The main dining room is fine but it doesn’t have the same character. The restaurant is located on a side street very close to the Royal Palace but for some reason our taxi driver had difficulty finding it. He turned off his meter, recognizing that it was taking him longer that it should have which was contrary to everything you hear about taxis and tourists in Europe!

You do not get to see what each course will present. We opted for the 12, thinking there would be a little bit of everything, however, the 12 course ended up being too much and things started to repeat themselves. I did not expect the overkill of fish and seafood in the dishes. I unfortunately can only tolerate so much of it before it becomes overwhelming for my palate and nose. My husband who will eat every and anything agreed that the fishiness in the food started to take a toll on him after awhile. At first it was admirable that our wait staff noticed that I was not able to eat a few things. I was told that my menu was going to be tweaked so that it would not have as much of the fish and seafood. But, as the dishes kept coming, the fishiness was still potent. After I had to ask what was going on, I was then told that the chef said I was just going to have to go with it. The wait staff was very professional and the course presentations are all beautiful and dramatic. The plating is fun and different with the various shapes and colors.

It not not overpriced considering the type of standing (3 star Michelin) we are talking about, and indeed wines are considerably cheap, which comes as a surprise. Th experience begins as early as when you first walk into the reception area, being welcome by someone wearing a futuristic type of uniform with trainers on.  The decoration throughout the restaurant is made to surprise up to very little details you will or may (or not) notice and come across. The setting is also set to revolutionise this rather conservative and predictable industry, kitchen block standing in the middle of the restaurant room, tables places so they can be isolated using light curtains, therefore creating differents types of ambiance. The staff and service in general is also quite amazingly different and gives this experience a much appreciated taste of change, if compared to the usual, very expectable type of service. Although first usual habits and our comfort zone is first, purposely challenged by David Munoz, I settled and enjoyed living a new and what I knew would be a unique experience. What I mean by ""missing target by trying too hard"" started when, unfortunately, the actual main purpose of attending a restaurant began : drinking and eating. Choosing a wine (no per glass per course option) that could suit the whole meal is, in my opinion impossible. The variety of tastes and food styles provided is large and therefore one wine only option is an error, which unfortunately no-one can avoid, unless you decide to stick to water (which may have been the best idea thinking back). On the food front, David Munoz demonstrates his extremely strong and unique identity by proposing a menu where he clearly intends to show and share all that goes on in his creative mind. Now this creativity is great, only that it totally lacks organising and ordering, as well as electing, and therefore leaving out, some dishes or courses. In short, the set meal (there are 2 but both lead to the same issue) is just a succession of courses, which does not have any logic, taste-wise, even diet-wise, and is, even in the short menu case, too long by 2-3 courses (out of 8). Another point, even more worrying to me, is the deliberate choice of some cooking techniques (especially to deliver fish), which simply taste awfuly bad and sickening. This makes the meal surprise you nicely at a few points along the journey, but because of these cooking techniques mistakes (I cannot see what else it could be) and the far too long series of dishes not making any logic sense in the way they are sequenced, one ends up far too full far too quickly. Add the impossible wine selection on top that cannot help eating all this because no good fit is possible.  Feeling sick is what happens there and this is a real shame for a place like this. This is what I mean by trying too hard. Unfortunately, It is impossible that one gets to taste all that the chef has in his creative mind, therefore stricter and more thought through choice must be made in order to give sense to the experience.",2015-12-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or80-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19383,0.086,0.833,0.081,-0.8398,0.0532348484848484,0.5677431457431457,0.5310722222222223,3298,250,0.0758035172832019,0,80,False,98,0.0775193798449612,0.0852713178294573,0.2713178294573643,0.0620155038759689,0.1007751937984496,0.0232558139534883,0.0387596899224806,0.1007751937984496,0.1317829457364341,0.1085271317829457,577,346,4.714038128249567,0,0,let set straight first although bring neg point say remind anyon intend attend restaur uniqu experi worth go least go back overpr consid type stand star michelin talk inde wine consider cheap come surpris th experi begin earli first walk recept area welcom someon wear futurist type uniform trainer decor throughout restaur made surpris littl detail may notic come across set also set revolutionis rather conserv predict industri kitchen block stand middl restaur room tabl place isol use light curtain therefor creat differ type ambianc staff servic gener also quit amazingli differ give experi much appreci tast chang compar usual expect type servic although first usual habit comfort zone first purpos challeng david munoz settl enjoy live new knew would uniqu experi mean miss target tri hard start unfortun actual main purpos attend restaur began drink eat choos wine per glass per cours option could suit whole meal opinion imposs varieti tast food style provid larg therefor one wine option error unfortun one avoid unless decid stick water may best idea think back food front david munoz demonstr extrem strong uniqu ident propos menu clearli intend show share goe creativ mind creativ great total lack organis order well elect therefor leav dish cours short set meal lead issu success cours logic tast wise even diet wise even short menu case long cours anoth point even worri deliber choic cook techniqu especi deliv fish simpli tast awfuli bad sicken make meal surpris nice point along journey cook techniqu mistak cannot see els could far long seri dish make logic sens way sequenc one end far full far quickli add imposs wine select top cannot help eat good fit possibl feel sick happen real shame place like mean tri hard unfortun imposs one get tast chef creativ mind therefor stricter thought choic must made order give sens experi,bad review,2

It's a block from one of the main roads, tucked away from the throngs of tourists, with only 25 seats. As is typical of American tourists, we were there early at 8:30 p.m. when they opened. The host (who also served as our waiter) was quiet, but very friendly and helpful, particularly in addressing the gluten free needs of one of our party members. The food was simply delicious and beautifully presented. Two in our party shared a large salad that included sun dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, cherry tomatoes, lettuce and mozzarella.

They also have English menus and they speak English really well, though we had more fun talking in Spanish.  We got the calamares bao, which was what caught our eye in the first place. It was like a bocadillo calamares but with a Chinese bao instead. The bao was perfect and everything you would expect a Bao to be - so white and fluffy. It was actually quite large too, which makes up for the higher price. We also got the Iberian Bacon pinxto. Imagine a huge chunk of pork belly, caramelized on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. Definitely an unexpected highlight. Honestly, if he could add a Bao to that too, it would be heaven. It was pretty empty when we got there so we were also able to chat with who I believe might be the owner.

We wandered into Sabe a Gloria and didn't regret it.  The food was fresh and marvelous and the staff didn't hesitate to make suggestions for our menu selections, which was fun.

Since it was our first time we preferred to try the Experience Menu, for which many other reviewers wrote, so I cannot add more. The chef is taking his risks I would say...but I liked that. I hardly make it for the last dessert dish, so be prepared - it´s much food and the price is very good for such quality.  The atmosphere is pleasant, although in the beginning you might feel it a bit formal, it becomes warmer as the chef comes to your table, which I believe is a very good ´move´ to make quests more comfortable and understand their needs.

I cannot begin to describe the enchanting experience we had here. Starting with Ramon himself taking our orders and welcoming us, to the second to none service we received, every moment of the experience must have be carefully master planned by the creative genius behind what is Ramon Freixa. We enjoyed the Experience Menu with Wine Pairing; which is likely more food than you can likely handle, but, trust me, its too good to leave on your plate. Definitely do a tasting menu with a wine pairing, worth every penny and then some. Don't fill up on the bread to much, which is hard to do considering its taste and freshness. This is a must visit restaurant. Only 35 seats so make a reservation.  This is an experience, and I do not want to spoil it for you with details of what we enjoyed, just know that you are in for a real treat, which will likely rank as one of the best you will ever have.

My wife then had pasta stuffed with boletus (marvellous) and I had a tuna steak which was perfect.

We visited on a Saturday evening at about 22.00 and had no problem getting a table. We were welcomed by the manager/ owner who had excellent English and was happy to talk us through the menu, including suggesting what could be customised to be cheese and meat free. The restaurant is small and quirkily decorated- we liked the cheese grater light especially. I ordered a salad, customised with no meat or cheese and extra aubergine, while my partner ordered a Margherita pizza. We also ordered some excellent and cheap Prosecco. We were given a bruschetta starter on the house before our meals arrived. My salad was delicious- big and leafy, with mango and aubergine and a tasty berry dressing- unusual and perfect for the hot weather! Bread and nice oil and vinegar were provided. When we requested the bill the manager offered us a liqueur on the house- a lovely gesture. The bill for two- only 25E.

It was also not our 1st choice (being in Madrid and having Italian food is not really what we wanted) but our 3 previous choices were either full or didn't fulfill our expectations... However we really liked it and was a good thing that we couldn't go to those restaurants as we had the pleasure to discover this one. The restaurant is quite small and located in the city the center (close to the Madrid's Atocha train station) and the atmosphere is quite nice in an Osteria Italian style and what makes it really ""genuine"", if you can say that, is that the owner/cook is wondering around in the tables to suggest some dishes, asking if food is of your liking thus making it a closer and intimate atmosphere. Food is very good, not a delicious treat but really really good and was served very fast. The only downside was that his employee was not fast enough between dishes and forgot our table the whole dinner.

It is a slice of Italy in Madrid. My friend and I both ordered a pizza, which were excellent. First of all, for me, the key is the dough, which was cooked perfectly on the bottom and wasn't to thin, which seems to be the case in many pizzerias in Madrid. The mozzarella was gooey and fresh. I ordered La Locura, which has pieces of bacon and rucula spread over the top. The size of the pizza was perfect for one person, filling but so much that you feel like immediately going home and taking a siesta. The price is 10.50€. We ordered a glass of the Sangiovese red for 2.60€, which was average but good. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere was like a small bistro in a neighborhood of Roma, for example. A nice touch was when the chef came out to ask all of the diners how everything was. I look forward to going back and trying one of the pasta dishes, which I saw the table next to us eating, and the size of the portion looked just right as well.

Having read through some of the critics of the place, expectations have admittedly been quite high.  We went for the large menu selection, being aware this might be a bit of a stretch which it was.  Why only an average rating? Service was nice and attentive, but just not up to the standard they promise. Also, we gave the sommelier (who we believe was just another standard waiter) free hand with wine selection which unfortunately didn't yield a superior result in wine pairing and selection. They did stay on the relative cheap side of things, which I appreciate, but the selection we got was rather random.

I went to his Restaraunt a week ago and was so surprised by the friendliness and closeness of the staff that I forgot it was a posh restaurant.  The food was superb. Combinations I had never thought of. I went with a discount from the usual web sites, that wasn't applicable for a menu. Ramon himself came out and asked our preferences and organized a menu for us. I thought, oh dear. A way to avoid the discount.  I was wrong. We received a menu of maybe 12 dishes and had a discount. I met Ramon. I had possibly the best meal in Spain for 3 years (that is saying a lot. The quality here is high) and never had the feeling of pretentious waiters or snooty staff. It was a pleasure. Plates by Versace (I think). Food personally selected by Ramon and ok, a price that matches a good meal. But well worth it as an experience.

It looks like someone has designed their dream restaurant, complete with curtains that can enclose every table (bit like a hospital bed - sorry, but true), amazing lighting and a very interesting workspace in the centre of the room. Oh, and the flying pigs have had a makeover too. This was my fourth time at Diverxo and my first time at the new place. The menu was spectacular, of course, but I can't help wishing that chef Dabiz would try to stop out-doing himself. I think he has reached a level now which he should just maintain instead of trying to better.  Because it wasn't any better than any previous time. Just weirder.  I don't mind weird, but when things just don't make sense I lose interest. And this menu didn't make sense. It got so vague in the middle that we were just baffled. And not in a good way. When the curtains were wrapped around our table and the music box appeared in the centre of the table with 1970s French music we just wondered what was going on. We had covered dishes in front of us which we weren't allowed to touch and a waiter beside each of us, making us really uncomfortable, just staring at us. Then they went ""okay you can eat now."" It was just so random. There were thirteen different parts to that dish. It was just too much. The staff, and especially the chef, still have the same level of arrogance as usual and didn't want to serve me the longest tasting menu because I don't eat seafood. We advised when we made the booking months beforehand that I don't eat seafood and that we would like the long tasting menu. At any other restaurant it would have been no problem. But here the customer doesn't decide what they eat. (We did manage to get the long tasting menu in the end - they just took off the seafood. Why couldn't they do that in the first place?) They have changed the ""costumes"" that the waiting staff wear. If they didn't look bad before, they look like escaped convicts now. And the service was so chaotic (I think that's on purpose) that there was no way to relax at all. Despite everything I have said, I have given five stars and at 200€ per person excl. drinks (and therefore being the most expensive tasting menu in Madrid now) I still think it was good value. This was my fourth time at Diverxo and I would go back. But it's not high on my list after this latest experience.",2015-02-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or100-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19469,0.081,0.806,0.113,0.9479,0.0961810411810411,0.5025407925407925,0.4189,2377,223,0.0938157341186369,0,74,False,87,0.1168831168831168,0.0649350649350649,0.2467532467532467,0.0519480519480519,0.1428571428571428,0.0389610389610389,0.0389610389610389,0.0779220779220779,0.1428571428571428,0.0779220779220779,441,259,4.387755102040816,0,0,diverxo new venu breathtak look like someon design dream restaur complet curtain enclos everi tabl bit like hospit bed sorri true amaz light interest workspac centr room oh fli pig makeov fourth time diverxo first time new place menu spectacular cours help wish chef dabiz would tri stop think reach level maintain instead tri better better previou time weirder mind weird thing make sens lose interest menu make sens got vagu middl baffl good way curtain wrap around tabl music box appear centr tabl french music wonder go cover dish front us allow touch waiter besid us make us realli uncomfort stare us went okay eat random thirteen differ part dish much staff especi chef still level arrog usual want serv longest tast menu eat seafood advis made book month beforehand eat seafood would like long tast menu restaur would problem custom decid eat manag get long tast menu end took seafood first place chang costum wait staff wear look bad look like escap convict servic chaotic think purpos way relax despit everyth said given five star per person excl drink therefor expens tast menu madrid still think good valu fourth time diverxo would go back high list latest experi,average review,3

It sells this restaurant as something extravagant, special, unique, controversial, drugged. In real, you will get childish interior, funny waiters and mainly, disgusting food. Just to clarify, I visited most of top or three michelin restaurants like El Bulli, Noma, Roca's etc. and also most of Asia's countries, so statement it's modern asia gastronomy (we were told this by a waiter after we wanted less pepper, which is exaggerated in almost every dish), but this is like if young child is trying to be in world of adults. Ok, a plus for chef is he is doing it in your own way, that's positive, but it's only positive and it's like if a musical group doing funny things on stage, but music itself is poor. For example, we got a soup in medical test-tube or sauce given in medical syringe; is anyone still hungry? Or, we got horseradish in a foam. So what? I think I'm against most of reviewers, but this is so obsolete. Even if you accept the bizarre interior (after all, why not), time of molecular gastronomy is over for many years now and various ingredients together are absolutely not working here. Above all, we have unpleasant diarrhoea next day and we felt like we were abused to this nonsensical experiment, created by young child.",2015-01-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or100-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19470,0.097,0.758,0.145,0.9194,0.1434291898577613,0.566542980828695,0.4572272727272727,1298,102,0.0785824345146379,0,50,False,34,0.1463414634146341,0.1097560975609756,0.2439024390243902,0.073170731707317,0.1219512195121951,0.0365853658536585,0.0609756097560975,0.048780487804878,0.0975609756097561,0.0609756097560975,225,160,4.773333333333333,0,0,restaur modern almost perfect market sell restaur someth extravag special uniqu controversi drug real get childish interior funni waiter mainli disgust food clarifi visit top three michelin restaur like el bulli noma roca etc also asia countri statement modern asia gastronomi told waiter want less pepper exagger almost everi dish like young child tri world adult ok plu chef way posit posit like music group funni thing stage music poor exampl got soup medic test tube sauc given medic syring anyon still hungri got horseradish foam think review obsolet even accept bizarr interior time molecular gastronomi mani year variou ingredi togeth absolut work unpleas diarrhoea next day felt like abus nonsens experi creat young child,very bad review,1

But if you're the kind of person who has many allergies or food restrictions, then you should maybe try somewhere else... We tried making a reservation on this restaurant as soon as we got to Madrid, but it was full until like February... BUT there was a cancellation and I guess we insisted so much they called us! This restaurant recently got it's third Michelin star and it's pretty much the place to be in Madrid right now... And if you're planning on going to Spain, MAKE this reservation, you won't regret it. The atmosphere is weird and as we got there, there was a light smoke all over the place, which was probably the worst thing about this experience, but it didn't affect our overall impression It's a degustation menu, you can choose between the 7 and the 11 courses menu (and the whole table has to choose the same amount of courses). The food is fusion and you must go there knowing you'll eat things you have absolutely no idea of what are... I mean, we ate meat and found out it was actually tuna... Yeah, prepare yourself! But this made the dinner even more special. The combinations were like a peace of art, the flavors were rich and the food was refined and delightful! We couldn't decide on what was the best dish... They were all remarkable!  I've been to many 2 and 3 Michelin stars and I just can't take this restaurant off my mind. Best meal I've ever had!  And oh! The 7 courses were enough, but I would suggest that, if you're going to this restaurant, don't eat much on lunch or in the afternoon, make sure you get there starving and order the 11 courses menu.

Fortunately they had a cancellation and we were immediately ushered into the dining room. Tables are large, yet each is reserved for only one seating. The presentation is great, and the cutlery and plate selection imaginative and corresponds to each dish. We did not have the tasting menu because we were tired from a long day traveling. Nevertheless, our entrees were accompanied by several other matching dishes that were spectacular. It was a memorable meal, and the wine list is extensive and fairly priced. I will definitely be back for a complete tasting meal on a future visit to madrid. Be warned this is modern molecular cuisine.

We should have turned back when we entered the restaurant and smelled a horrible sulfur (sewage?) smell. We mentioned it to the staff who dismissed us.  We grew accustomed to it when very unusual food was brought out that had significant smells of their own...when my husband and I each went to the restroom at different time we realized the source of the offensive odor--it was horrible. Some of the was interesting, some looked fine and unique but was so unusual on the palate it was hard to swallow, other items were inedible. One of the worst things was the sherry that was part of the wine pairings.  The lights were extremely bright, service was fine until it was time for the check--which took a very long time. Another couple in the restaurant fell asleep--the entire evening had the feeling of a Robert Altman movie or a Salvador Dali painting.

Ramon himself took our order and as soon as we mentioned we did not eat pig one of the appetizers was immediately whisked away from our table and replaced - impressive service indeed. Each course is a work of art with some extremely original ideas giving a broad range of textures and tastes, there are some ""gimmicks"" and overall this was quite a filling meal, the duck liver slice particularly so. Quite simply we enjoyed everything and this cuisine certainly ranks among the best we have tasted in recent years. The wine lists are amazing with some great bins from around the world although we were only interested in Spain and we selected a great ""Nelin"", a rich white from Clos Magador in Priorat.

And that's saying something because we got off to a really bad start. Twenty minutes to get a glass of wine ordered from the time we were seated. Then, when asked if I'd like chopsticks to which I replied in the affirmative, none ever arrived, but the food transcended all. An amuse bouche of edamame seasoned, perhaps with sumac and something else with a buttermilk-like garlic dipping sauce. Then we both had the seven course tasting menu (the other choice being the thirteen course menu). The seven courses were actually around eleven since a course would often be divided into two halves served sequentially, like the poached prawn (it was called something else) that arrived followed by the grilled, seasoned, head and body with the juices from the body drizzled over the poached tail. Somewhere in the middle were white asparagus wrapped in the skin of red mullet - actually the meal involved parts of red mullet in several of the dishes, such as a pate of red mullet liver on a thin crisp. The courses that I sort of remember include the soup served in a young coconut shell where eating the coconut meat was a desired part of the experience, a steamed roll with a quail's egg yolk barely poached on top, an extraordinary piece of tuna cheek that tasted like a sous-vide cooked short rib, and a piece of ox cheek that had been slow roasted for 112 hours, a small piece of hake served sauced accompanied by a horseradish cream and spherified lime, and a desert which I no longer remember.

I chose it simply by searching the TripAdvisor map for this part of town. I have just had one of the best gastronomic experiences ever. Once I got past the sticker shock (95 euros for the short menu and 137 euros for the long menu), the fun began. The service is exceptional if not somewhat overstaffed (every person seemed to have one specific job - e.g. the lemon zester guy, the last-minute-sauce guy, the napkin folder guy, etc.) Everyone is multilingual, pleasant and informative. In fact, if we left a few items on the plate they seemed sincerely concerned with whether or not we liked it. The presentations are varied and innovative. The food...wow. The kitchen challenges anything your palate has ever expected from a particular ingredient. Seafood, fish, meats, vegetables, sauces all presented spectacularly, colourfully, artistically - but most importantly - the tastes are outstanding. My guest and I walked away from one of the most pleasant dining experiences ever.

The location is really odd and the entrance door is totally black and if you don't look around, you could easily passed by.

And the price has nothing to do with other 3-Michelin-Star restaurant.  Wonderful experience and please go with your beloved who also respect and appreciate good food.

My wife and I had an amazing dinner at La Mi Vent during our last night in Madrid. The ambiance is unique and inviting, from the old wood fired oven to the comfy bar to the dining area in the old downstairs wine cellar. On of the most delicious, and simple, things I have ever had is their complimentary soup made with iberico pork bones - just wonderful and inviting. We started with one of their iberico charcuterie plates, which did not disappoint. It included some traditional iberico ham, chorizo, a salami type sausage and some beef ham with some manchego - all extremely good. We also had the pan con tomate, which was just okay. It was served differently as the Cristal bread was served separately from the tomato (which we we're not really into), and the bread was overly toasted. Our main course was terrific - grilled iberico pork served on anhot, sizzling plater with padron peppers (yum!), and potatoes. The pork was some of the best I've had. It was cooked perfectly, with a wonderful sear and flavor. I would eat this dish every day.  Desert fell flat however. We tried torrija de toffee which was just much to sweet - tasty but much, much to sweet for our tastes. The wine list is really nice, with many different types, regions and costs available. I also need to mention their house olive oil - wow. I have never had an olive oil quite like it. We ended up buying a bottle to bring back with us.

This year we booked a last minute trip to Madrid and unfortunately Roman's restaurant was fully booked for dinner - however, lunch was a possibility. I had pinned my hopes on dinner so it was with trepidation that I booked lunch. Our generous hosts booked us into the private room where the two of us could enjoy dinner in solitude. My wife was delighted, going to Ramon's restaurant had already been in her mind (despite my best attempts to disguise my plan) and the private experience had been a wonderful surprise. Given our tricky diets (vegetarian/vegan/pescatarian), I had arranged for us to enjoy a simple menu, hopeful that this would enough for us to enjoy Ramon's excellent creations. Well, this clearly was not going to work for Ramon who joined us in the private room and enquired what we would like to enjoy for lunch. My wife, who is not often lost for words, was speechless. A long time admirer of his work she was almost beside herself with excitement. We enjoyed an eleven course marvel of creation, from cheese eggs to bubbly sangria. I would love to go into the detail that would justify the tastes but it's simply not possible, certainly the best gastronomic experience that we have ever enjoyed. Two bottles of wine, eleven incredible courses and 4 hours with our ever attentive hosts. The restaurant tried to put a price on this but it was well under what it will be worth to us in memories over the coming years.",2014-11-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or210-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19505,0.029,0.791,0.18,0.9896,0.3392006802721088,0.5632227891156462,0.4049666666666667,1573,130,0.0826446280991735,0,35,False,65,0.1927710843373494,0.1686746987951807,0.3012048192771084,0.1204819277108433,0.1325301204819277,0.0120481927710843,0.0,0.0240963855421686,0.036144578313253,0.0120481927710843,281,168,4.601423487544484,0,0,year tri outdo previou attempt make wife birthday magic experi year manag year book last minut trip madrid unfortun roman restaur fulli book dinner howev lunch possibl pin hope dinner trepid book lunch gener host book us privat room two us could enjoy dinner solitud wife delight go ramon restaur alreadi mind despit best attempt disguis plan privat experi wonder surpris given tricki diet vegetarian vegan pescatarian arrang us enjoy simpl menu hope would enough us enjoy ramon excel creation well clearli go work ramon join us privat room enquir would like enjoy lunch wife often lost word speechless long time admir work almost besid excit enjoy eleven cours marvel creation chees egg bubbl sangria would love go detail would justifi tast simpli possibl certainli best gastronom experi ever enjoy two bottl wine eleven incred cours hour ever attent host restaur tri put price well worth us memori come year,very good review,5

The right side is were the experience resides.  There are three tasting menus.  For ease of reference, I will call them small medium and large.  Small means don't eat lunch.  Medium means skip breakfast and lunch.  Large means start your fast after lunch the previous day.  The wine list is extensive, and unless you can get through War and Peace in an afternoon, ignore it.  Go with the master's wine pairings.  We did this to avoid the wine list, but primarily to get a variety of wines that would complement the food.  The pairings are outstanding and well worth the price--all great quality.  A couple Of them I intend to put my wine merchant on the hunt for once we return home.  Now to the meal.  As mentioned above, prepare for an experience not just a meal.  There were at least three introductory dishes before the first appetizer course.  All were 3 bites at the most but the tastes were bliss.  Items that I would never have thought to put on the same plate, presented in an artistic fashion on custom shaped dish ware.  At this point, I already knew that the wine pairings was the correct route.  Through the next five courses, each split into multiple sub courses, probably 15-20 plates in all, we had experienced tastes that were just unbelievable.  This is not an inexpensive endeavor, but one would not expect it to be given the two Michelin stars and the Quality of the product.  Nonetheless, it was well worth it.  Please remember, reserve early and come hungry to avoid disappointment.",2014-11-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or210-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19506,0.046,0.839,0.115,0.9796,0.1239583333333333,0.4433407738095239,0.290725,2013,177,0.0879284649776453,0,54,False,65,0.1830985915492957,0.0985915492957746,0.2957746478873239,0.0422535211267605,0.0985915492957746,0.0,0.028169014084507,0.056338028169014,0.1690140845070422,0.028169014084507,358,213,4.550279329608938,0,0,outstand restaur get preliminari seat restaur one serv meal experi savor plan hour result reserv well advanc requir secur reserv time think prepar two side menu left la cart right chef tast menu need read left side right side experi resid three tast menu eas refer call small medium larg small mean eat lunch medium mean skip breakfast lunch larg mean start fast lunch previou day wine list extens unless get war peac afternoon ignor go master wine pair avoid wine list primarili get varieti wine would complement food pair outstand well worth price great qualiti coupl intend put wine merchant hunt return home meal mention prepar experi meal least three introductori dish first appet cours bite tast bliss item would never thought put plate present artist fashion custom shape dish ware point alreadi knew wine pair correct rout next five cours split multipl sub cours probabl plate experienc tast unbeliev inexpens endeavor one would expect given two michelin star qualiti product nonetheless well worth pleas rememb reserv earli come hungri avoid disappoint,very good review,5

Because we wanted a lighter lunch and of course not to spend too much, we chose the short menu and being a bit starstruck and I spoke for the table ""We just want the short menu"". The chef replied politely ""That's ok!"". I was satisfied, humbled and honoured by someone who truly loved and cared about his craft. I could only described our lunch experience by calling it a culinary adventure. Every bit was an unique experience that challenged our senses. Even the in house baked bread was as good as any top bakeries in Paris. The bread was so good that I ordered three even though I only wanted one to save room. My kids also had a great time not only because of the food, they were especially amused by the synchronized serving that resembled a dance move. At the end, we were completely satisfied and our lunch was simply the best meal we had during our two weeks stay in Spain. The experience was surprisingly down to earth given it's Michelin 2 stars status. e.g. I had two classes of wine (1 dry white and 1 dry red which I trusted the server to select), I was charged for an extremely reasonable 9 euros each with refill, as compared to recently that I was charged almost 60 pounds for 2 wines with similar quality at restaurant G.R. in Chelsea, England. With a meal so close to perfection, I would like to offer a few minor suggestions or comments: 1) With an Asian background, I could not help but the eat the Nori sitting below the Thai coconut even though it may be an garnish. I did find the Nori a bit stale. A Japanese chef once shows me that a quick roast of nori over open flame will bring it back to life. 2) Both the main courses Canelonni and Socarrat were flawless, but they were both very large portions. Somehow the table next to us knew to split the Socarrat to share for 2 people, and I thought it would make it perfect as I felt very quilty in wasting such fine food which lead me to overeat.",2017-04-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or100-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19516,0.022,0.853,0.125,0.9886,0.2137806637806637,0.4834054834054834,0.2985,2125,183,0.0861176470588235,1,48,False,79,0.1558441558441558,0.1688311688311688,0.3376623376623376,0.0649350649350649,0.1558441558441558,0.0,0.0129870129870129,0.0129870129870129,0.0649350649350649,0.0259740259740259,399,243,4.328320802005012,0,0,visit number michelin star restaur carri chef name would first time see master chef believ chef ramon go tabl took order want lighter lunch cours spend much chose short menu bit starstruck spoke tabl want short menu chef repli polit ok satisfi humbl honour someon truli love care craft could describ lunch experi call culinari adventur everi bit uniqu experi challeng sens even hous bake bread good top bakeri pari bread good order three even though want one save room kid also great time food especi amus synchron serv resembl danc move end complet satisfi lunch simpli best meal two week stay spain experi surprisingli earth given michelin star statu e g two class wine dri white dri red trust server select charg extrem reason euro refil compar recent charg almost pound wine similar qualiti restaur g r chelsea england meal close perfect would like offer minor suggest comment asian background could help eat nori sit thai coconut even though may garnish find nori bit stale japanes chef show quick roast nori open flame bring back life main cours canelonni socarrat flawless larg portion somehow tabl next us knew split socarrat share peopl thought would make perfect felt quilti wast fine food lead overeat,very good review,5

What we don't like is kitschy and something more cerebral than tasty. At first, reading up on Diverxo, I was worried this was more of the latter. But the menu and descriptions of the dishes sounded like foods we would enjoy, so we took a risk and booked a lunch during our visit in March 2013.  It was quite a bit out of the way, a train ride out to the suburbs. We got there early and spent 25 minutes wandering a half-empty mercado. When we were seated, they handed us this flier, printed on silver cardstock paper, that had some diatribe about embracing life and all it's unexpected surprises, something about a roller coaster taking you up and down and all around. Again, I was feeling a tad worried. There were also sculptures of flying pigs, with feathery wings, on every table. This did not worry me; they were very cute. The first dish came - wow, edamame! Really, not that wow, I eat bags of this stuff at home. But the sauce was interesting and so we dug in. Then came our utensils for our next course--a spatula! I wondered if they were going to make us make our own food, as part of the roller coaster ride. But instead we were instructed to eat with it, and we discovered that next to chopsticks, it was one of the most ingenious ways to eat. Spoons and fish knives were shamed. What followed were a series of beautifully plated, delicious courses, or rather canvases (they serve them on flat canvases, sometimes ""painting"" on the sauces). There was a little slightly briney seafood bouillabaise with small crab pile on the side, a fish covered in a light foie gras sauce, some kind of space-age looking dim sum dumpling with a carrot puree, a very weird but ultimately good combination of grilled squid and strawberry (roller coaster go down, weee!), a cod that was cooked and braised to imitate a hearty rabbit stew, and a piece of beef tongue that was slowly cooked for 8 hours (patience, young paduwan). Also, we should talk about the wine. It was lunch, so we wanted to keep it to a couple glasses each. I asked if I could start with a glass of white, and our sommelier (poor guy had to wear this silver shiny shirt) came by, opened a bottle, and placed it in an ice bucket. I thought I had mispoken and accidentally ordered a bottle! But after I finished my white, he came and asked if I would like a different glass of wine. Why, yes. So he opened up a red for me and poured a glass that paired excellently with my later courses. I was floored that they would open up bottles for their by-the-glass customers. Very nice, very classy. And very affordable! Each glass was about 6.5 Euro. I would definitely ride this roller coaster again.",2013-04-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7179537-Reviews-or130-DiverXO-Madrid.html,UID_19520,0.05,0.831,0.119,0.9925,0.1753439393939393,0.4973131313131313,0.4411516129032258,2904,249,0.0857438016528925,5,99,False,86,0.1485148514851485,0.1287128712871287,0.2772277227722772,0.0495049504950495,0.1287128712871287,0.0198019801980198,0.0297029702970297,0.0495049504950495,0.1287128712871287,0.0396039603960396,528,319,4.5,0,0,husband enjoy varieti food experi tasti buffalo wing bar food hole wall fanci pant local sourc eclect basic french american restaur ton new york like kitschi someth cerebr tasti first read diverxo worri latter menu descript dish sound like food would enjoy took risk book lunch visit march quit bit way train ride suburb got earli spent minut wander half empti mercado seat hand us flier print silver cardstock paper diatrib embrac life unexpect surpris someth roller coaster take around feel tad worri also sculptur fli pig featheri wing everi tabl worri cute first dish came wow edamam realli wow eat bag stuff home sauc interest dug came utensil next cours spatula wonder go make us make food part roller coaster ride instead instruct eat discov next chopstick one ingeni way eat spoon fish knive shame follow seri beauti plate delici cours rather canvas serv flat canvas sometim paint sauc littl slightli briney seafood bouillabais small crab pile side fish cover light foie gra sauc kind space age look dim sum dumpl carrot pure weird ultim good combin grill squid strawberri roller coaster go weee cod cook brais imit hearti rabbit stew piec beef tongu slowli cook hour patienc young paduwan also talk wine lunch want keep coupl glass ask could start glass white sommeli poor guy wear silver shini shirt came open bottl place ice bucket thought mispoken accident order bottl finish white came ask would like differ glass wine ye open red pour glass pair excel later cours floor would open bottl glass custom nice classi afford glass euro would definit ride roller coaster,good review,4

Most dishes have multiple elements served separately. The problem is that the more elaborate and interesting the presentation, the worse the taste. To be precise, most of what was served was barely edible. The three exceptions were the three simplest dishes: a 3-star veal shank, a 3-star fish soup (but not its contents or its side dishes), and various 3-star breads made in Barcelona by the chef's father. If the chef would (at the risk perhaps of losing favor with Michelin) reorient his cooking to the basics, he could have a 3-star restaurant; a reviewer once made the comment that a great dish at Taillevant was chicken cooked simply. As it is, in my opinion, he barely has a 1-star restaurant, and that only, in my experience, because of the three dishes mentioned above.",2014-09-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1810038-Reviews-or220-Ramon_Freixa_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_19531,0.067,0.869,0.065,0.3983,0.1749999999999999,0.5160714285714285,0.3472333333333333,922,73,0.079175704989154,0,33,False,30,0.074074074074074,0.074074074074074,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.037037037037037,0.0,0.1851851851851851,0.1481481481481481,0.1481481481481481,158,113,4.841772151898734,0,0,food michelin two star restaur ultra fanci instanc melt chees disguis rock print paper eaten dish multipl element serv separ problem elabor interest present wors tast precis serv bare edibl three except three simplest dish star veal shank star fish soup content side dish variou star bread made barcelona chef father chef would risk perhap lose favor michelin reorient cook basic could star restaur review made comment great dish taillev chicken cook simpli opinion bare star restaur experi three dish mention,good review,4

The maitre d' (from Bulgaria, unfortunately we drank a lot so forgot his name :) ) was one of the nicest people we have ever had a pleasure of meeting and we are very thankful for the treatment we have received. Everything we had was pretty amazing, but the suckling pig was out of this world!!! Super crispy and the meat was melt in your mouth tender. The menu does lie a little bit, as we were expecting a ~9 course menu, and in the end we got 15+ courses. We were definitely ready to blow up in the end! The bread is made by Ramon's father in Barcelona and they ship it via high speed train daily....the butter bread was completely addictive!!! Another unique things about this restaurant is that the dinner order was taken by Ramon himself...how often do you see that in fine dining???

We decided to do something special for my parents 50th wedding anniversary, so we made a reservation for 10, since my brother wanted to join in the celebrations with his family. For starters they said that to take our reservations we must adhere to an specific predefined meal, without being able to select anything from the menu or wine list. That should have been enough of a signal, yet since we wanted to treat our parents to a special occasion, we agreed. The day that we had made the reservation my mother (72 years of age) came down with food poisoning and we called to see if we could move the date. They said no, and that they would charge the full amount, if we did not show. Making a great effort we made it arriving 20 minutes late. To our surprise they said they would not honor the full menu and could only serve 2/3 of it, just because we made it 20 minutes late. They did not care my mother had made a great effort just to show up. We insisted that we should be served the full menu, despite talking with the maître and asking to talk to a supervisor they served 2/3 of the proposed menu and included 2 - 16 euro bottles of wine for 10 people. Food was not extraordinary and included pasta and meatballs which frankly you could get at any NY deli for 1/3 the price and as good or better quality.

The dining room is beautiful, with large windows onto a patio/garden.

Everything has been thought of carefully here so that your entire experience, visually as well as senses and tastes, is pure bliss. Our menu was well balanced with many delicious ""beginnings"" such as breaded seaweed, melon with capers but it was the ball of foie that exploded in my mouth that stays with me and yes, the bread is superb but then so was the confit suckling pig and the red mullet.... and on it goes. The cheese dish was one of the most interesting presentations of excellent cheeses I have had the occasion to try.  Ramon Freixa took the orders and I agree, it is nice to know the chef is ""home"".

Your palate is in for a treat at this place. What impressed me most of all is that Ramon himself is present. Not off giving lectures in China or making a reality TV show. He is constantly wandering from the kitchen into the small (7 or 8 tables) dining room, conversing with his diners, making sure everyone is happy, etc.  The service is probably the finest I have seen anywhere. A small wait staff of 4 young, impeccably dressed (NOT white shirts and black pants, but rather blue blazers, ties, khakis) men. This dining room runs like a well oiled machine. Not a beat is missed, these guys are PROFESSIONAL. They all work all of the tables, so you get a chance to chat with all four of them. One recommended a fantastic Spanish white wine that was perfect. The food is presented so perfectly that is practically tells a story, and the flavors and combinations are simply divine. All in all, the tasting menu spans the horizon of food groups, flavors, textures and colors.  I have eaten in many fine establishments around the world, Michelin starred and not.

It was our last night in Madrid and the reviews for La Mi Venta convinced us to give it a try. I booked the reservation online and requested The Cave, their underground cellar which has room for only five or six tables. We were seated promptly when we arrived and the service was great - very polite, helpful, and thankfully spoke English well as our Spanish is mediocre on a good day. We started with grilled vegetables and a bottle of wine. We each ordered an entree (steak for me, lamb chops for her) and finished with their chocolate mousse and their complimentary liqueur to wrap everything up.

That first night we ordered a drink first & it came with a delicious tapa of tuna. We ended up staying for another drink & ordered mixed pinchos to share. Couldn't believe it when the slate platter was brought over. Hake with caramelised onions, tuna with sweet tomatoes, lomo with mushrooms, & pate with goats cheese. Best pinchos ever! So it became our ""local"" restaurant during our stay in Madrid. Although we ate other places too (& had some very good food), we did return to La Mi Venta another twice. We never reserved, and we always sat outside (reservation is pretty much essential for inside), and we were not dsappointed with any of the food. The main dishes are as well thought out & prepared as the tapas, the wines were good, and the waiters were so friendly but really knew their jobs too - a very well run little restaurant. One I would recommend to anyone I knew who was going to be in Madrid.",2016-05-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or660-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_12804,0.014,0.862,0.124,0.9728,0.1994348659003831,0.4285249042145594,0.3732999999999999,1269,112,0.0882584712371946,2,42,False,60,0.1864406779661017,0.2033898305084746,0.3220338983050847,0.0508474576271186,0.2033898305084746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0338983050847457,0.0,237,157,4.358649789029536,0,0,unassum litr restaur tabl pavement minut hotel tire hungri first night sat outsid drink could plan go eat glad later look trip advisor pleas found without outsid help first night order drink first came delici tapa tuna end stay anoth drink order mix pincho share believ slate platter brought hake caramelis onion tuna sweet tomato lomo mushroom pate goat chees best pincho ever becam local restaur stay madrid although ate place good food return la mi venta anoth twice never reserv alway sat outsid reserv pretti much essenti insid dsappoint food main dish well thought prepar tapa wine good waiter friendli realli knew job well run littl restaur one would recommend anyon knew go madrid,very good review,5

Ramón Freixa didn’t deliver what a 2 stars Michelin suppose to offer. I read other reviews and agreed the servers were arrogant, they speak so fast with their accent and didn’t ask for feedback when food were not finished on plates because we didn’t like it. The restaurant opened at 9, we ordered the shorter tasting menu with 20 dishes and we were too sleepy and ask all desserts to come out at once and yet we still couldn’t leave the restaurant until 12:30!!! The table next to us also kept asking how many course was left mid-way of the dinner, by the time we almost finish you can tell most customers were too sleepy and didn’t even bother to make conversation to others on the table. I also agreed with other reviews that only 1-2 dishes were memorable while the rest was disappointing.

Bread and an outstanding olive oil provided, followed by a ham soup amuse-bouche. Our waiter Julio spoke superb english and was a credit to the restaurant. He explained the menu and made excellent recommendations. His knowledge was excellent. We picked the traditional tapas to share and then the iberico pork from the grill, also to share. It was outstanding, unlike anything you can get at home. Tapas were generous and very authentic, a real treat. Appreciated that Julio advised us how much to order otherwise we would definitely have overordered! Shared an amazing dessert, which was totally unique. Bread, tapas, main and a dessert all for under 50 euros, so excellent value for the quality and service we received.

Gambas was also a great dish to taste good quality shrimp. 이 곳을 방문했을 때 독감으로 한 창 고생할 때라 몸 상태가 말이 아니였다. 원래 술을 좋아하는 나였지만 이 날 만큼은 안먹을 생각이었으나, Edu의 감바스에 마실 것 하나 하는 게 좋지않겠냐는 말에 그럴 것 같아서 무난해보이는 모히또를 주문했었다. 모히또는 정말 맛있었지만 생각보다 도수가 쎈 탓에 2모금 정도 마셨나? 이후 손도 못대고 있었더니 그걸 본 Edu가 자신이 만든 모히또가 맛없냐고 물어왔고, 사정을 설명해줬다. 다 듣고 난 Edu는 되려 자신이 미안하다며 다른 술로 바꿔주겠다고 했고 나는 추천을 해달랬더니 샹그리아를 추천해주더라. 아니 방금 술 많이 못마실 것 같은 상태랬는데 뭐지 싶었으나 Edu는 샹그리아가 매우 약한 술이니 괜찮을거랬고 난 믿어보기로했다. 잠시 후 나온 샹그리아는 보기도 너무 이쁘게 데코돼있었고, 술이 약한 걸 감안해 일부러 그렇게 제조한 건지 원래 그렇게 나오는 건지 모르겠으나 오렌지주스를 반 섞어서 알콜 도수가 거의 안느껴질정도로 제조해주었다. 결과적으로 이 곳은 칵테일이 정말 끝내주고 데코도 너무 이쁘며 같이 먹은 감바스는 조금 짜지만 함께 나온 빵과 함께 먹으니 간이 잘 맞았고 새우의 질이 매우 좋아 그 탱글한 식감이 매우 감동적이었다. 그리고 이 모든 것들에 최고의 서비스가 곁들여져 그저 길 가다 들린 사람에게도 기분좋은 식사 시간을 선물해준다. 위치는 소피아 여왕 국립미술관 근처라 그 일정있는 날 들리면 좋을 것 같다.",2017-08-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8396325-Reviews-or1090-Taberna_Mas_Al_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_19627,0.0,0.929,0.071,0.944,0.5750000000000001,0.6333333333333334,0.1049,891,12,0.0134680134680134,2,20,False,8,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,215,191,3.1488372093023256,0,0,edu chupi rememb name exactli best staff impress edu delic servic gamba also great dish tast good qualiti shrimp edu edu edu edu,very good review,5

Unfortunately on the day of our visit my wife was just recovering from her stomach illness, and she was only able to nibble food. The restaurant has nice basement premises for dinner customers.  As a starter I decided to order something small – so I ordered Grilled Goat Cheese Salad over Fresh Apple Jam. The salad was tasty, but absolutely oversized for one person. Even for two persons it might be a decent challenge.  My mains - Acorn Fed 100% Iberian Grilled with Natural Carbon was also delicious but also too big. Luckily my dessert - Chocolate Mousse with Almonds Crisp and Pistachio Ice Cream - was of reasonable size. As a digestive I ordered coffee with brandy. Unfortunately the warm-up process of the brandy glass took so long that when it finally arrived I had finished my coffee. So I was alone with my (plentiful amount of) brandy.

From the reception and choice of menu guided by Ramon in person, to the petit fours. I have been to many Michelin starred restaurants and I come from the place in the world with the highest ratio per person, still sometimes it is not what you would expect. In this case, the food was all surprising and delicious, special mention to the cooked cheeses, an original and delightful deviation from the traditional French cheese platter. Desserts were marvellous too, I suggest to skip the bread to be able to fit it all! Excellent wine choices. The highs and lows of the menu: The fish was very well prepared but the type of fish chosen happens to be my least favourite so that was a bit of a shame. Some of the food explanations are said so quickly that is hard to follow. The bread was the only questionable thing we were served. On one hand, the butter bread, a brioche style bread was delicious, but really heavy and probably more appropriate for a breakfast than for a dinner that has 7 dishes after it (after the bread) the other types of bread were really average and not at the level of the rest of the food.

The food was very good, but what really set the restaurant apart for us was the service and the presentation of the food.  Watching the servers carry out each course was like watching a well orchestrated play. These guys were completely in sync and really knew what they were doing! There must have been at least 4-5 people who were serving us throughout the night and they were all very sweet and very charming.  I think we must have sampled 25-30 separate items throughout our meal, not including the wine paring. The presentation of each was so creative and imaginative. The most memorable for me were the tomato salad served over liquid ice, the Tarantino inspired brain dessert, and the manchego cheese mimetic stone. Everything was tasty. My taste buds were most impressed with the red mullet served over what I would describe as a seaweed bisque.  The restaurant is part of a Hotel Unico (which looked amazing from the lobby) and is in a posh part of Madrid. The meal is pretty pricey but oh so worth it.

My wife often joins me on my “working vacations” and this time, we had three nights in Madrid. One of my First Officers told me that a “self-proclaimed Foodie” flight attendant highly recommended La Mi Venta, just an 8 minute walk from our hotel. So when I saw the great reviews on TA, I knew we would eat there at least one night, probably our first. The restaurant doesn’t open until 8PM and we arrived around 8:10. We were given a very good cup of beef broth when we arrived, without a reservation and it was perfect after pausing in the park on our way to play with the walked local dogs. It was pretty cold and the broth was a soothing, warming beginning. We were seated downstairs and the setting was beautiful. My only recommendation would be to dim the lighting a bit. Our waiter was friendly, gracious and spoke impeccable English. We asked his recommendations and for a starter, he recommended the Acorn-Fed 100% Iberico Ham. He said the restaurant was famous for that. Done. For a main, he recommended any of the MEATS. My wife was in more of a fish mood, so she ordered the Cod Loin Coated in Tempura. After a late lunch, I wasn’t terribly hungry so I ordered the Beef Truffled Hamburger, Medium Rare. We also ordered a bottle wine, a Protos, Ribera del Duero Riserva 2012. WOW! If you enjoy full-bodied reds, with a bit of tannin, reasonably priced, you’ll LOVE that wine.  Before the starter came, our waiter poured a bit of EVOO to enjoy with our bread. It was medium-green in color and as an admitted olive oil snob, I have to say it was one of the best EVOO’s we have had at a restaurant in Europe. (Check out “freshpressedoliveoil.com”) The favorite part of our meal was the Olive Oil and the wine. But from there, things were not as pleasant. My wife’s Cod, in my opinion was very good. Three pieces, about an inch and a half square, deep fried (?) and placed atop a spoonful of mashed potatoes. The fish was hot, flaky and good. But definitely not a gourmet dish. Reminded me of a really good chain seafood restaurant. Good, but not OMG!. My Beef Truffled Hamburger was interesting but not in a good way. It was tender, juicy yet overcooked for my taste so don’t take the temperature as too much of a guide.  The taste/mouthfeel was...different. I LOVE a good burger and this wasn’t one I would order aging. (BTW...when in Madrid, look for Goiko Burger. A “fast” food chain and DELICIOUS!. Perfect place for a take-away. So here’s our bottom line on La Mi Venta... I MAY go back to try a meat entree. When I walked past the grill on the main floor, the steaks cooking there looked and smelled DELICIOUS. The Iberico Ham Starter was really good. I’m not an expert on that, so I would have to defer to someone who is. The beef broth upon arrival was above and beyond. The atmosphere was beautiful. Just dim the lights a bit. And we probably ordered the wrong mains. It appears that their best mains if Meat. So will I return? Probably. If only for the Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Protos wine.",2018-01-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or370-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_19646,0.027,0.803,0.17,0.9982,0.3285384615384616,0.5960256410256413,0.4253142857142857,3154,270,0.0856055802155992,3,104,False,114,0.146788990825688,0.1743119266055046,0.2935779816513761,0.073394495412844,0.2110091743119266,0.0091743119266055,0.0,0.0,0.0642201834862385,0.0275229357798165,577,335,4.464471403812825,0,0,intern airlin pilot great privileg abl dine restaur europ south america wife often join work vacat time three night madrid one first offic told self proclaim foodi flight attend highli recommend la mi venta minut walk hotel saw great review ta knew would eat least one night probabl first restaur open pm arriv around given good cup beef broth arriv without reserv perfect paus park way play walk local dog pretti cold broth sooth warm begin seat downstair set beauti recommend would dim light bit waiter friendli graciou spoke impecc english ask recommend starter recommend acorn fed iberico ham said restaur famou done main recommend meat wife fish mood order cod loin coat tempura late lunch terribl hungri order beef truffl hamburg medium rare also order bottl wine proto ribera del duero riserva wow enjoy full bodi red bit tannin reason price love wine starter came waiter pour bit evoo enjoy bread medium green color admit oliv oil snob say one best evoo restaur europ check freshpressedoliveoil com favorit part meal oliv oil wine thing pleasant wife cod opinion good three piec inch half squar deep fri place atop spoon mash potato fish hot flaki good definit gourmet dish remind realli good chain seafood restaur good omg beef truffl hamburg interest good way tender juici yet overcook tast take temperatur much guid tast mouthfeel differ love good burger one would order age btw madrid look goiko burger fast food chain delici perfect place take away bottom line la mi venta may go back tri meat entre walk past grill main floor steak cook look smell delici iberico ham starter realli good expert would defer someon beef broth upon arriv beyond atmospher beauti dim light bit probabl order wrong main appear best main meat return probabl extra virgin oliv oil proto wine,good review,4

We had read so many great things that we prioritized it as a ""must visit"". Following a visit to Monasterio de las Descalzus Reales we walked to La Mi Venta which is close by and also recommended by one of the staff at the Monasterio. We did not have a reservation but were immediately seated in the ""Cave"", a quaint adorable dining room in the basement. Two other couples and a large party of 13 were also eventually seated reaching the room's capacity. CC ordered 1 Emina Verdejo Rue(3,10) and I ordered 1 Aqua Vichy(3,60) and eventually2 Copa Casa Cerveza(7,0). We decided to split an order of Calamares a la Ro(13,30). The calamari was cooked just a bit too long but still very good-not the best and certainly not the worst. CC opted for the Bacalao Rebozado(19,50), a Cod Loin Coated in Tempura with minced Peppers and Sherry Vinegar. This dish was perfectly presented and cooked but over breaded. My selection was the Grilled Entrecot ordered medium rare(20,50). Again the rib steak was perfectly cooked as ordered and expertly presented. It was partly one of the best steaks I have ever had but also part of it too tough due to the sinew,which was a disappointment.

Restaurant has two opening times each day, 1-4.30pm and 8-11.30pm, there is a small ground floor seating area as well as lower level seating. Outdoor seating was available on the day we visited as well.  Dining environment is nice, worth dressing up if you enjoy nice dining. However, casual attire seemed to be just fine during our lunch, which is convenient on hot summer days if you've been out sightseeing all morning. Restaurant is not far from Palacio Real, just across the street from Jardines de Sabatini.  During our lunch, we enjoyed a plate of the Iberian acorn fed ham, Chorizo from Hell and Manchego Goat Cheese, which was more then enough food for two diners. The ham was very, very good - salty but slightly sweet and the fat just melted in your mouth. The cheese complemented the ham quite well and the chorizo was succulent, not as hot as we expected but with produced lots of flavour.  Server helped us choose a local wine which we enjoyed. We shared and enjoyed a chocolate mouse with pistachio gelato dessert as well.  Overall, everything was very good at La Mi Venta, which proved to be one of the best meals we had in Madrid.

Last year we went to a 3 Michelin starred French restaurant, but without doubt this experience was way better! The restaurant is small, intimate and beautifully decorated. One sits at small tables in the covered garden area with aperitifs and one's menu and Ramon himself comes out to each table and talks over what choices and preferences you'd like - a really nice touch! We selected the Territory tasting menu with complementary wines and were delighted we had! Every dish that was presented to us was beautifully presented and exquisitely cooked! There is a sense of fun in how several of the dishes were presented, which never detracted from the taste and flavour, but made one anticipate the next dish! I could not fault anything we ate, from starter selections to desserts. The complementary wines the sommelier selected were perfect for each dish - highly recommend doing this! The overall service was exemplary from start to finish - excellent! Ramon comes around a couple of times, during the evening, to ensure every table is happy with everything, and they even presented my wife with a quirky little cake to celebrate her birthday!

From the minute we entered (quite under-dressed in the hiking clothes we had been wearing that day) we were treated like friends and felt welcome. Note to future guests: I wouldn't recommend the hiking clothes, but if you have nothing else to wear you needn't worry one bit ;) Ramon Freixa personally came to welcome us and take our order... a gesture I really appreciated. And all of his staff, from the lady at the reception to the sommelier were very friendly and -more importantly- extremely competent in their jobs. This was one of the most impeccable services I have seen in all of my Michelin-inspired culinary experiences. The dishes were delicious, creative compositions with wonderful textures, and gorgeous presentation. The wine pairings for our menu were very good as well; their sommelier is extremely knowledgeable and willing to give as much information as needed. Another highlight was the bread, which Ramon ""imports"" from his father's restaurant in Barçelona. All in all a wonderful experience... this place definitely deserves its 2 Michelin stars in my opinion. The price for two tasting menus, wine flights, and water and cava to begin was very fair (EUR 500), and I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Madrid. If I had to critique something, I would have to say that the interior was a bit too much for my taste, but that is a very personal thing.

The chef welcome us at the entrance. I was little bit hesitant when I heard the resturant is the part of the Hotel, But the ambiance, and the atmosphere is so well done that you never feel unconfortable. There are few tables which is well enough for such an restaurant. Decoration is very modern and good. Wall has an panaromic view of Madrid that you feel at the top of high rise building looking towards the city. I don't like heavy meals with full of souce and cream. All Michelin star restaurans, that I tried, have such heavy dishes. We ordered tasting dishes. The waiter, full of kind and smiley behaviour, advised us the small set where we were all thanked him a lot in the end. Tasting dishes are very artisticly designed, full of color, shape and taste harmony.The tasting wines were so coherent with the dishes. Shape and content as well as all side dishes never gives you a clue about the taste of the dishes. For example when you swallow pebble (!), a volcano explode in your mouth. I really enjoyed to taste the creations of Mr.Ramon. The price are high, but I never even thought about that. I absolutely reccoment the restaurnt to my friends.
