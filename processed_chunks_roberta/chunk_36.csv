We ordered the salmon appetizer which was very tasty, although quite pricy— 18 euros, for the size of the portion. We ordered the seafood and chicken paella dishes for four people. Given the high price of each — 26-28 euros per person for a total of 110 euros, and the favorable online reviews, we were expecting dishes with sizable portions of seafront and chicken.. Unfortunately, there was a minimal amount of each in each dish, and the “paella” tasted more like fried rice. Certainly, the two dishes of paella did not come close to justifying the cost of 110 euros.

This beautiful hidden gem will leave you glowing with happiness when you leave. From the moment you walk in the staff are extremely nice and accommodating. Throughout your meal, they will constantly check in on you to make sure you are satisfied with your meal. Furthermore, they are extremely nice and love to meet customers! Throughout my meal I was able to get to know each of the waiters personally, the manager Eduardo, the owner Norberto, the original owner Carmin (now 92 years old but as sweet as ever), and was even invited to come back to meet the chefs and watch them make paella.  On top of amazing and personal service, Casa Benigna serves incredible food. Their signature dish is the paella which sticks to the pan, giving the rice a nice crispy taste and wonderful flavor. Regardless of what you order here you will leave satisfied as the portion sizes are large and come with a variety of fresh side dishes.  I cannot stress enough how great this restaurant is.

Norberto, the owner is warm, explains his philosophy for building a team dedicated to great food and service. Paella is the menu focus. We had a smoked salmon appetizer which had been marinated in herbs and then smoked, which had a great flavor. The tomatico(bruschetta), which was very flavorful. Four of us ordered two paella dishes, chicken and then seafood. The homemade, assorted bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar was outstanding. We met Norberto's beautiful granddaughter and his 92 year-old mother who is elegant and beautiful.

Owner Javier and his wife have an amazing thing going here - craft brews from all over Europe (and some from the US) in both draft and bottle form. Best of all, the owner has some of his own beers for purchase! Must say, his are some of the most original beers I've ever had - and they taste great too! An IPA brewed with mustard, and a brown ale (very tactfully) brewed with hot pepper. Highly recommended that you order their homemade beers if you go in. We had them in bottles, but they mentioned that occasionally they also have them on tap. Either way, worth a visit simply to have their stuff.

We walked in at about 2 o'clock, planning on having one or two drinks; ended up staying for 5 hours and truly having an afternoon to remember! The selection of beer was magnificent. 7 varied taps, a fridge full of Spanish beer, and a fridge full of international beers. Between the 3 of us we must have shared about 17 beers after deciding to try as many as we could after our initial couple. We tried all sorts from sours, to stouts, to IPA's, to barley wines; all lovely. While we were there the very friendly bar lady kept us well nourished with stunning coconut peanuts, cream cheese and olives. She also let us choose our own songs on the stereo which made the experience that bit more special. It is owned by a very pleasant family who came along in the evening and chatted to us. We loved the whole time we spent in there. If we're ever in Madrid again we'll be sure to pop in and have a few more beers!

It’s in a rather unprepossessing, working-class neighborhood, and we were a bit disconcerted when the taxi driver let us out in what looked like the middle of nowhere. But the low rents in that area allow the owner to put his money totally into the food and into his customer’s experience. We had the meal of a life-time here. The specialty is a rather unusual, dry paella. But other dishes off the menu were stupendous, too. The smoked salmon (which is smoked right there in the kitchen as it’s being grilled for you) was to die for. The eggplant was cooked perfectly. We loved the blood sausage, too, even though it’s something we never would order—it was a complimentary dish. The chocolate mousse-like dessert was fabulous. This was one of the best meals we’ve had in years, and it was made more special because the owner stopped off at our table to chat several times, and eventually invited us back into the kitchen to meet the staff and enjoy a glass of free cava. I doubt he has the time to do that every night, but it was obvious that he’s devoted his life to his restaurant and loves to enhance his customers’ experience, and it shows.

I've eaten, and I've cooked paella, but nothing compares to this. Some may get a shock when they say that the finished dish is flat, a thin layer of crispy, succulent, delicious rice, with small bits of seafood/poultry/whatever your choose, spread throughout - not huge pieces on top of the dish. But oh my, it is just the best we've ever eaten, including mine! It's balanced in flavour, delicate yet almost robust and not overpowering with saffron, and just melt in your mouth. As I say, small serving, but that's all you need. The delivery and serving is a treat: the waiter scrapes the pan, gets all the crunchy bits mixed into the whole, and Voila! there it is. The team are surprisingly all Filipino, no problem then with efficiency and happy attitude. The maitre d' is super efficient, no messing around or delays here. So don't expect a leisurely, romantic meal: this is a serious foody restaurant - with an excellent wine selection. Try the asparagus entree (yummy), and their home made olive oil with the delicious bread: just leave room for the paella.",2018-02-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991647-Reviews-or30-Casa_Benigna-Madrid.html,UID_30614,0.044,0.7,0.257,0.9958,0.2333333333333333,0.5682539682539682,0.403990909090909,1189,86,0.0723296888141295,2,49,False,32,0.1323529411764706,0.1029411764705882,0.25,0.1029411764705882,0.1323529411764706,0.0441176470588235,0.0147058823529411,0.0588235294117647,0.1176470588235294,0.0441176470588235,205,152,4.804878048780488,0,0,thank travel tip chose special paella restaur other paid us back perfect eaten cook paella noth compar may get shock say finish dish flat thin layer crispi succul delici rice small bit seafood poultri whatev choos spread throughout huge piec top dish oh best ever eaten includ mine balanc flavour delic yet almost robust overpow saffron melt mouth say small serv need deliveri serv treat waiter scrape pan get crunchi bit mix whole voila team surprisingli filipino problem effici happi attitud maitr super effici mess around delay expect leisur romant meal seriou foodi restaur excel wine select tri asparagu entre yummi home made oliv oil delici bread leav room paella,good review,4

I am usually sceptical for ""great pizza"" and when I go to such a place I always order pizza margherita because with very few ingredients it needs to be really well made in order to taste right. This place has got it. The dough is very good, thin and crispy, otherwise it was perfectly made and served as soon as it came out. Ensalata Caprese as well: has to be extra fresh for it to stand out. They had some very tasty tomatoes and the basil was fresh and had the right taste. Deserts were not particularly special, I skipped as I was full but only tried from friends.  Service is quick, not particularly friendly but professional: the place was packed, and I think it usually is. They take orders fast, bring the food and came by once to see if we wanted more drinks etc.  Decoration, well its a matter of taste, I did not find it particularly engaging but we were lucky to sit at the only table at the window at street level, so we had a lot of nice bright light.

Casa Benigna is THAT good.  Pulled up TripAdvisor app and starting searching “Paella” as we were having craving for real authentic Spanish food. 550 5xstars ratings and lots of good reviews and coincidentally 5 min walk from my hotel. We went searching for Casa Benigna.  If not for Google maps, we would never have noticed it was a restaurant behind that inconspicuous huge wooden door along a residential street.  Tapped the iron knob a couple of times and we were greeted by a very friendly staff (Ryan) who told us this place is “reservation only” much to our dismay. I tried to plea for a corner table as we were hungry but were politely turned down. Left my number and made a reservation for next day lunch.  15min later as we were still walking around the neighbourhood looking for food (and restaurants with English menus), the phone rang and Ryan was on the line. Someone cancelled and he could take us! Wow!!! He bothered to call us back...! Fast Forward. Casa Benigna is decorated like a traditional Spanish home with books and photo frames donning every corner of the place. Starters were delicious bread, biscuits, chips (real thick potato pieces) and salads. The Olives and Avocado cream were fresh.  They gave a bucket (yes a large bucket!) of home made butter to go with everything.  Finally the Seafood Paella recommended by Ryan was the best meal this trip, probably better than any Paella we’ve had before. The seafood was painstakingly chopped into pieces and the rice done to perfection.  This place is a 100% must try when you are in Madrid. The Paella, The Ambience and The Service - .

I do not normally open a review so strongly, but this was the best meal of our ten days in Spain. It was not only a meal, but an experience - perfect for a couple looking for a quiet and unique night together. We will stay with the door. At first we thought that maybe our Uber driver has made a mistake. The restaurant facade is so unassuming, and the door was locked. Using the knocker, the friendly staff opened the door to a unique and charming establishment. Each table has some unique decorations that make it special. Our table was set and waiting for us, not only with place settings but with the start of our first course - beads and olives. Olive oil, balsamic, and French butter soon followed. The next course was a small bowl of vegetable and cod soup. It was lovely, and included in the 6€ per person cover charge, as was the bread. Next we had our starter. We chose the herring. The marinated herring had a more subtle flavor than we get in the USA, and the variety of toppings made each piece a unique treat. Both paellas we ordered were excellent. The seafood and the Iberian pork paellas had the right mix of smoky and savory, and the rice was cooked to perfection. Each bite was an absolute pleasure. Our meal concluded with light sparkling wine and smooth hot chocolate, even without having ordered dessert. As if this amazing meal was not enough, I was invited back into the kitchen by Norberto, the owner. There I met the chefs who cooked our culinary experience. They were enthusiastic and clearly used to meeting the customers. Norberto and I chatted as if we were old friends. We talked about business, my home state of Massachusetts, and life in Spain. We hadva wonderful night at Casa Benigna, and I will 100% return when I am next in Madrid.

The place is small and the tables are always packed and there is usually a wait of about 30 minutes to an hour to get a table. Unfortunately they do not take reservations. The staff was helpful and friendly and clearly the best time to have dinner here is during lunchtime where they serve their daily specials. For under eight euros you can have a drink, an appetizer and a main meal with At least three options to pick from. It was definitely a good value and the taste of all the dishes without sanding.

They are using exiting culinary dishes like black rice (normally with squids) into an incredible tasty dish and with an amazing texture. The vegan ‘tiramisu’ was much better (and lighter) than the so-called ‘real thing’. If you have any doubt still that non meat options can be more delicious than meat-based cooking, then you need to go to Vega. With starter, main couse, desert, coffee and 2 glasses of organic wine it came up to 27 Euros. Few Euros more than a standard evening meal in Madrid but not outrageous.

This is some of the less creative vegan food we found in Madrid, which was frankly very welcome! We shared the aperitif style starter with dips and nuts, look out for the bread-this was particularly tasty, the waiter told us it comes in from a bakery out of town daily-well worthwhile. Then I enjoyed the chilli and my partner had the curry which were both really great. For dessert he had the tiramisu, which was probably the best vegan version we’ve had anywhere, and I had the crumble which is hands down the best vegan dessert in Madrid. All in all some top quality but pretty regular vegan food which went down a storm after some delicious, but also pretty whacky vegan food elsewhere in Madrid (including a lot of raw stuff!) highly recommend.

The portions are really generous and really well priced considering the quality of the food.  During a lunch date, my partner and I shared a salad and chickpea stew, both were gorgeous. Very flavorsome and filling without being over facing.  We ended up visiting the restaurant in the evening without making a reservation (I would definitely make a reservation in the future) and the staff set us up at the bar. We shared the 'seafood' (asparagus and rice cooked with nori) and roast vegetables. It was absolutely beautiful, very clean, fresh and flavorsome. After the meal Vega were even kind enough to package up two vegan desserts for us to take home.",2018-03-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7384845-Reviews-or100-Vega-Madrid.html,UID_26401,0.015,0.767,0.217,0.9899,0.3204166666666667,0.5771875000000001,0.5341666666666667,918,71,0.0773420479302832,0,20,False,48,0.0,0.32,0.4,0.04,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,162,114,4.660493827160494,0,0,vega fantast chill restaur bar close transport link madrid gluten free vegan place great place eat visit vega twice recent trip madrid could prais food servic highli enough portion realli gener realli well price consid qualiti food lunch date partner share salad chickpea stew gorgeou flavorsom fill without face end visit restaur even without make reserv would definit make reserv futur staff set us bar share seafood asparagu rice cook nori roast veget absolut beauti clean fresh flavorsom meal vega even kind enough packag two vegan dessert us take home,good review,4

This restaurant is known for their paella, which didn't disappoint. It's a small cute place. The owner is a charming guy who sings quite beautifully and greats you at the door. He introduces his mother who is there every day. She actually lives upstairs. He was extremely gracious and gave me a tour of the kitchen. It was immaculate, which of course, I was happy to see. We had the seafood paella and the meat (ribs and ham) paella. Both were really good. I enjoyed the meat paella slightly better as I found the seafood paella slightly oily. One thing to take note of is that they charge you for the accoutrements (bread, olive oil, carrots/celery). I point this out as they were brought to the table like most restaurants do and we assumed they were complimentary. We did not know there was a charge for them until we received our bill. I do have issue with providing something and not telling the customer there is a charge and giving them an option to decline.  I will say all in all it was a great experience.

Having spent the day being a tourist we wanted a nice local restaurant and this restaurant didn't fail. It was tucked down a couple of back streets and you would have missed it if it hadn't been for the olive trees either side of the large wooden front door. From the moment you entered you were made to feel welcome. The menu was in Spanish but the waiter translated it very well for us. There were three in our party and we chose to have a tapas style starter which consisted of smoked salmon, tomatoes with catfish sauce and a mushroom dish, followed by their signature paella chicken and vegetable and a trio dessert which was to share.

Believe the reviews that warn you not to be concerned by location or facade. Indeed you knock on the front door and enter a family's restaurant that is warm and inviting. The chef owner's mother sits at a small table just inside greeting all new guests, makes a walk around the tables to ensure you are happy and then bids you farewell on the way out. Then there's the paella! Incredible with the crusty crispy bottom and garlic aioli and fresh lemon condiments which light up the meal! Service is kind and warm.

He said, you are family here and always welcome back... and we will be back. I would visit Madrid again just to have another meal as Casa Benigna. Unfortunately the owner and master chef was away on other business as we read in Fodor's about his welcoming and charming personality. However on a special note we were able to meet his mother which was really a very special treat for us. We love and cherish moments where owners, their employees and family members make a real genuine show of their devotion to their craft. , The owner, Don Norberro's charm and personality has been immersed by his entire staff. Eduano made the evening one of our best ever as he explained the mastery behind the restaurant, and showed us the many winning awards and certifications that their owner has been given. He explained the magic behind their fabulous Paella; and displayed the quality ingredients that they use. They spare no expense from the custom made dinner wares, to the charmingly decorated interior with whites and blues. They only have 8 to 10 tables so, make a reservation in advance; we did so through our hotel Gran Melia Fenix the day before. Hands down this is the best food we have had in Spain, and we've been here for two weeks and have been using Fodor's, trip adviser and local concierges for research. YOU HAVE TO GET THE PAELLA - it is incredible. Of special note - we took a taxi to the restaurant and when we turned up the street it was a little sketchy and we we're early (830 pm) which is early for dinner in Spain. Most people eat out starting at 10 pm. It is required to knock on the door, and they will answer it, like you're calling on a friend or family member... it's truly charming and sets the tone for the entire evening. I could go on and on about the small details but trust us, if your're a foodie and derive great pleasure from award winning service and pleasurable delectable ingredients, than this is a MUST for you. Please tell Eduano Nick and Amber from San Francisco say hi, and we hope to be back soon.",2014-06-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991647-Reviews-or220-Casa_Benigna-Madrid.html,UID_11161,0.007,0.796,0.197,0.9976,0.3015925229741019,0.5717000835421889,0.3984705882352941,2124,188,0.0885122410546139,0,54,False,64,0.0816326530612244,0.1632653061224489,0.3163265306122449,0.0816326530612244,0.1632653061224489,0.0204081632653061,0.0408163265306122,0.0306122448979591,0.0510204081632653,0.0510204081632653,390,250,4.448717948717949,0,0,summari visit best explain someth eduano host said us said famili alway welcom back back would visit madrid anoth meal casa benigna unfortun owner master chef away busi read fodor welcom charm person howev special note abl meet mother realli special treat us love cherish moment owner employe famili member make real genuin show devot craft owner norberro charm person immers entir staff eduano made even one best ever explain masteri behind restaur show us mani win award certif owner given explain magic behind fabul paella display qualiti ingredi use spare expens custom made dinner ware charmingli decor interior white blue tabl make reserv advanc hotel gran melia fenix day hand best food spain two week use fodor trip advis local concierg research get paella incred special note took taxi restaur turn street littl sketchi earli pm earli dinner spain peopl eat start pm requir knock door answer like call friend famili member truli charm set tone entir even could go small detail trust us foodi deriv great pleasur award win servic pleasur delect ingredi must pleas tell eduano nick amber san francisco say hi hope back soon,very good review,5

So glad we did! It's the perfect European-style lunch joint (although I'm sure it would be nice and cozy for dinner too) where you can just point and choose off the menu or from the selection of tempting empanadas on display. It is a proper small casual restaurant with nice setting and table service though and not a deli, which just makes for a more relaxing experience. We ended up getting a full meal with glasses of beer and house wine (olives were served with the aperitif), empanadas for starters, a big salad (the best I had in Spain in terms of taste and ingredients) and cold cuts platter and then we ended up picking out another empanada - not because we were still hungry but because they were really good and flavourful. I would actually describe them as what you would get if you took the best elements of a pie, quiche and empanada and then came up with different flavour combinations. I don't remember if we got dessert or not but definitely had coffee and the owner/waiter even offered us a little digestif to go with it. It seems to be run by youngish owners and the service was great. Prices are those of a big city but reasonable enough.

We wouldn't have found it otherwise, it's located in a narrow alley, a bit out of the main road, although just a few minutes walk from the museum. It was tiny and crowded and we got a small table in a corner seated on barstools, but pleased to even get a table. It was a small place, but with a lovely atmosphere, clean and beautifully decorated. Got the menu, and complementary olives after a minute. Everything sounded good, but we landed on trying empanadas (a tiny savoury pai) manchego cheese, and provolone (witch turned out to be melted cheese with tomatoes and onion) Had we been able to eat more, the small pizzas looked great, and so did the salads. Everything looked good, really. The food was excellent. My son greatly favoured the provolone, that was served with toasted bread sprinkled with olive oil and dried herbs. I favoured the manchego cheese also sprinkled with herbs, and accompanied by a glass of red. The pais melted in our mouths. It was delicious. The staff was attentive, and smiling although very busy with a full set of guests. We couldn't stop smiling, thoroughly enjoying every aspect of the experience.

It's cosy, homely - in fact it feels like the conversion of an intellectual family's front room - that's to say a sitting room lined with books and photos, now dotted with dining tables and chairs. The waitress speaks good English - always an unexpected bonus in Madrid - although the menu is in Spanish (which I mention for visitors, we do speak it!).  The owner appears and talks at length about his philosophy of cooking, the family and his mother, and how he latched onto 'patella' - his take on paella - and makes his recommendations. But despite promoting his raw mushroom slices in young balsamic oil and tomato slices with ham, we can't help thinking both starter dishes are bland. The main course of patella de marinera, when it comes, is proudly presented at 90 degrees to the horizontal. Sorry, but if my food is hung at that angle I expect it to slide onto the floor, not stick to the pan. And so it proves, that the house style is to cook it to burnt, removing all trace of the valencian saffron that we had proudly been shown half an hour earlier. As for the marinera, a few small pieces of squid or similar dot the otherwise overly cooked rice.  After two rounds of disappointment, the surprise was the desert, a fresh and tasty strawberry sorbet and delightful chocolate sauce. But by then it was too late. I'm not Spanish so I may have missed something, given the other positive reviews here. But I've had much better, juicier paella elsewhere and for the price, and despite a lovely atmosphere, I won't be going back.",2013-09-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991647-Reviews-or230-Casa_Benigna-Madrid.html,UID_19214,0.057,0.83,0.112,0.964,0.1152553175990675,0.4530831148018647,0.6103666666666666,1710,136,0.07953216374269,1,52,False,38,0.1285714285714285,0.1428571428571428,0.2142857142857142,0.1,0.1142857142857142,0.0142857142857142,0.0428571428571428,0.0428571428571428,0.1285714285714285,0.0714285714285714,306,211,4.584967320261438,0,0,casa benigna hidden away unprepossess back street near parqu berlin even glimps front door unsur await insid cosi home fact feel like convers intellectu famili front room say sit room line book photo dot dine tabl chair waitress speak good english alway unexpect bonu madrid although menu spanish mention visitor speak owner appear talk length philosophi cook famili mother latch onto patella take paella make recommend despit promot raw mushroom slice young balsam oil tomato slice ham help think starter dish bland main cours patella de marinera come proudli present degre horizont sorri food hung angl expect slide onto floor stick pan prove hous style cook burnt remov trace valencian saffron proudli shown half hour earlier marinera small piec squid similar dot otherwis overli cook rice two round disappoint surpris desert fresh tasti strawberri sorbet delight chocol sauc late spanish may miss someth given posit review much better juicier paella elsewher price despit love atmospher go back,bad review,2

We started with a yummy sangria then shared a nice Albariño. We shared the house-made smoked salmon starter- excellent. We tried 2 of the paella dishes- the seafood and the chicken and veggies. Both were top notch. The paella was thin in the pan but had the crispy rice in the bottom of the pan. So good! Great olive oil for the bread. The strawberry sorbet was a perfect finish to the meal.

He has devised his own pan, made out of copper and covered in nickel (so is safe to cook on). Because of the very specific way paella is done in Spain, and he uses a different technique, he calls his patella. Norberto and his mother run the place, which has a lovely atmosphere. I went with colleagues on a Saturday for lunch. We were 10, we sat in the “library” which is a separate room for big groups like ours. W ordered 2 assorted entrees (salmon, tomatoes, veggies) and 2 patellas. One seafood, the other one chicken and veggies. Rice was cooked perfectly, and crunchy on the side, which I absolutely loved it!! He explained that in order to cook evenly the rice, one should not use big pieces of meats or veggies, and that in the end; the star of the plate (for him) is the rice. For dessert we order 2 of each they have available so we could all try everything. The one I liked the most was the strawberry sorbet served with balsamic vinegar!! AMAIZING. Wine selection was nice. After all this, they as compliment on the house they served us tejas (very thing cookies with almonds) and chocolate ganache, and the pousse-café they offered 3 different liquors from Galicia. I had the green apple, and it was delicious. They smoke their rice, they do their own olive oil and balsamic vinegar. And all is sold in the restaurant.

While it's obviously known for its amazing steak, the whole menu is great, from the vegetables to the truffle fries. The wine selection is also fantastic.  What makes it stand out is the ambience and the design; the owners have painstakingly designed the interior to resemble an Argentinean/Uruguayan ranch house, and you notice from the second you walk in and smell the wood burning. The jazz and laidback music paired with the amazing lighting (candles and otherwise) create a wonderful ambience that can be enjoyed either as a date or as a long night with a big group.

If you want vegan pizza you won't be disappointed. They have cracked a good pizza base, but pizza with vegan cheese is pizza with vegan cheese. There will always be issues of taste and texture. I am fine with both and the three stars are bases on that. Had my vegetarian daughter believed the revelations mentioned in some reviews she would have been sorely disappointed. This is okay pizza with vegan cheese. My daughter's mushroom risotto was not a sublime creamy blend of mixed mushrooms and truffle, it was very ordinary. Vegan risotto can be done much better than this. I got the impression of ingredients being assembled but not being combined with any finesse. The deserts were, quite frankly, an abomination. The lemon pie looked like lemon meringue pie, but it lacked all the taste and texture of a non-vegan version; the Ferreo Rocher cake was dry and further spoilt by a thick, strong and overly-sweet topping.

We didn't try any of the hot ""classic Japanese"" selections but these also looked good from what we saw at neighboring tables. This restaurant is definitely deserving of their Michelin star. Prices are high for Madrid but lower than what would be payed in NYC or LA for a similar meal. Overall would definitely recommend for any sushi lover. We reserved a table around a week in advance. We went here on a Wednesday night around 9:30p, was initially very empty but by 10:30p the place was full (we are still not quite on the Spanish meal schedule I guess). Started with a salmon and tuna sashimi and sushi platter (8 nigiri and toro roll) which were both very good. Then proceeded on to 5 orders (2 pieces each) of the ""Kabuki"" nigiri including quail egg with pate, beef tar-tar with jalepeno, toro with caramelized sugar, white fish with pine nuts; all were very good with interesting, unique flavors. They also had a good sake and wine selection. Finally, my wife has celiac disease and they were able to accommodate with a large amount of the menu being gluten free (as most sushi is), including many of the ""Kabuki"" nigiri.",2019-05-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717249-Reviews-Kabuki-Madrid.html,UID_8956,0.028,0.762,0.21,0.9955,0.4187941628264208,0.5279646697388634,0.4939399999999999,1403,112,0.0798289379900213,0,46,False,49,0.1267605633802817,0.1408450704225352,0.2957746478873239,0.1126760563380281,0.1408450704225352,0.028169014084507,0.0140845070422535,0.0422535211267605,0.056338028169014,0.0422535211267605,249,167,4.63855421686747,0,0,eaten best sushi restaur nyc la think par best great mix excel classic nigiri sashimi also good kabuki nigiri interest spanish european japanes fusion remind ya nyc tri hot classic japanes select also look good saw neighbor tabl restaur definit deserv michelin star price high madrid lower would pay nyc la similar meal overal would definit recommend sushi lover reserv tabl around week advanc went wednesday night around p initi empti p place full still quit spanish meal schedul guess start salmon tuna sashimi sushi platter nigiri toro roll good proceed order piec kabuki nigiri includ quail egg pate beef tar tar jalepeno toro caramel sugar white fish pine nut good interest uniqu flavor also good sake wine select final wife celiac diseas abl accommod larg amount menu gluten free sushi includ mani kabuki nigiri,very good review,5

When I arrived, the restaurant was empty. Only one of the waiting staff spoke English, so I was passed around a bit before being walked to some tables. I was alone and asked if I could sit in the window, they told me know as they were reserved, so I sat in the middle and ordered my food. They serve in weight and so 200g of prawns was the recommendation. As it wasn't on the menu, I wasn't aware of the price. It came out very quickly and they gave me a piece of bread, as requested. It was delicious. Exactly what I was after. I finished it and drank my water and asked for the bill. At 40 Euros for 12 prawns and a litre of water, I felt this was expensive. BUT it was what I was looking for, so it was ok. My biggest issue was that out of the 8 tables in the window that were empty when I arrived, only one was occupied when I left.

It's a restaurant of two halves, one with larger tables, one with many more tables for two, so ideal for visitors. It's always difficult to find a restaurant in Spain open on Nochebuena, which traditionally is a time for to be with the family, so we were pleased to be able to make a reservation, even if we did have to pay a small deposit in advance. We arrived at 21:00 and left just before midnight, having been made very welcome and feeling we were among friends. Because of the day it was a set eleven course meal, but excellent value for money. The food was of a high quality and the drinks wholly acceptable. The owner, Esteban was very much in evidence, helping to serve and clear, so really hands on. We will be eating there again.

Tables are quite far from each other and you can talk without your neightbore listen what you say , seat are confortable , the place is clean , no kitchen smell. The personel is very attentive and professional and service is fast if considering that all is done expressely. What is however surprising is the quality of the material used and the perfect cooking of sead food they are serving. Shell , prawn even the rare Perceves are always available at the best of their performance. We were 6 and we have tasted more than 10 different plates , all perfect , one after the other in timely continuity , all warm and juicy. My guests were so happy and frankly very seldom you can dine at this global level having variety of sea food and fish. we had 4 bottle of champagne and with a big fish as main course plus dessert the bill was Euro 750. If instead of french vine we had some good spanish the bill would have been sustantially lower.

Food is outstanding, great quality and wonderfully prepared. Meat is outstanding, side dishes and desserts delicious. However we went for lunch and it was obvious that on that day they were understaffed. Also in order to be able to go on a summer day they need to put blinds on their windows and dramatically improve their air conditioning. One of us was sitting next to a west facing window and it got unbearable hot. For the rest of us it was just veeery hot. Specially for a restaurant that has an open kitchen with a big grill place they have to definitely do something about cooling it.

The menus is a bit unusual from the standard sushi restaurant in Madrid or elsewhere in Span but this is not a negative comment. Listen carefully about the specials of the day, as they are likely to be exceptional. On the day of our visit the specials included razor clams and cockles. They were both done to perfection! We also allowed the chef to choose our nigiris and we were not disappointed! There were all excellent, even the ‘standard’ salmon and tuna; the exceptional one was the mackerel. I am not usually a fan of mackerel but this was done wonderfully. There are also some unusual items on the menu, worth exploring; we tried the bone marrow which was served with Japanese seaweed bread. Not a usual item but wonderful nevertheless.  The restaurant is stylish and the service exceptional. The wine list is excellent and if you want to finish with something sweet they have desert wine choices which are not on the list. We finished with the chocolate selection, which was not very Japanese but the perfect end to our meal.  The restaurant is not cheap, but the prices are appropriate for what it offers.

I even tried to eat here that night (with my bachelorette party), but they were closed on a day stated open. Then they emailed me about the wrong date reservation. I told them I didn't want it. It was within the free cancellation date (I have this confirmed with their stated policy for a weekday and the email time stamps). They charged my credit card a 75 EU cancellation fee, even though it was prior to the deadline. I tried fighting it with my friend, who speaks Spanish translating, but they will not comply. They last said they are ""looking into it"", but haven't replied in over a month. TERRIBLE SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE.

But if I could, I would give Nina Pasta bar all the stars! The restaurant is on a nice small street, so while wandering the area we just happened to stumble upon it on our first day in Madrid. When I saw that it was authentic pasta, I figured it would be great to give it a try, and I'm so glad that we did. We went on a Sunday, the same day as El Rastro, huge weekly flea market in the La Latina neighborhood. The streets were packed and so was Nina. However, we snagged a large community table in the back. One important tip about going on Sunday- they have a limited menu due to the amount of people coming because of El Rastro. The menu offers 2-3 tapas, and only 2 lunch options. But don't worry because both options are AMAZING. Their carbonara and Gnocci are to die for! We also had tinto de Verano to drink (sangria) that was also really yummy.  We loved this place so much that on our last full day we had to return for one more meal! We went on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch, perfect time because it wasn't crowded and they also had their full menu available. We were happy to be greeted by the same lovely servers who remembered us from Sunday. My fiancé went with the carbonara again and I tried one of their daily specials, and OMG I am so glad so did. They offered a pappardelle black truffle and parmesan pasta and it was life changing to say the least. I spent time thinking about how I can bring some back to the US. I also tried to savor each bite by eating very slowly lol. During that meal we also had the gnocchi bravas, their take on the classic patatas bravas. That also was amazing, and a nice change since we'd been eating the traditional bravos all week. Please, please, please if you're in Madrid stop by Ninas Pasta Bar for lunch. You will not regret it and you probably will think about the pasta for the rest of your trip, like I did!!",2019-10-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d15124828-Reviews-Nina_Pastabar-Madrid.html,UID_20043,0.023,0.769,0.208,0.9982,0.2907525510204081,0.5249149659863946,0.4180304347826087,1943,190,0.0977869274318064,5,50,False,81,0.1884057971014492,0.1159420289855072,0.217391304347826,0.0434782608695652,0.1014492753623188,0.0144927536231884,0.0289855072463768,0.0434782608695652,0.144927536231884,0.1014492753623188,375,227,4.181333333333333,0,0,think ever excit write review restaur could would give nina pasta bar star restaur nice small street wander area happen stumbl upon first day madrid saw authent pasta figur would great give tri glad went sunday day el rastro huge weekli flea market la latina neighborhood street pack nina howev snag larg commun tabl back one import tip go sunday limit menu due amount peopl come el rastro menu offer tapa lunch option worri option amaz carbonara gnocci die also tinto de verano drink sangria also realli yummi love place much last full day return one meal went tuesday afternoon lunch perfect time crowd also full menu avail happi greet love server rememb us sunday fianc went carbonara tri one daili special omg glad offer pappardel black truffl parmesan pasta life chang say least spent time think bring back us also tri savor bite eat slowli lol meal also gnocchi brava take classic patata brava also amaz nice chang sinc eat tradit bravo week pleas pleas pleas madrid stop nina pasta bar lunch regret probabl think pasta rest trip like,good review,4

We were too late to book for Saturday night, so went for Sunday lunchtime (from 13h00) instead. First thing to say is that Abaceria Tapas Lambuzo looks like nothing at all from the outside (nondescript street, small doorway, no tables outside). You would walk past it without a second glance, but trust me, it's great. The place is small, and to be honest, not the most comfortable restaurant in the world, but with a great atmosphere, delightful staff and really good food from Cadiz in southern Spain. The front of the restaurant is basically for 'bar tapas' and the crowd spills out onto the street; the restaurant is to the rear. Unlike many comparable places, the menu (English translation available) is fairly short, but everything we had (potato salad with tuna, anchovies, pork cheeks, clams in sherry, almond cake, cheese with honey) was delicious, well-presented and good value for money. Most dishes come as either a full or a half raciones (or tapa size if you are at the bar) so you can sample several things without over-facing your stomach or your wallet. Wine list is straightforward and accessible. Service is friendly and efficient (it has to be, the place is rammed!)

As you may have guessed from the name, they serve crepes. There are savoury crêpes and sweet ones. This place, like just about everywhere I have passed today, is packed. I managed to get the last table (I saw people being turned away as I was seated). As I have said, this place isn't big but it is busy. Despite the number of clients in the place, the staff seemed to make time to 'play' with a table of French seniors, laughing and joking with them in French. I ordered a Crêpe with cheese, tuna and vegetables. When it arrived, my first thought was ""meh"" as it didn't look all that inviting. Nor did there seem to be too much of it. I was wrong on both counts. Whilst it wasn't particularly thick, there was a layer of melted Emmental cheese running through it which made it quite filling. The vegetables were served on top and added a sweetness to the flavour. Sadly I was unable to identify any tuna at all. The dish itself was very filling and I was unable to eat all of it, although, if there had been something to offer a break in a textured I may have been able to. This singularity of texture in a meal seems to be a bit of a running theme in this bit of the world. I saw sweet crepes being served to the table of French oldies. It was done with great flair, especially those that were served flambé.  I was much too full to partake. My meal, with a couple of beers, came to 16€. This was a bit of an experience. I'm not too sure I'd do it again although it may be nice to try a sweet Crêpe.",2016-06-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6701232-Reviews-or40-Le_Comptoir_de_la_Crepe-Madrid.html,UID_30924,0.037,0.841,0.122,0.9869,0.1111607142857142,0.4888888888888889,0.3528318181818182,1627,172,0.1057160417947142,0,51,False,55,0.1489361702127659,0.1276595744680851,0.3191489361702128,0.1063829787234042,0.1702127659574468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851063829787234,0.0425531914893617,318,189,4.116352201257862,0,0,plan eat la plater place full littl road found hole wall place may guess name serv crepe savouri cr pe sweet one place like everywher pass today pack manag get last tabl saw peopl turn away seat said place big busi despit number client place staff seem make time play tabl french senior laugh joke french order cr pe chees tuna veget arriv first thought meh look invit seem much wrong count whilst particularli thick layer melt emment chees run made quit fill veget serv top ad sweet flavour sadli unabl identifi tuna dish fill unabl eat although someth offer break textur may abl singular textur meal seem bit run theme bit world saw sweet crepe serv tabl french oldi done great flair especi serv flamb much full partak meal coupl beer came bit experi sure although may nice tri sweet cr pe,average review,3

The service was excellent and the staff both friendly and helpful,2016-05-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6701232-Reviews-or40-Le_Comptoir_de_la_Crepe-Madrid.html,UID_30925,0.0,0.717,0.283,0.9842,0.2061111111111111,0.5644444444444444,0.3301166666666666,509,46,0.0903732809430255,0,6,False,23,0.1282051282051282,0.2051282051282051,0.2564102564102564,0.1025641025641025,0.1794871794871795,0.0,0.0,0.0256410256410256,0.0512820512820512,0.0512820512820512,90,64,4.666666666666667,0,0,love small restaur offer crepe rang extens includ savouri sweet crepe like crepe look someth differ definit place madrid particularli like sweet crepe especi dulc de lech drink offer french cider serv tea cup love chang drink beer wine meal servic excel staff friendli help,good review,4

The fours of use each ordered a different desert crepe (for dinner). They were all delicious and satisfying and as good as the crepes we had in Paris.

I went back to the restaurant and the waitress called the owner who came in in10 minutes and spoke excellent English, explained that there was no charge and that sometimes the credit card company does this, and to call him the next day if there was an issue.

The general level in this city is not excellent (compared to London) but the genuine passion of these guys should be rewarded. I went there for an early quick dinner at 20.30 (in Madrid, customers would flock around 9pm), no booking.. Waitress turned out to be from Sardinia (where I was born) so it was a pleasant surprise. The impression is that they expect a relaxed meal with many courses taking advantage of the daily advice from the waitress (very fluent in Spanish and clearly quite experienced dealing with customers).  Since my case was slightly different, I asked whether they would provide half portions (to try two different mains) and she said that would depend on the main. Eventually I was happy to order only homemade tagliatelle with mushrooms because I love homemade pasta. They were quite tasty, a little too greasy but it seems a common issue for this type of sauce. I opted for a pastiera as a dessert; it is quite hard to find it as it's less renowned than other desserts and this praises the boldness and the skills of the chef.

So it was with great relief we found Ouh, Babbo!, an Italian restaurant tucked away near the Puerta del Sol. At first we weren't sure if we should try it, as the inside decor of red, white, and black was a bit off-putting and had more of an '80s lounge vibe to it. But the food, ooohhh the food, MORE than made up for any lack of design taste.  We were there for one reason: pizza. But quite frankly, we weren't expecting much. After all, this is Spain and if we wanted great pizza then we were on the wrong side of the Mediterranean. Wrong! The pizza was absolutely delicious, from the crust to the sauce to the cheese and ingredients - it was crazy good. As good as any pizza we've eaten in Italy, and that says a lot because we've eaten a silly amount of pizza in Italy. Backing up just a moment (I was so excited to get to the pizza part), we were also presented with a little Italian tapas before our pizza, which was arugula wrapped in a slice of mortadella and drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. Heaven. And, although we didn't have any pasta dishes, we eyeballed just about everything coming out of the kitchen and the other diners seemed extremely pleased with their pasta selections. Without question, we would heartily recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delectable, quality Italian meal in Spain. Because man cannot live by tapas alone...",2009-04-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1023949-Reviews-or80-Ouh_Babbo-Madrid.html,UID_30984,0.059,0.782,0.159,0.986,0.1489177489177489,0.5091269841269842,0.4350928571428571,1443,129,0.0893970893970894,2,49,False,48,0.1132075471698113,0.2075471698113207,0.2830188679245283,0.0566037735849056,0.1509433962264151,0.0188679245283018,0.0,0.0188679245283018,0.1132075471698113,0.0377358490566037,263,173,4.486692015209125,0,0,spain week admit littl ham great relief found ouh babbo italian restaur tuck away near puerta del sol first sure tri insid decor red white black bit put loung vibe food ooohhh food made lack design tast one reason pizza quit frankli expect much spain want great pizza wrong side mediterranean wrong pizza absolut delici crust sauc chees ingredi crazi good good pizza eaten itali say lot eaten silli amount pizza itali back moment excit get pizza part also present littl italian tapa pizza arugula wrap slice mortadella drizzl balsam vinaigrett heaven although pasta dish eyebal everyth come kitchen diner seem extrem pleas pasta select without question would heartili recommend restaur anyon look delect qualiti italian meal spain man cannot live tapa alon,very good review,5

It is close to Opera Metro station, in the very heart of Madrid and has become one of the best italian eateries in Madrid. It offers delicious fresh italian delicacies in a relaxed atmosphere. We shared antipasti: a fresh burrata, and a fine pizza marinara, which was perfect, thin and tasty, then we had a pasta or a risotto each. Which was more than enough. Perfect Pappardelle alle 4 funghi, nice risotto...and I had and scrumptious spaghetti dish seasoned at your table with a raw egg, freshly grated truffle chips and fine Parmesan cheese. Desserts are also good, with wonderful -perhaps too sweet- canoli and the 'pie of the day', this time an apple pie with a cinnamon 'crocanti' topping.Including service, coffes and drinks, we paid 30 euros per person. The owner and a couple of musicians sing 'serenatas' every Thursday night, so if you want to go for a late dinner, book well in advance. Ask for a table in the main dining room. It's small, but it's there where the action is.",2011-12-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1023949-Reviews-or70-Ouh_Babbo-Madrid.html,UID_19350,0.0,0.816,0.184,0.9789,0.3444159544159543,0.5312915479582146,0.3364,1071,79,0.0737628384687208,0,42,False,42,0.1428571428571428,0.1666666666666666,0.3095238095238095,0.0952380952380952,0.119047619047619,0.0238095238095238,0.0,0.0238095238095238,0.0714285714285714,0.0476190476190476,186,141,4.763440860215054,0,0,run well known spanish italian actor restaur becom popular close opera metro station heart madrid becom one best italian eateri madrid offer delici fresh italian delicaci relax atmospher share antipasti fresh burrata fine pizza marinara perfect thin tasti pasta risotto enough perfect pappardel all funghi nice risotto scrumptiou spaghetti dish season tabl raw egg freshli grate truffl chip fine parmesan chees dessert also good wonder perhap sweet canoli pie day time appl pie cinnamon crocanti top includ servic coff drink paid euro per person owner coupl musician sing serenata everi thursday night want go late dinner book well advanc ask tabl main dine room small action,very good review,5

I eat there only once as I wanted to try as many restaurants as possible on my trip. They only serve Crepes but there are many savoury crepe delights and also some lovely sweet crepes for desert. My wife and I had two savoury crepes each and shared one sweet crepe. These were lovely to eat and while I think one savoury crepe would be enough for lunch maybe with a sweet crepe, for dinner you would probably need two savoury crepes to fill you up.

I think I was just hitting the touristy, lazy tapas places, and not the great ones. But after several terrible meals, I was thrilled to discover Le Comptoir! It's run by a great looking, really charming frenchman and his equally charming wife/girlfriend in a quaint little hole in the wall. This guy did everything himself in a little tiny kitchen but he worked magic. And just so you don't get the wrong idea, these are not little fussy crepes. These are big macho manly crepes with a little substance to them. They are satisfying. Don't let this guy talk to your wife cause she'll fall in love with him. But do take his word on what his best dessert crepe is. I forgot it's name but we had two of them in a row. Two in a row!!! If you knew my wife, you'd know what kind of miracle that crepe has to be to let me have two of them! Oh and this is the first place I experienced Mahou beer on draft. It is heavenly!

We searched creperies and this one popped up with great reviews so we figured we would check it out. Le Comptoir was an adorable hole-in-the-wall place that makes you feel like you're sitting in a friend's old-fashion home with a comfortable feel. There was only one guy working who understand English pretty well. With only about 25 minutes to sit, order, eat, pay, and be our own way he insured us that we had plenty of time. Sure enough, our food was out within 5 minutes of ordering. Granted it was decently empty, but he was the only one working, cooking, etc. The crepes tasted so good that we had to come back the next day. This time it was a little later in the evening and every table was full. Yet again, quick service. There were two servers working, and the same guy cooking in the little closet of a kitchen. The food was brought to us within maybe 10 minutes tops of ordering. These may be the best crepes I've had so far and makes me not want to go anywhere else.

I am a flight attendant and 5 of us went early (8:45pm) without a reservation on a Friday night. Every table was reserved (they are booked full almost every night so make a reservation), but they graciously seated us with the promise that we would be finished by 10:15 (when the next guests had the table). We got the recommendation from a pax on our flight who is friends with the staff. We truly were treated like Royalty! Abel our waiter is the best! Amazing food at very reasonable prices. I had the Tuna (light dish and perfectly seared with an amazing sauce), the Baccalao was cooked perfectly, and the pork dish was succulent. We also ordered the Beef noodle dish which was very rich and delicious (but might need a bit more beef according to my friend). All in all, I strongly recommend this restaurant. Only downside, they do not have English menus which wasn't a problem for our group as I speak the language and Abel also speaks English. Enjoy!

Getting tired of Spanish fare, we were longing for anything besides tapas with fries. We found Ouh Babbo, a small Italian Bistro, just up the hill from the Opera. Ate dinner there twice, fettuccine with mushrooms knocked our socks off along with a beet salad to share. It was a Thurs night when locals joined the Italian owners and his band for an hour of terrific music. Bruno later told us he played a lead in Momma Mia. It showed, the boy could sing! We made a point to have our last meal of the trip back there. This time we ordered Bruno's special pasta. A spaghetti type noodle done in butter, topped with poached egg.

All genuine Italian with bags of flavour. But the highlight was the entertainment. Our waiter bore a striking resemblance to Ryan Stiles and had many of his mannerisms. He said that Thursdays were special as the band played. At about 11 he donned a cap and joined one of the waitresses and 2 other musicians in one corner and sang Italian songs still wearing his apron. There were long stories (which I didn't understand) and vast overacting somewhat reminiscent of a bugs bunny cartoon but the music was great. The waitress who normally played drums even got up during one song and did an impressive flamenco dance.,2014-09-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1023949-Reviews-or60-Ouh_Babbo-Madrid.html,UID_31057,0.018,0.768,0.214,0.9812,0.3054761904761905,0.5553174603174603,0.6824714285714286,654,51,0.0779816513761468,0,11,False,17,0.125,0.2083333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.2083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,114,90,4.745614035087719,0,0,firstli food wine great genuin italian bag flavour highlight entertain waiter bore strike resembl ryan stile mani manner said thursday special band play don cap join one waitress musician one corner sang italian song still wear apron long stori understand vast overact somewhat reminisc bug bunni cartoon music great waitress normal play drum even got one song impress flamenco danc,good review,4

Recommended by the excellent hotel (Preciados), so we ventured in. Very close by but with no outdoor seating on a lovely evening following the coronation of Felipe. Bread and an excellent artichoke appetizer was served. Ordered the Mozarella e Pomodoro to split as a salad followed by the cappelli di zucca and girelle. Both entrees were excellent; mozarella would have been better with basil instead of arugula. House wine was fine. Surprised by the 'gratis' lemoncello at the end. And a tiny bit surprised by the small charge for the bread....didn't order it but did eat some (half) with the olive oil that we asked for...so we got a free artichoke appetizer and some lemoncello but paid for the bread....fair enough. Tax not included. Fair deal; fun evening due to the helpful owner/proprietor. Would definitely go back.

(Just allow enough time to be able to indulge yourself fully - you'll want to.) The decor is elegant - not flashy - and the restaurant feels very comfortable, both indoors and, in the summer, on the large, covered and air conditioned terrace (That sounds paradoxical... but it's true. And it works beautifully.)  The food is top drawer, simple, fairly traditional Spanish although there are some wonderful and surprising specialities to try such as the tortilla with clams. Wine and copas (especially G&T) are all good - properly prepared and served.  I've eaten here on various occasions and never been disappointed by the food, service or atmosphere.

The appetizer is really good and it matches with the pasta and my drink. By far, one of the best appetizer recommendation! If you come by, make sure you order capote ragout as not only it is super delicious but also you can tell all the preparation goes behind making this pasta. It’s one of a kind taste and only here!

The service was a little surly (but we were a large international group of very thirsty and probably slightly picky diners). The cuisine is first class; imaginative and even a little off-the-wall and is prepared with great attention to detail. However, since its focus is most definitely on Japanese cuisine and predominantly fish, it was difficult for those amongst us who were not fans of small slices of raw fish to find anything to appeal. Don't ask for bread to help fill the gap - they claimed not to have any! Also, the service was pretty slow and the amount of food minimal, so don't go there hungry!

Just up the road from Atocha, on Calle Heurtes is Le Comptoir de la Crepe. A charming restaurant owned by a man from Toulouse France who has lived a parallel life to mine leaving his homeland to work and live in London, Dublin, San Diego, somewhere in souther Spain I didn’t catch and currently in Madrid. Because my work takes me all over the world I have eaten in all types of restaurants. When I am not with a client I am always in search of the not the best, but the most delectable and salivating foods from local restaurants. Why? Because these are the most interesting and vitally important to a local community.  Reading previous reviews this little place astonished diners from almost the very first crepe. Le Comptoir de la Crepe in its early days could be a marvel of palate defining savory or sweet crepes, flambés and gametes couple with some great French cider. I had dinner there the first night I was in Madrid that appeared to take me back to a French coastal town restaurant I visited many years ago. There are no appetizers. There are small meals of savory crepes to start with that are poetry about light eating and an introduction to the restaurant and its pleasures. Le Comptoir is a wonderful place to eat by yourself but is so much more fun to eat at with someone you love or friends as you can share in the delights of what plate has come to your table - unexpected deliciousness! Dessert crepes and flambés are even better. such excitement breeds real emotion with your fellow diners and have an effect on you for life as memories are made. This little restaurant rewards companionship and the senses without overindulgence allowing you to drink a flavorful Vino Tientto as you wander up the street after dinner. Le Comptoir is by all accounts a very personal restaurant.  The owner is the chef and wanders around tables making sure you are enjoying the food and atmosphere. In fact you could probably say that he is part of the atmosphere. Laughter rings out often from the front door right through the restaurant and it is pleasant and non-disturbing.I would recommend the duck crepes with cider to drink and a flambé for dessert. Take your time here and enjoy what it is offering. This place is special and will hold many memories for you until you return. I'd like you to have great memories of Madrid too, so please even visit this place for dessert before you leave.",2015-05-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6701232-Reviews-or80-Le_Comptoir_de_la_Crepe-Madrid.html,UID_31122,0.012,0.755,0.233,0.9991,0.3039866836062488,0.4616528640441684,0.5308454545454545,2466,221,0.0896188158961881,1,34,False,79,0.1325301204819277,0.1566265060240964,0.3734939759036144,0.0963855421686747,0.180722891566265,0.0,0.0,0.0120481927710843,0.036144578313253,0.0120481927710843,441,254,4.5895691609977325,0,0,best littl fun restaur madrid french crepe road atocha call heurt le comptoir de la crepe charm restaur own man toulous franc live parallel life mine leav homeland work live london dublin san diego somewher souther spain catch current madrid work take world eaten type restaur client alway search best delect saliv food local restaur interest vital import local commun read previou review littl place astonish diner almost first crepe le comptoir de la crepe earli day could marvel palat defin savori sweet crepe flamb gamet coupl great french cider dinner first night madrid appear take back french coastal town restaur visit mani year ago appet small meal savori crepe start poetri light eat introduct restaur pleasur le comptoir wonder place eat much fun eat someon love friend share delight plate come tabl unexpect delici dessert crepe flamb even better excit breed real emot fellow diner effect life memori made littl restaur reward companionship sens without overindulg allow drink flavor vino tientto wander street dinner le comptoir account person restaur owner chef wander around tabl make sure enjoy food atmospher fact could probabl say part atmospher laughter ring often front door right restaur pleasant non disturb would recommend duck crepe cider drink flamb dessert take time enjoy offer place special hold mani memori return like great memori madrid pleas even visit place dessert leav,very good review,5

We love to travel and eating the local cusine is an important part of our vacation  El Rincon de Esteban is a wonderful restaurant. The food, the service and the atmosphere all come together and provide a very pleasant dining experience. Everything we tired was excellent , fresh and top quality. I observed the wait staff being very plesant to some patrons that quite frankly did not deserve to be treated so graciously. Now that's a class act in of its self! The owner, Esteban, was on the floor and going from table to table to see how everyone was doing. We asked him his opinion on several dishes and to pick the Rose wine he felt would be best - he did not let us down. The food is traditional cusine of the region.

I came here mainly because it open at 7pm instead of 8/9 pm as most of the restaurants in Madrid. I was surprise to see so many famous people photos inside the restaurant. This restaurant has history and glory time in the past for sure. The boss is cheerful old man and he is very energetic and lovely.  I even saw a photo of Spanish King and queen and hand writing too. Tom Cruise and many famous football players were there too.  Eating here means you are eating a similar meal as a current Spanish king did.  I like the lamb shoulder here. It's very simple and very traditional. But it tasted very good. I had a spainish mix seafood rice ( paella). Which is good for share. We also ordered bone steak but I don't like it because it's age beef( boss did not notice me) . I know many people like age beef but not me. It's looked very good. Dessert is a must skip! I tried two but it's both were soso.  Overall, I am very happy to have a royal dinner at a very moderate price. I highly recommend you to order lamb shoulder and paella.

Being solo I didn’t not think I was able to benefit from the many food possibilities however I was impressed  I was given bread and olives to start  Followed by a wonderful artichoke dish .. there was mention of foie gras but I could not taste it. Needless to say it was delicious if somewhat expensive as a starter. My main was a beautifully simply cooked whole sole. Fresh . Delicious. The interiors were romantic ( candles) and cosy and the service was impeccable . It has obviously been around for a long time so there is many photos on the walls . Just lovely .The lovely Thomas looked after me so well and assisted in my choices. It seemed that most diners were local so of you are looking for an authentic meal that is quite different to the many tapas bars then I suggest you try it. The price point is a little higher but it is well worth the experience.  It is quite central so can easily be walked to from the centre of Madrid ,2019-08-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1496002-Reviews-or30-El_Rincon_de_Esteban-Madrid.html,UID_31135,0.0,0.758,0.242,0.9952,0.3337121212121212,0.6090548340548341,0.3569181818181818,1015,92,0.0906403940886699,0,16,False,44,0.1333333333333333,0.2,0.3333333333333333,0.0888888888888888,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0444444444444444,189,130,4.349206349206349,0,0,beauti tradit restaur wonder option menu solo think abl benefit mani food possibl howev impress given bread oliv start follow wonder artichok dish mention foie gra could tast needless say delici somewhat expens starter main beauti simpli cook whole sole fresh delici interior romant candl cosi servic impecc obvious around long time mani photo wall love love thoma look well assist choic seem diner local look authent meal quit differ mani tapa bar suggest tri price point littl higher well worth experi quit central easili walk centr madrid,good review,4

Again a mixed salad and the same white wine. The tray of olives and bread arrived first, soon followed by an amuse bouche. Then a small lemon sorbet, to cleanse the palate. Then the platter of a whole Monkfish was presented at the table and then served to us. Time passes as we enjoy our food. Then we finish and a dessert menu is five to us.

The atmosphere was very pleasing, giving us high hopes for a wonderful dinner.  The house offers up olives, a dinner role and pate. Not exciting, but something to nibble on with drinks. The wines are on the pricier side. We had been spoiled after several days in Salamanca; wines were excellent and very reasonable.  We started with a mixed house salad. That consisted of unappetizing lettuce and tuna, tasteless tomatoes, a few onions and marinated red pepper. After traveling a few weeks through  Greece, Portugal and Spain and having the freshest and tastiest salads daily, this was a disaster. And as much as we knew that paella is best served up in Valencia, we had a craving that wouldn’t be sidetracked. We chose their deluxe paella with lobster, shrimp, mussels and monkfish. The overly soupy rice with tidbits of fish was certainly not deserving of a €48 price tag. After dozens of restaurant meals on this trip, this dinner was by far our most expensive and the only one that disappointed.  To make the best of a situation; we opted to order dessert. We tried their creme brûlée. I think they call it Catalan creme.

The restaurant's interior is really nice and the atmosphere was laid back and yet refined. I'm a huge fan of pancakes, but the crepes on offer here are on an entirely different level: light, delicious, and there are so many different dishes to choose from (both savory and sweet). Each crepe arrived very quickly, and I found that two made for a perfect dinner without feeling stuffed afterwards.

Lovely place very friendly staff. We chose one steak and 3 paella. The wine we chose was not available so we were offered an alternative which was fine. A free taster and olives and bread was put on the table. 4 slices of fairly ordinary bread. The steak came and was almost blue (medium ordered). It was happily replaced but this was little different but we accepted it. The paella was ok not great. The big shock was the bill. 4 slices of bread charged at €3 per slice ! Our alternative wine was €4 more than our choice. And the bottle of water we ordered which the waiter poured into 4 glasses without asking turned out to have been two bottles at €6 a time. So all in all we felt a bit like tourists ripped off for a decidedly average meal.

The place is small and a bit noisy, with a modern and friendly atmosphere. The service is impeccable and the mastery of Mario Payán, the sushiman, really impressed me. The food is spectacular (instead of ordering, I always ask Mario to serve me what he wants; the experience is always amazing, and I recommend you to do the same). I also appreciate the atmosphere: young and business people enjoying the experience in a casual environment. The area outside (terrace) is great in the summer. The only problem is that if you try once, you will become addicted to it and now I go at least once a month. Regarding the price, it is not cheap, it is truth, but I´m feed up of paying a lot for bad food in bad restaurants, especially Japanese. Here, in my opinion, the food really deserves the price you pay for it because they give you simply the best. So, don´t hesitate to go and try the experience.

The night was marred by an unhelpfull maitre who was not willing to compromise on anything culinery. Whilst i appreciate that the restaurant is japanese in essence,i cannot condone the maitre unwillingness to grill some of their tasty morsels for the benefit of those who do not like raw fish.  To add insult to injury the meal was further compounded by his unwillingless to separate the noodles from the soup. Had i been paying peanuts i would have expected monkeys but the meal was a wapping 480 euros and at 120 euros pp my disapointment is plainly palpable.

The food is a combination of Japanese with Spanish ingredients. So if you are looking for either cuisine, this could be kind of a shock (they have the usual rolls, sushi, etc but for this price I would go someplace else). However, for me, which enjoy Spanish food but am not a die-hard lover of Japanese food, really like it. Things like mozzarella tempura, Tokyo quesadilla, grilled calamari, spicy tuna, octopus rolls, BBQ beef rolls, garlic beef yaki and a sampler of different type of tuna are examples of what you can have. The big pluses that made me love this restaurant is the creative dishes (taste and combinations); the selection of sake (bigger than their wine lists) and overall service. The drawbacks is the complex menu – too many dishes and it is awfully hard to understand whether you are ordering a tiny portion or something big enough to share, need a lot of coaching from the waiter and time to read through it; and the other thing is that it is expensive. Worth it in my opinion because we were a group of 8 people that truly enjoyed it but for the price, if you don’t like it, will not only leave a sour taste in your mouth. All in all it has to be one of my favorite restaurants in Madrid. Something that could better prepare you for the experience (which I found out later) is that they have in their website their menu with lots of pictures of the dishes, take a look at it and probably will spend less time reading in the restaurant",2015-01-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717249-Reviews-or40-Kabuki-Madrid.html,UID_31177,0.029,0.814,0.157,0.9913,0.1126262626262626,0.4222222222222221,0.3731,1531,138,0.0901371652514696,0,36,False,58,0.1132075471698113,0.1886792452830188,0.2830188679245283,0.0566037735849056,0.2075471698113207,0.0188679245283018,0.0377358490566037,0.0188679245283018,0.0566037735849056,0.0188679245283018,282,175,4.432624113475177,0,0,truli enjoy restaur like everybodi food combin japanes spanish ingredi look either cuisin could kind shock usual roll sushi etc price would go someplac els howev enjoy spanish food die hard lover japanes food realli like thing like mozzarella tempura tokyo quesadilla grill calamari spici tuna octopu roll bbq beef roll garlic beef yaki sampler differ type tuna exampl big pluse made love restaur creativ dish tast combin select sake bigger wine list overal servic drawback complex menu mani dish aw hard understand whether order tini portion someth big enough share need lot coach waiter time read thing expens worth opinion group peopl truli enjoy price like leav sour tast mouth one favorit restaur madrid someth could better prepar experi found later websit menu lot pictur dish take look probabl spend less time read restaur,good review,4

Wrong, you only talk to the waiters, and the chefs do not pay any attention to you. Instead, the chefs check every girl that enters the restaurant door and comment on their outfits and bodies. Very unprofessional. My friends asked to be served whatever the chefs wanted, which in a Japanese restaurant means a lot of things out of the regular menu. Wrong again. Everything served was in the menu, which was very disappointing. The sushi is innovative and the quality is outstanding, even the chefs were smelling some of the fish before cutting it. The sashimi cuts were very well done, the combination of flavors and presentation was beautiful. Service was very good and attentive, although some times they did not know what they were serving and had to check with the chefs (remember everything was from the menu). I might come back only for the difference of the flavors, although for sure I will not sit at the bar. I would skip the miso soup, at paying 6 EUR for a very salty cup is not worthy. I would not have the tempura again as it misses seasoning and flavor both in the batter as in the prawns. The desserts did not impress me either.

Unlike its associated restaurant in Madrid, the Kabuki Wellington, the orginal Kabuki is funky, lively, informal and fun yet at the same time superbly professional in its service and presentation of each plate. The menu/carte is very extensive and to be honest I would not know where to start ordering as this is both Japanese and Spanish fusion sushi made from the finest a freshest fish, seafood, meat and vegetables that are available in Spain. So we made it easy for ourselves by taking up the recommendation of a menu, that is not listed or written anywhere, in which the chef creates a menu with a developing scale of favours from the most delicate oysters to a fully flavoured slow cooked marinated meat on the bone. Menu can be adapted according to your dietary needs or preferences and how much you would like to eat. We chose the full monty! We counted 15 courses at the end plus the welcoming amuse bouche. We chose not to have desert....there was neither space nor a desire to lose the other flavours we had been treated to over the long and exiting evening of gastronomy. Counting our drinks of beer and sake the itemised bill listing each dish and its cost was 111 euros each. Some may say this is expensive but truly this would be way more in London, New York or Tokyo. We left happy having spoken to the owner/chef (the kitchen is completely open) with a beautful printed personal copy of the menu we had eaten and a promise to ourselves to return soon. Given the number of people the chef greeted as old friends Kabuki is a place with its own returning fan club.

We walked in through the wrong there were I was greeted with a warm smile of a fatherly looking gentleman whose name I cannot recall. He did not point me to the right entrance but rather walked with me to it and inside. There I was serviced by a young man from Colombia name Johan. While speaking with Johan I learned he had worked at one of my usual spots in New Jersey named Meson Madrid. Johan is super friendly and service savvy. Well the whole staff is but something special about Johan and this great place. If you go there definitely have the Gallego Oysters which are amazingly fresh and delicious. The Ox Tale is insanely amazing actually cooked by a fellow Dominican name Manuel from Bani. I got to speak to Manuel as the gentleman who escorted me in also introduce me Tobin as I praised the Taste of the tail. And try the pudin de pan for dessert. My suggestion don’t even think about the menu just let them order for you and everything will be to your palate’s delight. Oh yeah Johan can make one heck of a Manhattan.

Food was very expensive and mediocre at best. Ordered an approximate 38 euro bottle of red spanish wine. Was told that they didn't have the wine, but had a similar bottle for the same price. Wine was served from decanter. Believing we were drinking a 38 euro bottle of wine, ordered another one. When bill came, were charged over 100 euro per bottle of wine. We objected, but all of a sudden there became an English language barrier, and management called over. Management insisted that's what we ordered. Then owner came over and asked how much tip did we want to add to the bill, that is was customary to add 10 percent. Being our first night in Spain (which the restaurant was fully aware of), and not being familiar yet with spanish tipping customs, we foolishly complied and left another 40 euro.

I usually budget between €10 and €20 for lunch but when I saw the menu I immediately knew I had made a mistake. Most of the food is probably good but the prices are so outrageous that I only had a coke (€3 for 250ml.) and a cold soup called Somen (€13).

After 10 days of traveling around Andalusia and Castilla and eating Spanish food, we were craving Japenenese food. We searched online for the one of the best Japenese restaurant and found Kabuki. We were immidiately disappointed by over salted Udon soup ... Then by the Sushis with a rice that had a mushy texture, with too much rice vinegar which overpowered the delicate taste of the fish.  Fresh quality fish has a natural fresh taste but we could not find the flavor in each fish. They also used sauces that killed the flavor instead of enhancing the flavor of the fish. For example, sweet eel sauce with octopus? All you taste is the sauce!  We also ordered Wagyu beef and it was tasty. The meat was medium rare with a nice texture and the sauces complimented the flavor of the beef.  Without the beef, I would rate this place with 2 stars. I mean, how can you fail to make good rice? All they need to do is try it before serving it.  Instead of constantly laughing and whispering, cookers at bar and waiters should look at the disappointment that was displayed on a big majority of the customer faces, and try to improve... but perhaps they don't care, and already know the kind of food they are preparing... :( PS: 3 glasses of wine + 1 soup + 6 sushis + 10 slices of Wagyu + 1 desert ... of barely standard food = 150 € at Kabuki.",2015-12-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717249-Reviews-or30-Kabuki-Madrid.html,UID_7693,0.078,0.819,0.103,0.6136,0.0738636363636363,0.5191287878787879,0.6472166666666667,1480,123,0.0831081081081081,1,50,False,49,0.0869565217391304,0.1884057971014492,0.2608695652173913,0.0289855072463768,0.1739130434782608,0.0434782608695652,0.072463768115942,0.0289855072463768,0.0579710144927536,0.0579710144927536,278,179,4.31294964028777,0,0,cannot believ place rate tripadvisor star michelin lie chef vacat day travel around andalusia castilla eat spanish food crave japenenes food search onlin one best japenes restaur found kabuki immidi disappoint salt udon soup sushi rice mushi textur much rice vinegar overpow delic tast fish fresh qualiti fish natur fresh tast could find flavor fish also use sauc kill flavor instead enhanc flavor fish exampl sweet eel sauc octopu tast sauc also order wagyu beef tasti meat medium rare nice textur sauc compliment flavor beef without beef would rate place star mean fail make good rice need tri serv instead constantli laugh whisper cooker bar waiter look disappoint display big major custom face tri improv perhap care alreadi know kind food prepar ps glass wine soup sushi slice wagyu desert bare standard food kabuki,average review,3

It was a short walk from the Westin Palace on a quiet side street.  I had Sea Bass which was good. Grilled well with basic green beans and roasted potatoes. Wife stuck with a salad. Not much too it but very good. Overall the meal was good but not overwhelming. Be aware that they load the table with Extras such as pate, breads, sardines and such. We thought they were part of the meal and munched. Bill came and it was all on there. Apparently you must tell them when you come in to remove it or you are charged. Kind of cheesy but typical of most tourist restuarants we went too. We noticed several ""regulars"" sit and ask them be removed - we should have done since we did not like most of the table snacks (sardines, olives, and strong pate). My advice is stick to paella wherever you go if you are from the states. Couple of notes: 1) Meal was pricey. With a house bottle of spanish red wine the bill ran $200USD 2) Dont be in a hurry. We are used to US restuarants and keep waiting for fast and attentive.

This is haute cuisine at its best. Although, I am sure you would enjoy tasting any of the customary sushi-sashimi dishes, the price you pay at this restaurant is best justified by tasting the unique Japanese fusion entrees in the menu. For the first visit (believe me. You will return) the optimal way to immerse yourself into Chef Sanz's artistry is to order the KABUKI MENU. It is a 10 course ""degustacion"" menu (don't be afraid. each dish is sized reasonably) representing a true ""magic carpet"" ride through the culinary space of this audacious and creative chef.  We accompanied the menu with a choice from an impressive list of notable small champagne and cava wine producers.

Parking a car was a nightmare on Saturday night and I had to call the restaurant to inform them of 10-15 minutes delay. Thus, we run to reach the restaurant at 9:45.

Special recommendations for the suckling pig (tender, flavorful) and the corvina (possibly the best fish dish I ever had in a restaurant). After dessert, they brought out a small bottle of some digestive liqueur and little cubes of chocolate and coconut. A perfect “settle the stomach” course.

Tapas are place on the table for your acceptance. If you eat them you pay. I waved them away, including the olives on table when we arrived. Second time here over the past few years and each time we were treated like old customers and old friends by Sr. Esteban and staff. What gracious people and what good Spanish food. The gaspacho was memorable with goodies added as per your choice. Menu translations to English. Celebrities dine there on occasion according to pictures on the wall. We were seated at Queen Sofia's table and our picture was taken with Sr. Esteban included. The price was quite fair.

Boy did we luck out! We arrived around 20:30 and the restaurant was already full. Dinner is usually a late evening event in Spain. We wanted Paella and El Rincon de Estaban was listed as a restaurant with good ratings for paella. The restaurant was purchased by a great young couple (young by my standards), Jesus & Maira. Maira runs the front of the house and Jesus oversees the kitchen. The restaurant was lively with conversations and [mainly] locals and we immediately felt at home. The décor had a cozy feel with photos on all the walls from well know people who have eaten there. Our paella was cooked to perfection and the wine certainly didn't hurt the experience.

We booked for 30 people well in advance as thought it would be difficult to for anywhere to accomodate us and said we wanted to pay around 20 euros per head for food. It was to celebrate a 50th Birthday. Hotel recomended and as our hotel was fabulous we thought it would be fine. We were the only people in there and the actual restaurant had a lovely atmosphere. On the tables when we arrived were bowls of olives and bread sticks and they had carafes of still chilled water (tap not bottled). Only 8 of the 30 had starters and rest had mains only. The food was not good but we thought it was because there were a lot of us. They then brought round a shot glass of yellow stuff which was like parafin, we had not ordered this and assumed it was complimentary. No one had dessert. To our horror the bill came to 2500 euros 86 euros per head. They had charged us 90 euros for water, 350 euros for the olives, and 280 for the yellow stuff, none of which we had ordered. 2 x vodka and tonic 25 euros, and wine and beer ( i had one beer and no wine) total 680 euros. We are a very easy to please bunch of 40-50 year olds but felt like we had been mugged. it was a total set up. The price did not match the standard of food. They knocked off 45 euros for water when we complained but laughed at us. Needless to say the next night we went to a different restaurant, had great food, 3 courses and drinks etc for 25 euro a head! Highly recommend 'Suzannas' round the corner.

Big mistake! The paella was overcooked, dry, the rice was like eating peanuts. Funny thing is that the customers next to us, who had ordered paella for 4 enjoyed a very juicy and al dente paella so I guess they know how to make it, it’s just that in our case something went wrong in the kitchen. In that case, the chef should have just said it and offer an alternative if we were not willing to wait for another 30 minutes for a new paella. The fact that he served it shows unprofessionalism. To make things worse, when we placed our order, the waiter suggested to try housewine and we agreed. We were shocked to see that it was charged 25 euros in the bill since we had a very good labeled wine for 18 euros the previous time.

We walked for a few blocks and then instinct sent us down this small side street teeming with people. within a block we saw the pizza sign and took a chance. it was a tiny, narrow aisle of barstools, completely full when we arrived, but we quickly found two stools together at the counter and shortly enjoyed magnificent thin crust, lovely stringy cheese, layer of oil, pepperoni, basil, and mushrooms - all delicious and leaving us very satisfied (along with the yummy tomato, onion, olive, and herb salad). the proprietor spoke English well and was very welcoming. Water closet downstairs is a shared space and nice enough. sayings stenciled all over the walls and ceiling are enjoyable and entertaining.",2018-11-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1625680-Reviews-or10-Pizzeria_Vesuvio_Hortaleza-Madrid.html,UID_31292,0.019,0.675,0.306,0.9951,0.2648989898989899,0.5904040404040404,0.4478166666666666,826,56,0.0677966101694915,0,22,False,24,0.119047619047619,0.1904761904761904,0.2619047619047619,0.119047619047619,0.119047619047619,0.0,0.0476190476190476,0.0238095238095238,0.0714285714285714,0.0476190476190476,142,110,4.823943661971831,0,0,love surpris grand via taxi drop us hotel minut away citi center walk block instinct sent us small side street teem peopl within block saw pizza sign took chanc tini narrow aisl barstool complet full arriv quickli found two stool togeth counter shortli enjoy magnific thin crust love stringi chees layer oil pepperoni basil mushroom delici leav us satisfi along yummi tomato onion oliv herb salad proprietor spoke english well welcom water closet downstair share space nice enough say stencil wall ceil enjoy entertain,good review,4
