Our hotel recommended this restaurant as a good place for our last dinner in Spain. When we first got there (7pm) they were open but we couldn't find anyone who worked there (waitress etc) so we left and decided to come back later. We came back around 830. They made it seem like they were doing us a huge favor seating us without reservations. We were thankful they accommodated us. At no point during our 2 hour stay there did the place fill up. We asked the waiter for just an extra moment to decide our order. He disappeared for about 15 minutes. Been he reappeared, we ordered one glass of sangria, one water, and four tapas. Our sangria and two tapas came out quickly. The sangria tasted completely like syrup. It was awful. The fried fish and spinach pear salad were very good, though not unique. The two stars I give this place are for those two tapas The other two tapas did not come out until about a half hour after we finished the first two. By that point, we just wanted to be done. The last two tapas were eggplant and croquettes (two of my favorite tapas over our trip). They were pretty terrible. The eggplant was oddly prepared and the sauce way too overpowering. The croquettes seem like the type you buy in the frozen section of a supermarket, though saltier and mushier inside and not as tasty. We ate enough of each to say we were full and got the check. The check for one sangria, one water, four tapas was approx 45 euro!? Insane!! The pen would not work to sign the receipt but the girl did not get a new pen and said it did not matter if we signed or not. I am sorry our hotel would recommend people here. Interestingly enough, 100% of the clientele eating in the dining area were speaking English. This makes me think it is definitely a tourist trap.

Location is right on the Via Grande, in an area where I wouldn't expect to find such good food. Downstairs is a bustling tapas bar, and upstairs in the back is a sit-down type of restaurant. Got there a bit early for the restaurant, so we started out with a glass of good cava and a few tapas. The tapas were pretty good, but the restaurant was excellent. The room has a kind of modern yet rustic feel to it. As for the food, the Secreto Iberico was great, as were the habas. A terrific bottle of wine and a couple of tasty shared desserts completed the meal. The service was good, and the staff friendly.

It is very pleasant although small – a foyer-like space with three small tables just as you enter, and a larger room further in, which when we were there was occupied by one large table for a group.  The place has considerable charm with bare brick walls and a nice décor. The food is excellent, although not necessarily very French. So far so good. Food portions were enormous, with a big appetizer on the house, so a great place to bring a hungry teenager, but way too large helpings to be “elegant” or even appetizing. As far from nouvelle cuisine as you can get.  The main problem, though, was the service which was bordering on rude. For instance, we were asked to keep our cutlery between the free appetizer and the next course, because we ""were supposed to have eaten it with a spoon”. This appetizer, known as migas – a typically Spanish and tasty dish (in a “French” restaurant??) consisting of bread crumbs and a variety of other ingredients – was apparently meant to have been eaten from the plate it was served on with the two spoons that came with it, rather than from our individual plates as we did. And they bluntly refused to change the cutlery, although we were able to get new plates, after asking for it. Furthermore, the wine list is fairly limited to be a first-class French restaurant and the first two wines we ordered were not available. Finally the place is overpriced, not least the wines. Thus, to conclude, a small and cozy place in the heart of old Madrid, French in name only, with vast potential and excellent food, but suffering from unhelpful staff with over-inflated egos and ditto prices.",2013-01-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1097451-Reviews-La_Esquina_del_Real-Madrid.html,UID_37523,0.05,0.863,0.087,0.9114,0.1465639679469467,0.5132172791747258,0.3246142857142857,1722,144,0.0836236933797909,0,45,False,63,0.0714285714285714,0.125,0.2142857142857142,0.0535714285714285,0.1428571428571428,0.0357142857142857,0.0535714285714285,0.0535714285714285,0.1607142857142857,0.0892857142857142,305,197,4.642622950819672,0,0,visit restaur first likelihood last time christma pleasant although small foyer like space three small tabl enter larger room occupi one larg tabl group place consider charm bare brick wall nice cor food excel although necessarili french far good food portion enorm big appet hous great place bring hungri teenag way larg help eleg even appet far nouvel cuisin get main problem though servic border rude instanc ask keep cutleri free appet next cours suppos eaten spoon appet known miga typic spanish tasti dish french restaur consist bread crumb varieti ingredi appar meant eaten plate serv two spoon came rather individu plate bluntli refus chang cutleri although abl get new plate ask furthermor wine list fairli limit first class french restaur first two wine order avail final place overpr least wine thu conclud small cozi place heart old madrid french name vast potenti excel food suffer unhelp staff inflat ego ditto price,average review,3

This place knows entrecote (AKA New York strip). And the offering is as simple as that. 24 Euros get you a piece of meat, on a bed of herbal butter sauce placed on top of a warmer and fries. Salad, or to be specific, the dressing deserves it's own praise. I am not a big fan of leaves, but with their dressing I was tempted to lick the plate clean. So the only real choice is the level of steak doneness and the wine to assist the digest.  The place gets really busy, really fast and waiters (only 2 of them) do wonders to serve all.

There are no surprises as the menu is always the same you just have to pick how ur meat is cooked. Well this time was a bit disappointing to be honest as the staff were so loud with banging and carrying wine bottles fro lm the floor up to the ground floor were the tables are, just arranging plates with loud banging without any regards to the people dining. Honestly I didn’t feel valued as a customer. Furthermore it was the first time I got my meat covered with creamy sauce that we had to wait for a few minutes to melt but that meant our “saignant” meat would be more cooked !!  Would I recommend going there maybe if u are craving Entrocote but I have to warn you it was expensive as a table for 3 including one glass of house wine and no dessert came up to 80€ without the tip!

It looks good from the outside and does have nice decor. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to our expectations.  First of all, I had the ""Solomillo de Corzo"" which I do not think was from a Roe Deer (corzo). I am a hunter myself and have harvested several corzo and the solomillo's are tiny. This was probably a ""Solomillo de Ciervo"" from a Spanish red deer judging from the size of the piece of meat. It if was ""Solomillo de Corzo"" then it was from a giant Roe Deer. In any event, despite the nice sauce and presentation the meat was dry as venison tends to be unless cooked perfectly. This was not the case here. Also, we ordered the alcachofas (artichokes) and were again disappointed. They were nothing special and suffered in comparison with delectable and tasty artichokes I've had at other establishments. We also had the Huevos Rotos for an appetizer and they were good with Pimientos de Padrón (famous Padrón peppers) but again, nothing special.  The wine recommended to us was OK but again just nothing to rave about for 16.90 Euro. The desserts and coffee were also OK. I'm not sure I would spend the money to return to L'abbracio unless it was some matter of convenience and I needed to go to a restaurant nearby to my home. We spent 86 Euro for 2 persons and this reflected a 20% discount from El Tenedor.",2018-06-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991187-Reviews-L_Abbraccio-Madrid.html,UID_32436,0.061,0.864,0.075,0.5004,0.1675286023500309,0.5746456916099774,0.4426533333333333,1477,144,0.0974949221394719,0,41,False,36,0.0847457627118644,0.135593220338983,0.2033898305084746,0.0677966101694915,0.1016949152542373,0.0847457627118644,0.0677966101694915,0.0677966101694915,0.1016949152542373,0.0847457627118644,271,169,4.446494464944649,0,0,honest disappoint restaur pass mani time foot neighborhood quit close live look good outsid nice decor unfortun food live expect first solomillo de corzo think roe deer corzo hunter harvest sever corzo solomillo tini probabl solomillo de ciervo spanish red deer judg size piec meat solomillo de corzo giant roe deer event despit nice sauc present meat dri venison tend unless cook perfectli case also order alcachofa artichok disappoint noth special suffer comparison delect tasti artichok establish also huevo roto appet good pimiento de padr n famou padr n pepper noth special wine recommend us ok noth rave euro dessert coffe also ok sure would spend money return l abbracio unless matter conveni need go restaur nearbi home spent euro person reflect discount el tenedor,bad review,2

It was very close to our hotel as well which made things easier. Although we arrived at 8:30 p.m. the place was really empty as the Spanish people tend to eat very late compared to Canadians. My wife had the crispy leg of lamb which was very overcooked and really seemed to be deep fried? To bad as the reviews were very good on this item. I had a Carpaccio of sea bass and prawn which was amazing. It was so good my wife shared it with me. I had stuffed ravioli as a main that was also very tasty.  We enjoyed a very nice bottle of wine and the owners also gave us a free liquor after our meal. we considered the price reasonable at 89 Euros. I asked a server if the total included a tip and she assured me it did so we left thinking this was what was done in Spain, however not long afterward I read online that what I thought was the tip was in fact the VAT/ I returned the next day and in very broken Spanish apologized to the owner and left an appropriate tip for the server.

I *almost* changed our reservation to a place closer to our accommodations but I’m SO SO SO GLAD I didn’t do that! From the minute we stepped inside we were treated like every last person from the host to the chef to the waitstaff was genuinely happy to have us there.  Our server Rachel was a delight - from her attentive service throughout to her fantastically wonderful personality- she made our night so special.  Every last one of our dishes were incredible. The burrata and tomatoes were heavenly, fried artichokes tasty, risotto with truffle DIVINE, pasta perfectly al dente, pork falling off the bone delicious and last but not least the ‘turkey dinner’ we were surprised to learn they were offering as a Thanksgiving-themed dish was out of this WORLD (my husband was very happy). The cocktails are creative and yummy and chocolate dessert capped off a perfect night with our teenagers that we will never forget.

Put several hours of your agenda on this visit rather than driving. It is amazing that an authentic adobe oven fed with Spanish oak wood functions in the middle of the city. It is all authentic. The interior is not modern chick, more like you find in a rustic restaurant in the Segovia province. You want true heart of Spain feel here you find it. Even the customers are mostly Spanish and connoiseurs of good lamb. Just like in those restaurants the menu is not a smorgasbor of items. Here you come for the roast, and their lamb is the best . It may be equaled but nor surpassed. The meat is tender, moist and juicy. It is accompanied by a lettuce and tomato salad. In our case for starters we took their blood pudding (morcilla) and croquetes as well as some La Granja beans and it was satiating. The great meat portions are perhaps excessive for standard American habits, specially for lunch but come in with after a very light breakfast and be prepared to skip dinner. Very few people we know could cope with the full meal and need further sustenance the rest of the day. The house wine is just right for this type of dinner and the homemade bread and white tablecloths retain that homey feeling. The service was extremely efficient even though they had a full house.  The restaurant is not in a fashionable, yet safe, neighborhood and the hotel across the street provides parking. For the visitor it would be easier to take a taxi or, cheaper and faster yet, the subway with a station two blocks away . It is fantastic to experience real Spanish roast, at reasonable prices and because it has received an extremely favorable report from Madrid TV a reservation is necessary.  My rating is relative to other grill houses or asadores anywhere. This a problem with tripadvisor where there are no categories and an absolute scale does not exist. Yet, if you want a super tasty meal and you are a roasted lamb lover the ranking applies. No frills, molecular cuisine or modern colorful presentations, just plain good food from down the farm in a feast day.",2015-09-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d795439-Reviews-Asador_Cristobal-Madrid.html,UID_37556,0.026,0.822,0.152,0.9949,0.2331273620559334,0.4746390778533636,0.4342260869565218,2196,191,0.0869763205828779,0,38,False,69,0.1037735849056603,0.1698113207547169,0.320754716981132,0.0377358490566037,0.2075471698113207,0.0188679245283018,0.0188679245283018,0.0377358490566037,0.0471698113207547,0.0377358490566037,397,251,4.528967254408061,0,0,want best milk fed babi lamb roast way eon mani segovia villag place put sever hour agenda visit rather drive amaz authent adob oven fed spanish oak wood function middl citi authent interior modern chick like find rustic restaur segovia provinc want true heart spain feel find even custom mostli spanish connoiseur good lamb like restaur menu smorgasbor item come roast lamb best may equal surpass meat tender moist juici accompani lettuc tomato salad case starter took blood pud morcilla croquet well la granja bean satiat great meat portion perhap excess standard american habit special lunch come light breakfast prepar skip dinner peopl know could cope full meal need susten rest day hous wine right type dinner homemad bread white tablecloth retain homey feel servic extrem effici even though full hous restaur fashion yet safe neighborhood hotel across street provid park visitor would easier take taxi cheaper faster yet subway station two block away fantast experi real spanish roast reason price receiv extrem favor report madrid tv reserv necessari rate rel grill hous asador anywher problem tripadvisor categori absolut scale exist yet want super tasti meal roast lamb lover rank appli frill molecular cuisin modern color present plain good food farm feast day,good review,4

Feels French and for folks in Madrid and it’s more of a locals’ place than a tourist place and yet it’s a tourist place too. I still can’t figure it out – but I believe that the only thing the restaurant serves is steak frites. The frites, which on the Saturday lunch I visited, were unlimited (not really necessary on this end) but they were delicious. The steak was a bit tough and low quality though I adored the butter sauce. I didn’t love the place enough to linger over dessert and another glass of wine – it’s a chain that’s in Dubai as well as other places and you feel that.  It's only fair to say that the place was packed with locals, so clearly it's popular.

He was very accommodating and we worked through everything with the help of another waiter for one question.  The bread was very good as was a ham snack (I think it was pork belly) and fresh green olives.

If the review was based on just the tortilla is would get 5 stars. But in a city where a pint of beer is usally 2-3 euros, charging €7 is just mental. Not to mention where everywhere else, when serving a pint, serves a European pint (568 ml), this place serves 'American pints', which are actually 20% smaller, a fact that I don't think most people realise. So both combined makes for a very expensive pint. So for that 1 star is removed. Not to mention a spirit and mixer will set you back around €13, so spirits are ridiculously expensive too. On the weekends this place is absolutely rammed, so you'll usually have to stand. I'm taking another star off because during the week, when it isn't that buzy, they don't have enough chairs to match the number of tables; so you have people needlessly standing up, very often seeing one table with one poor bloke standing whilst the rest are seated.  The takeaway ordering is very quick though and it's great that you can pre-order a whole tortilla to take away with you. One note I would make is that whilst it opens at 1800, it doesn't start serving food till 1900.",2017-12-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7935317-Reviews-or40-Pez_Tortilla-Madrid.html,UID_37570,0.039,0.887,0.074,0.8404,0.036231884057971,0.483768115942029,0.3393400000000001,1260,110,0.0873015873015873,0,41,False,42,0.1351351351351351,0.1891891891891892,0.2972972972972973,0.054054054054054,0.1621621621621621,0.027027027027027,0.027027027027027,0.027027027027027,0.054054054054054,0.027027027027027,236,157,4.338983050847458,0,0,love good tortilla eaten time yet bad one brie one serv ever day amaz review base tortilla would get star citi pint beer usal euro charg mental mention everywher els serv pint serv european pint ml place serv american pint actual smaller fact think peopl realis combin make expens pint star remov mention spirit mixer set back around spirit ridicul expens weekend place absolut ram usual stand take anoth star week buzi enough chair match number tabl peopl needlessli stand often see one tabl one poor bloke stand whilst rest seat takeaway order quick though great pre order whole tortilla take away one note would make whilst open start serv food till,average review,3

Most Spanish people will tell you their granny's tortilla is best. But I suppose that's because they haven't happened upon Pez Tortilla on Calle Pez in the heart of hipster Malasaña. And it's unlikely she adds brie and truffle to hers (my personal favourite).  Here there is a wide variety of different fillings - or you can have the traditional basic tortilla. They're served gooey with many morsels of bread to soak up the delights. Helpfully, there are also several different beers to sample alongside your culinary exquisite take on peasant food and the hustle and bustle busy environment adds to the authentic Spanish vibe. It's loud with chatter and you're lucky to find a perch, but that all doesn't really matter as the food and the ambience does the trick.

It is very much a locals area, which is very vibrant and packed with restaurants and bars.  Given the virtually unlimited choice, I asked Trip Advisor which suggested Pez - which looked right up my alley. A few blocks walk and I was there - as were a lot of people. It was jam packed - it's not very big! Positioning myself near the bar, it took about 10 minutes to be served - selecting one of their ales of the day and two croquettes. I couldn't translate the varieties, so the bar attendant selected cheese for me. The beer and croquettes were a great combination - for €5! Given Pez prides itself on tortilla - I had to sample one and went for the first one on the menu - I could read ham and cheese, so that sounded good enough. The tortilla is a large slice, served with two slices of bread. It was delicious - also combined with another IPA selection to wash it down! Muchos gracias Pez for feeding a solo traveller. Note - it is full of twenty-somethings that all spoke Spanish, so very much a locals scene. Do yourself a favour and head to Pez when in Madrid.",2017-05-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7935317-Reviews-or50-Pez_Tortilla-Madrid.html,UID_37602,0.008,0.908,0.084,0.9603,0.2613071895424836,0.406868490986138,0.3363769230769231,1179,106,0.0899067005937235,3,34,False,49,0.0625,0.1875,0.5,0.0625,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,226,139,4.216814159292035,0,0,recommend colleagu head justicia district area north call gran via much local area vibrant pack restaur bar given virtual unlimit choic ask trip advisor suggest pez look right alley block walk lot peopl jam pack big posit near bar took minut serv select one ale day two croquett translat varieti bar attend select chees beer croquett great combin given pez pride tortilla sampl one went first one menu could read ham chees sound good enough tortilla larg slice serv two slice bread delici also combin anoth ipa select wash mucho gracia pez feed solo travel note full twenti someth spoke spanish much local scene favour head pez madrid,very good review,5

Oh and the bill is quite high, but that too you should know because the price doesn't vary that much from one place to another. Now, I have been in several Entrecôte restaurants, and this one had its pleasant surprises and its disappointments. The salad was disappointing, the vinaigrette was too strong and well, there was no ""noix""... The meat was delicious and tender and melted in your mouth, it was excellent. The sauce however was good but not amazingly so, it was too heavy, it was flooded with butter, just too much of it. The french fries were delicious, and quite addictive!

All these restaurants have the same menu and sauce, but are independently owned. We were greeted by the owner, who explained that “many try to imitate the sauce” used in L’Entrecote Cafe de Paris, but none can replicate it. The sauce is made by one person for all the restaurants. L’Entrecote Cafe de Paris only serves steak with a special secret sauce (which is absolutely delicious and the reason you should visit). There are two sides: french fries and salad . There are a variety of desserts and are all made in house (I had Spanish Torrijas and found them to be yummy).

We had to attract the attention of a waiter to take our drinks order bearing in mind that the restaurant was not particularly busy at the time of our booking. Drinks having arrived, we were pretty much ignored until we were able to catch the eye of a waitress who was brilliant in every way i.e. efficient friendly and attentive. I have to say that she pretty much was doing the job of two people. The waiter who was on a slow and stop mission managed to lock himself out of the restaurant much to our amusement but not that of the person in charge of the restaurant. There were a lot of home deliveries flying out the door and also people coming by to collect their take-out orders. We were served our salad which was pretty much what you would expect a salad to be followed by our steak which was individually cooked to our liking and which was very good indeed covered by the 'special' sauce. The fries on the first round were not particularly hot but the ones brought out for the second service were and you were allowed as much as you wanted.

Serving a set menu daily with salad to start might not be every ones idea of a hearty lunch, but it certainly struck a cord with us. The Green salad had a fabulous dressing which made the dish mor appetising, then came the main course. Pork Fillet in a mustard sauce/dressing which was placed on a burner, once melted then it was ready to serve with thin fries. Absolutely delicious, and we had to plead with them in the end to stop bringing the fries out. The idea was to use up the sauce/dressing with the fries which was great.

The padrón peppers at the side of the dishes proved to be a mix of mild and superhot: padrón peppers can be mild (2/3 of them) or extremely hot. Tourists should know that eating a mild one is no guarantee that the next one will be mild too: taking a tiny test bite of each is imperative unless you want to risk losing your taste buds for the rest of your meal.  When we complained, the restaurant manager, the only one who spoke some English, was responsive, but not apologetic: that is how it is, the traditional local steak has a lot of fat, and so does the suckling pig. And Spaniards like the suspense of ‘what’s this padrón going to be like?’ Fuenta la Fama caters to locals as well as to tourists. As we entered a middle-aged Spanish couple was being greeted by the Maître D’ they clearly knew. But the room we were seated in was mostly filled with tourists, including a group of more than 20 English high school students and their teachers. It may well be difficult to please both groups. As we were in the tourist category, we would have liked a waiter who speaks at least some English and is able to educate us, particularly about the padrón roulette.",2014-10-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2719531-Reviews-or50-Fuente_De_La_Fama-Madrid.html,UID_37648,0.039,0.875,0.086,0.9364,0.0805208333333333,0.3968229166666668,0.30073,1508,136,0.0901856763925729,0,35,False,45,0.1041666666666666,0.0208333333333333,0.2291666666666666,0.0208333333333333,0.1041666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.1041666666666666,0.0625,0.2083333333333333,0.1041666666666666,282,184,4.343971631205674,0,0,oz local steak say descript dish menu color photo outsid less half edibl becam clear stab around tri find tasti meat amidst fat suckl pig dish mostli white gelatin fat thin strip tasti meat swim soup greas padr n pepper side dish prove mix mild superhot padr n pepper mild extrem hot tourist know eat mild one guarante next one mild take tini test bite imper unless want risk lose tast bud rest meal complain restaur manag one spoke english respons apologet tradit local steak lot fat suckl pig spaniard like suspens padr n go like fuenta la fama cater local well tourist enter middl age spanish coupl greet tre clearli knew room seat mostli fill tourist includ group english high school student teacher may well difficult pleas group tourist categori would like waiter speak least english abl educ us particularli padr n roulett,average review,3

Grilled red peppers and grilled asparagus were good starters, and left us hungry enough to greatly enjoy the exceptional quarter lamb for two (40€); very young lamb slow roasted to fork tenderness then finished in a hot oven to crisp the skin, served family style. No additional seasoning needed, except for the garlic slivers tucked here and there in the decent sized portion of lamb. Rice pudding was typical of the region, a bit runny and with more cinnamon than we like, and dairy/egg style tart unremarkable but good. Service was no-frills, professional and deft. For some reason, there was a 10% discount for dinner on the Wednesday night in May we dined.

Being used to eating somewhat earlier than seems popular locally, we made the mistake of reserving our table for 8.30 p.m. - probably an hour earlier than we should have done. Anyway, the restaurant looks fine from outside, and helpfully displays a multi-lingual Menu. Inside is quite ""traditional"", with space for about 60 people - one wall in the rectangular layout is all mirrors, which is a little disconcerting initially. We got a reasonable welcome, and were allowed select a table - a good start to the evening. English language skills are not one of the strengths here, but we got through the ordering process with a mixture of our ""poquito"" of Espanol and our Waiter's smidgen of English! We decided to share a plate of Iberian Ham as a Starter, my ""Better Half"", M. selected Roast Suckling Pig for a Main, and I opted for the Escallop of Veal. We also ordered a bottle of ""Albarino"" to accompany our meal. As is customary in several restaurants we visited, we were served what I call a ""pre-starter"" - I can't say what was in this sausage-like concoction (and language limitations prevented a description by staff), but whatever it was, it proved quite tasty. Our wine was delivered - no displaying of the Bottle or offer of a taste before it was poured into our glasses - and it was satisfactory. The ""Iberian Ham"" was what it said it was, without being distinctive as regards texture or flavour. M's ""Roast Suckling Pig"" was reasonable too - it probably wasn't the wisest choice on her part, as she doesn't like fat, but she acknowledged that the meat at the core was ""good"". My ""Escallop of Veal"" was excellent - served in the Milanese style (in light batter), it was cooked appropriately, and was all the more tasty when I requested a slice of Lemon as an accompaniment. We noted, by the way, that other customers began to arrive from 9.15 p.m. onwards, and undoubtedly their presence improved the atmosphere in the restaurant. Our Bill (before gratuity) came to Euro 79-40, and we departed fairly satisfied - our basic comments on ""Fuente de la Fama"" are that their offering is safe & traditional (with meat the best option), portion sizes are good, service is courteous, and prices are reasonable.",2014-06-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2719531-Reviews-or50-Fuente_De_La_Fama-Madrid.html,UID_1728,0.023,0.845,0.132,0.9938,0.3089460784313725,0.4911764705882352,0.3676,2390,192,0.0803347280334728,1,98,False,69,0.1206896551724138,0.1379310344827586,0.3620689655172414,0.0517241379310344,0.1551724137931034,0.0172413793103448,0.0172413793103448,0.0172413793103448,0.0689655172413793,0.0517241379310344,416,262,4.747596153846154,0,0,restaur call atocha recommend us within walk distanc great hotel catalonia la cort arrang book saturday night use eat somewhat earlier seem popular local made mistak reserv tabl p probabl hour earlier done anyway restaur look fine outsid help display multi lingual menu insid quit tradit space peopl one wall rectangular layout mirror littl disconcert initi got reason welcom allow select tabl good start even english languag skill one strength got order process mixtur poquito espanol waiter smidgen english decid share plate iberian ham starter better half select roast suckl pig main opt escallop veal also order bottl albarino accompani meal customari sever restaur visit serv call pre starter say sausag like concoct languag limit prevent descript staff whatev prove quit tasti wine deliv display bottl offer tast pour glass satisfactori iberian ham said without distinct regard textur flavour roast suckl pig reason probabl wisest choic part like fat acknowledg meat core good escallop veal excel serv milanes style light batter cook appropri tasti request slice lemon accompani note way custom began arriv p onward undoubtedli presenc improv atmospher restaur bill gratuiti came euro depart fairli satisfi basic comment fuent de la fama offer safe tradit meat best option portion size good servic courteou price reason,good review,4

Frankly I'd pay €20 for the morcilla alone. You also get a very generous helping of fresh baked foccacia-style bread. ***ALERT*** don't overdo it on the bread - you'll need the room. # Main course of either suckling pig or milk-fed lamb. The menu actually specifies the lamb but in practice they let you have either so a couple can share both. The meat is cooked in a wood burning oven on an earthenware dish and is seasoned just with salt and lemon juice. The sauce is simply the cooking juices let down with a little water - they should serve it in wine glasses... The lamb is delicately flavoured as milk-fed lamb tends to be but succulent and beautiful. The pork is simply sublime - full flavoured, wonderful crackling - the latter even included the little curly tail. The meat is served with a simple lettuce/tomato/onion salad (a huge bowl full) with a nice, simple dressing. # Desert is quoted as being the local special (effectively a mille feuille) but the waiter said we could have whatever desert we wanted from the menu. We stuck with the special which was ok, nothing more, but frankly we were stuffed anyway. # A bottle of decent rebeira (between 2) # A local liqueur with little hard sweet pastry balls to soak in it. # Coffee # Very friendly and attentive service from someone who wanted to make sure we had a great time despite neither of us speaking any Spanish beyond 'hola' 'dos cerveza' and 'vino tinto'.

Having had to forgo our planned and much anticipated return to the tapas bars of central madrid due to the above meteorological conditons we entered this bastion of spanish chain cuisine with some trepidation........ok enough waxing lyrecisms (is that really a word?). Review - choose from lamb or entrecote (or suckling pig on wednesdays and fridays but don,t expect any on a early friday evening (early for madrid that is) as this bustling restaurant with one other table had sold out!!! Starter a shared revuelto with setas and jamon iberico was ok but finding any jamon was...well needles in a haystack springs to mind...and at 12 euros for flavoured scramble eggs... it should be ok! The roast lamb, their thing, ok but when thats all you cook (besides a plain steak) it should be good and roasting a small joint in a wood oven till it falls off the bone is not really rocket science! The chulletas or i should say chulletitas (thats small, very small lamb cutlets) are served in their own dish on top of smoking coals, bit gimmiky but ok if you like that sort of thing. However as they are cut only slightly thicker than an ice cream wafer (if that) theres no worry of finding any blushing pink succulent meat as they are cooked and the towel thrown in as soon as they come in sight of a grill ! The entrecote, well yes a nice piece of meat with a pinch of salt as its adornement and garnished with two pieces of red pepper and half a grilled tomato again not really challenging when thats all you offer your customers! The cutlets by the way were accompanied by.......... a nice white plate to which you could transfer them but forget the knife or fork as the only way to locate and remove what meat there is, is by hand! Add on: a salad served in a bowl reminiscent of what i user to eat my cornflakes out of and consisting of lettuce, tomato AND topped with some raw onion at 6.50 a time, a bottle of very average house red and two cafe solos - with a bill topping over nearly 70 euros you have to ask yourself does this represent value for money and would you go back...... the answer.......well you decide!

Most every dish was sold out, so be sure to get there early if you have your heart set on a specific tortilla. The tortillas too, I might add aren't the tortillas we are thinking of, if you are from California. Their dishes were more like a frittata. An egg batter mix with filling inside.

First off, we were only given the a la carte menu, and had to request the set menu which arrived slightly grudgingly. Then, when clearly choosing from the set menu, the waiter said that there was a special of the day, roast lamb, for 2 or 3. We chose to have that, for three, initially assuming that it was a smallish portion as part of the set menu. However, when a huge plate of lamb arrived, suspicions were aroused that we had been covertly ""sold up"". The bill confirmed this: the lamb was charged in two items at 18 and 47 Euros, against a 3 Euro per head reduction in the set menu price. Querying this, we were told that this was 47 for the two portions and 18 for the single portion, and that he had asked us if we wanted 2 or 3 portions. Setting aside the extremely peculiar arithmetic between the two figures, it's sad that restaurants and waiters feel that this sort of thing is fair game with foreigners, and it marred an otherwise excellent meal.

We arrived early enough to get a free table as we hadn't made a reservation. We were met by the unfriendly host and seated at a small table. He didn't offer to take our coats as he did with every other table he seated. We were given the menus and received no advise or explanations.  The menu is pricy. We ordered for starters a plat of Iberico ham which was expensive but excellent, as well as a plate of peppers. These were straight out of a jar and cost €5!  For mains we ordered lamb chops and received just that, 5 chops each on a mini grill on the table. The waiter, knowing we are tourists and probably first timers, never asked if we would like to order some potatoes or salad with the meat as it doesn't come with anything. And we ordered a bottle of Pesquera for nearly €30 and it tasted like it was kept in the oven all summer. So stick to house wine if you do decide to go. I have to say the lamb chops were some of the tastiest and tender I've ever had. All and all, it was hard to still enjoy the meal with my wife and not get annoyed.

Mine was lost/stolen 10 minutes after arriving in Sevilla. We went to the Asador because it was literally around the corner from the Meliá Galgos hotel, closest accommodations to the Embassy. The space was welcoming, warm, decorated in what I would call España-iana. We both had the prix fixe. The appetizers were a superb selection of charcuterie, including wonderful blood sausages, hard to find in the US. I mentioned to our server that I was not fond of lamb, and there was a prompt substitution for suckling pig, as good if not better than the famed dish from Segovia. Heavenly.

The Dougall's Raquera and the Leyenda. Both were really good. The croquetas: I ordered a jamon iberico and curry de pollo, the ham one was great but the curry de pollo was a very interesting flavor as I had never tried curry in a croqueta. Both were good stuff, just wait a little for them to get warm because they're served hot since they're made in the moment.

Small place, nice ambiance for a warm, happy group of young people all chatting away and enjoying several types of draft beer. Seating is limited. We ordered beer, tortilla (they offer half a dozen flavours), and two types of croquetas. The beer and slice of omelette is ready immediately and quite tasty. The bill was wrong at first as the bartender charged us for a racion (7€) when we only ordered a duo (2€). No biggie. But 25 minutes later, still no croquetas and stretching toward 10pm. Their tiny kitchen was overtaxed? As the menu only included two types of food and no other tapas, this place is really only suitable for appetizers before dinner, and no way to stretch four or five appetizers into a light dinner. Eventually we left (having never received our croquetas but for 4€ not a great loss) and went to another restaurant for a more substantial meal.

I've been coming here for years and all I can say is that it gets better. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and the staff serving our table couldn't have been more attentive and professional. A total of 6 waiters rotated to serve our entrees and to collect the dishes, as we devoured them. The menu of the day included roasted peppers, blood sausages, chorizos coupled with a cup of lamb broth, which was outstanding .The lamb was served with a tossed salad, followed by two outstanding and large desserts: cheese flan with raspberries and a cake with milhojas. A bottle of an incredible red wine was also part of the deal, followed by a herbal liqueur with rosquillas de anís. Total for two was $75 Euros. A steal for what you get .

It has sidewalk tables as well as bar type stools and a full dinning room. We enjoyed sitting at the counter where you can see the many variety of tapas displayed in front of you, and also get to enjoy seeing tapas being ordered by others that was not on display. People are interactive, and the service people are amazing in their ability to keep track of the many orders. The variety of food was plentiful, and very reasonably priced. Many of the tapas were priced at 2+ Euros (about $2.70 USD). They were also listed on a very large menu board, as well as smaller hand menus with the many different choices. Both my wife an I enjoy the tasting wine, and that too was offered for about the same price per glass. Needless to say we imbibed repeatedly. The place is narrow at its opening and gets packed with people earlier than most restaurants. It's a great meeting place and a very active social location.  It is located on the Calle Gran Via, which is in the heart of the city and offers many pleasant architectural views.  One of our favorites dishes, which we savored in several different restaurants as well as this one, but always enjoyed, was the Pimentos Padron. They are small Pablano green peppers that are sautéed in oil, and then coated with sea salt. They are served in bunches of about 30-40 pieces and are very reasonably priced. We also enjoyed the many different small Tapas of crisp bread and choices of meats, and vegetables.

It was not so complicated as the neighbourhood is full of cafes and restaurants of all kind (a lot of Japanese-Korean restaurants, by the way). Monday night not all of them was welcoming as we agreed to go to a place where we see lot of people: the most important rule for a tourist when he/she is looking for a place where local people go - it means quality, good atmosphere etc. We were not mistaken: first night we tried the upstairs-part of the place, which is a normal ""comedor"" with seats and tables. The menu is easy to read, also the wine list was clear and not overwhelming- was easy to choose from the range they had. The food is absolutely OK, we were looking for typical spanish meal: asparagus, pimientos del padrón, solomillo, chuletilla, etc...was perfect after a long day, spending hours on a plane.  The next day we came back at lunchtime for tapas and at night, again, but this time sitting only at the big bar-tables, having 2-3 tapas and a ""racion"" with 2-3 glasses of wine.

But we really went for the quiet and cosy restaurant which lies behind the bar (on de la Reina street). The room is much more quieter, has dark colours but abundant light. The service was very friendly. The dishes were really great. From the starters you MUST try ""Salteado de habitas tiernas con jamón Ibérico y huevos del corral"" (Sautéed tender green beans with Iberian ham and 2 fried wggs on top) which is so simple in preparation and so astonishing in taste at the same time. For main, I had the ""Solomillo de ternera a la plancha con patatas fritas"" (tender prime sirloin steak with fried potatoes) which was amazingly tender, juicy and tasty, maybe one of the most delicious stakes I have ever tried. My wife had the ""Chuletillas de cordero lechal de Aranda"" (lamb cutlets with fried potatoes).

What we found was a vibrant tapas bar that was trendy, yet laid back.  We grabbed a spot on the side near the entrance and ordered a few things (Jamón ibérico, green fried asparagus & brie cheese on bread, wild mushrooms with goats cheese on bread, fried jalapeno and cheese croquettes, Gildas (anchovy with olives & green pepper)) and washed it all down with a glass of sangria each. The food we ordered was fantastic (and not too expensive either). Unfortunately we both found that though the free tapa provided with our sangria tasted nice, it had to have been the thickest, creamiest potato salad I've ever seen - so for our health's sake, we pushed that to the side.

The decor is nice and the table settings are interesting. The wait staff is friendly in person, but they walk about the room stiffly, as if in the army, and they scan the room with such an intent stare that it feels like an army reconnaissance mission. For a more enjoyable evening they should relax a bit. Other fine dining restaurants can do that, so why not this one as well. The food was good but not great. Certainly not for a restaurant aspiring to have a Michelin star (as the brothers who run this restaurant have a two Michelin star restaurant in Barcelona). We shared the cochinillo asado (roast suckling pig) which was good, but certainly not in the class of the cochinillos we have had at other restaurants throughout Spain. The meat was relatively dry with insufficient juices to baste it with. The apple puree that cam with it was too sour. We also shared the cabrito (baby goat meat) which was indeed very good. For a wine we had a nice Pesquera crianza from the Ribera del Duero region.

They're friendly and considerate, yet loud when passing through orders, it's part of the experience . The food was just perfect and truly delicious. The prices are actually economically friendly.

Was pleased overall with the meal, sampling their partridge salad and garlic shrimp as starters, with sea bass as the main course. After spending my summer eating the freshest possible fish in Galicia, I was unsure about the quality of fish we would be served. I can honestly say it is one of the best pieces of fish that I've eaten in my life - extremely fresh and perfectly done, simply accompanied by garlic and olive oil. Next time I want to try the milanesa (breaded cutlet), which looks to be the house specialty. Only complaint is that it's a tad on the pricey side, particularly the garlic shrimp.

Signature dishes: Beef Tartar spread everything offered on each slice & roll it up....the giant tomato with basil...we had around 15 different menu options.

The food was very fusion (think Japanese style with Spanish ingredients) and creative in presentation. We are used to these restaurants in Asia so nothing came as a surprise. Having said that I loved the meat they served which was of top quality.  The one-man band waiter (a very talkative fellow!) tried his best to serve all twelve guests at the large communal table. Like a Japanese sushi chef, he used a mini fire torch to grill raw beef right in front of us in the tiny gap between the diners. He also served wine like a sommelier. A true asset to any restaurant I must say. To talk (about what) or not to talk with the fellow diners at the long table was stressful enough. The space was cramp and minimalist. It reminded me of the back kitchen of a butcher house. We were aware of the set up before we booked. But to be actually sitting in there was another story altogether. I had wanted to leave the moment we sat down. Our dining experience lasted 40 minutes, and we finished up and left. The bill for two with two glasses of house wine came to be 95€. Not cheap at all for a quick dinner.  On our way out, we saw a queue forming outside the tiny restaurant.

The place was recommended to us by a local friend. Quite a few of the dishes from Sala de Despiece would without a doubt fit 100% in a Michelin star menu. Yes the music is louder than necessary (and I usually hate that) but the food both in terms of presentation and taste and the service is so much above what you would expect from a small counter serving place that is easy to accept the music. I guess if the setting was more ""fine dining"" like (no stereotypical loud American tourist telling her life story 5 seats away at counter, table dining, soft music, ambiance lighting etc....) the place would get one Michelin star. I am not suggesting in any way that they should move towards the fine dining setting as it is a great to have such place where the food is so much better than what the setting would suggest.

Couple of personal photos of the food attached, they don’t do it full justice though. If you don’t book, you have to wait for an area to become available in the bar - however if you have booked you get escorted out of the restaurant into a room next door (a little like a speakeasy) where you sit at a communal table for 12 people which is a little less buzzy than the bar but was a great atmosphere none the less.

I made a reservation but did not know what I was up to. There are two parts to the place: one where customers are served on a first-come-first-serve basis and a separate one where access is gained through reservations. When we arrived we were quickly escorted back on the street and then to a small door and to another through a rickety corridor. The door opens into a small room where a large white lucite table lit from below can host the whole of 12 people. The room is a former butcher’s refrigerator with insulated quilted walls and a red rubber floor, a very original place one would expect in Berlin. The food is ordered and served a la carte, each portion with a certain price , sushi-style. Our server (was he the chef, too?) was very attentive and choreographed how each portion should be eaten to all of us. The food was terrific and creative and you tell a lot of thought had gone into it. There are two seatings, at least, for dinner: in the end it became clear that the waiter was late for the next shift and we felt rushed. Dessert came without berries and literally on the way out. In spite of this glitch this is a place I would recommend to anyone interested in more contemporary and creative assortments and presentations of food.",2018-10-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5037395-Reviews-or40-Sala_de_Despiece-Madrid.html,UID_18802,0.017,0.852,0.131,0.9838,0.1602639751552795,0.4771739130434782,0.3551076923076923,1333,123,0.0922730682670667,0,28,False,45,0.0697674418604651,0.1162790697674418,0.2790697674418604,0.0232558139534883,0.1860465116279069,0.0465116279069767,0.0465116279069767,0.0232558139534883,0.1395348837209302,0.0697674418604651,245,157,4.444897959183673,0,0,must admit found place youtub video great suggest made reserv know two part place one custom serv first come first serv basi separ one access gain reserv arriv quickli escort back street small door anoth ricketi corridor door open small room larg white lucit tabl lit host whole peopl room former butcher refriger insul quilt wall red rubber floor origin place one would expect berlin food order serv la cart portion certain price sushi style server chef attent choreograph portion eaten us food terrif creativ tell lot thought gone two seat least dinner end becam clear waiter late next shift felt rush dessert came without berri liter way spite glitch place would recommend anyon interest contemporari creativ assort present food,good review,4

Walls with covering that has the appearance of cheap corkboard, the main long wall facing the bar covered with huge photographs of seafood which only serve to emphasise the awkward shape of the room. Initially, we were alone and asked for the very loud disco music (BeeGees!) to be turned down. The tall thin (one of two) girl said she would, until more customers came in, when she would have to raise the volume so that neighbours could not overhear each other's conversations - now that's an original excuse! The lighting is appalling, glaring and bright, and very unflattering. Indeed as the place filled up it became very noisy, the shape of the room making for poor acoustics. What about the food? Well - that's ok, even pretty good. Trendy tiny portions on trendy china or slate, and prices in inverse proportion to the portions. This is my idea of hell in catering - pretentious, arrogant and with no attempt to make the experience a good one for the client. I rate the service as ""poor"" because of the arrogance.

Having booked a table for 10pm, we arrived at the door to be greeted by nobody and eventually walked up the a lady who seemed to be dealing with seating guests. We announced that we had made a reservation for 2 people at 10pm to be told sternly that she had no record of the reservation. I produced email evidence showing that the restaurant had confirmed the reservation, at which the lady made us feel like it was somehow our fault and tried to shift attention to the fact that sometimes guests receive an automated email but that does not guarantee reservation. So I then showed her both the automated email and the follow up one CONFIRMING the reservation, at which point there was still no apology and the best they could do was offer us a place at the bar (still no apology) and try to seat us within half an hour. Needless to say, I made my feelings clear to the lady and walked out given that a restaurant like this never deserves to have the custom of people it treats with such disdain. It's one thing to make an error with the reservation, and another to be rude to them and make them feel as if it's somehow your fault for trying to book in advance and eat at their restaurant.

Not every restaurant would do this, so it was really appreciated. All the dishes we had were excellent and were very well presented. Service was spot on.

The old rustic interior helped us settle into traditional Spanish meal mode. Old paintings and pictures of bullfighting and Hemingway on the walls . Food was no frills, simple, and most importantly, delicious.  Started off great with some croquettes and vermouth. Although the rabo de toro was great (tender and fall off the bone), the breaded hake fish was our favorite. Just the right tenderness and simple seasoning. A must have! The fried chicken with sauce paired with garlic cauliflower was also good. Our party also had veal steaks which were tender and juicy. My son doesn’t normally finish a steak in the 8 to 12 ounce size but he finished his steak no problem. As always in Spain in general, potatoes are done well and crispy. Would recommend the pistachio ice cream for dessert. The flan was a little stiffer than we’re used to. Must be a Madrid thing.  I have to admit that the menu isn’t really a fancy gastronomic breakthrough by modern restaurant standards, the food was simply delicious and well-prepared with pride and love.

There is no way that the same person who cooked oxtail stew for Tony Bourdain could have been the same person who cooked mine. The dish I was served was quite mediocre and, I can still not really quite believe this, was served with canned mushrooms and peas. The carrots may have been cooked fresh. My husband ordered grilled veal. It arrived undercooked and under seasoned. The fries that came with it were also under salted. Our son order eggs scrambled with ham and potatoes. Believe it or not, they actually put fries in his scrambled eggs. He hardly ate any of it. It was like some kind of a bad joke. I have no idea why people flock to this restaurant.

'Modern' or 'fusion' crusines are more than plenty in a metropolis like Madrid, but tranditional local food eateries are rare. In Casa Salvador we have found a pleasant experience in traditional flavor, and had every supper here during our stay. The dishes are simple, some may not even appear fascnating, but they are all genuine and nice. In Madrid, you have to try at least once, to eat like a local. About their service. It's not a Michelin with professional waiters. It's more like a little neigbourhood bistro, staffed all by family members. The waiter, a gentleman, acutally does not speak or understand much English, but he's very helpful and eager to offer what he can best provide. During our first visit he mistook a dish we ordered and said the other dish we ordered was sold out (in fact not, but, interestingly, the two substitute dishes were equally good). The lady in charge speaks good English, so during our next visit, we double-checked with her after fixing the order with the gentleman. The gentleman was still sorry about the mistake yesterday, and he was apparently very happy that we visited again. We enjoyed the suppers there, the mistakes are only an interesting part of experience of travelling in a foreign country and exploring new flavors. They provide half-size dishes, so you can try more varieties at one time. About the environment. Small room decorated with old bull-fighting photos.  In all, we love those people, and we wish more visitors can try their food. They are 3 mins walk away from the Chueca metro station, and 5 mins from the Cibeles Plaza.",2019-10-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2034008-Reviews-Restaurante_Casa_Salvador-Madrid.html,UID_37976,0.033,0.781,0.186,0.9952,0.2481165824915825,0.4656024531024531,0.3200235294117647,1604,129,0.0804239401496259,0,51,False,59,0.0895522388059701,0.1641791044776119,0.373134328358209,0.0597014925373134,0.2686567164179104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0298507462686567,0.0149253731343283,275,185,4.832727272727273,0,0,food modern fusion crusin plenti metropoli like madrid trandit local food eateri rare casa salvador found pleasant experi tradit flavor everi supper stay dish simpl may even appear fascnat genuin nice madrid tri least eat like local servic michelin profession waiter like littl neigbourhood bistro staf famili member waiter gentleman acut speak understand much english help eager offer best provid first visit mistook dish order said dish order sold fact interestingli two substitut dish equal good ladi charg speak good english next visit doubl check fix order gentleman gentleman still sorri mistak yesterday appar happi visit enjoy supper mistak interest part experi travel foreign countri explor new flavor provid half size dish tri varieti one time environ small room decor old bull fight photo love peopl wish visitor tri food min walk away chueca metro station min cibel plaza,average review,3

I usually do not contribute to reviews unless it is either exceptionally terrible or terrific. This review, unfortunately, is a terrible review. We ordered the foot-high seafood platter and an octopus dish when we visited this restaurant yesterday. The octopus itself was the softest octopus we have tasted in all of Spain (a huge plus); however, it was rather bland (for taste, you should definitely try it at the Mercado de San Miguel). As for the seafood platter, we were very disappointed. We started with a great deal of excitement, but felt the taste was not nearly as good as what other reviews had stated - tasted like frozen seafood. Looking around at other tables (the restaurant was fairly full) to see how much others are enjoying the same dish (because practically everyone ordered the same seafood platter - their signature dish), I came to notice two major differences (check our photos with those of others or on their website). First, while others had snow and dungeness crabs, we were served only one snow crab, and they filled the platter with snow crab legs rather than what should have been dungeness crab. Second, we were given two very small crabs (resembling blue crabs) while others were given what appeared to have been stone crabs (the ones with huge claws). I kept looking around, and we were the only one among dozens with such a difference. I asked to speak with someone who could speak English. A staff member arrived and was trying to explain with broken English which I could not understand. We left the place very disappointed. Staff was not helpful and very unapologetic - this was unfortunate which prompted me to share this review. Those who decide to venture after reading this review, I hope your experience is a positive one. For us, it left a sour taste in our mouth...a very unpleasant experience while in Madrid...and, hopefully, the only one.",2019-07-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1373174-Reviews-Marisqueria_Ribeira_do_Mino-Madrid.html,UID_37990,0.08,0.819,0.102,0.7784,-0.059070583887657,0.5398078344419809,0.5391941176470587,2023,164,0.0810677212061295,0,60,False,62,0.0804597701149425,0.1034482758620689,0.1954022988505747,0.057471264367816,0.1264367816091954,0.0689655172413793,0.1034482758620689,0.0344827586206896,0.1264367816091954,0.1034482758620689,349,210,4.799426934097421,0,0,univers professor us visit well countri lifetim adult also love explor food usual contribut review unless either except terribl terrif review unfortun terribl review order foot high seafood platter octopu dish visit restaur yesterday octopu softest octopu tast spain huge plu howev rather bland tast definit tri mercado de san miguel seafood platter disappoint start great deal excit felt tast nearli good review state tast like frozen seafood look around tabl restaur fairli full see much other enjoy dish practic everyon order seafood platter signatur dish came notic two major differ check photo other websit first other snow dung crab serv one snow crab fill platter snow crab leg rather dung crab second given two small crab resembl blue crab other given appear stone crab one huge claw kept look around one among dozen differ ask speak someon could speak english staff member arriv tri explain broken english could understand left place disappoint staff help unapologet unfortun prompt share review decid ventur read review hope experi posit one us left sour tast mouth unpleas experi madrid hope one,bad review,2

The staff is very nice and attentive. I decided to try the 20 euro Tapas Menu to get a good sampling of the restaurant's dishes, and while all in all it was a good experience, the dishes were uneven. The most pedestrian and almost tasteless offering was the first: sliced portobello mushrooms marinated with truffle oil and served with Parmesan cheese and pine nuts. But again, that was the first dish, and they seemed to get better from there. Especially wonderful are the Patatas Bravas a la ""Arola"", which are really nicely spiced and are more like twice baked stuff potatoes. It was unique to be served a number of chicken wings, but these just didn't deliver much compared to American spicy ""Buffalo-style wings."" The dark chocolate fondue with fresh cut fruit was delicious. The decor is tasteful and modern though the soundtrack with Portishead/Morcheeba type music is beginning to feel redundant: it seems such hipster music has become standard at modern Bistros like this.

We arrived early at 8pm without a reservation (you definitely need one in season or on weekends). The friendly and elegant proprietress graciously offered us a two top in the main dining room with the condition that we vacate by 10pm. This was fine with us since we’d been traveling for 36 hours and planned to turn in early. (I observed her accommodate many tourists and locals alike with the same friendly smile.) We started our meal with a couple of house gin and tonics, which arrived in fishbowl sized glasses elegantly garnished with basil leaves. Delicious and refreshing, even in November. We chose the traditional 22 Euro tapas menu over the 36 Euro seafood menu because we had enjoyed seafood for lunch. Out came the first course- chilled mushroom carpaccio with parmesan and white truffle oil generously drizzled over the top. This first dish really summed up what this place is all about- transforming honest, local ingredients into unexpected delights. At this point, we ordered a bottle of Rioja, which at 29 Euros was a solid complement to our budget friendly meal. The second course of burrata, shredded red cabbage, and beets was equally creative yet satisfying. The creamy texture of the burrata paired perfectly with the salty, soy marinated beets. Next, we enjoyed juicy and rich meatballs with Vi Cool’s signature version of traditional patatas bravas, elegantly presented as a rolled canape topped with a petite dollop of creamy aioli. Even in this elevated form, the potatoes were crispy on the outside and deliciously creamy inside. Though we were already full at this point, there was yet another tapas to enjoy- chicken drumettes, lightly fried and topped with sliced scallions. Dessert arrived in a pair of shot glasses. The waiter explained that the dish was best enjoyed in proper order. First, the pineapple rosemary pudding/cream (my favorite) followed by the dulce de leche. Both were amazing. In summary, the quality of the food was excellent and the service prompt and friendly. The value was exceptional. I would definitely recommend this tapas restaurant to anyone staying in central Madrid, or visiting the Museo del Prado, as the restaurant is an easy 10-minute walk (up Calle de Huertas) from the museum.",2017-11-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2475639-Reviews-or60-Vi_Cool-Madrid.html,UID_38001,0.0,0.768,0.232,0.9986,0.3204802259887006,0.5524011299435028,0.2997590909090908,2444,160,0.0654664484451718,0,55,False,85,0.1235955056179775,0.1685393258426966,0.3370786516853932,0.0449438202247191,0.2022471910112359,0.0224719101123595,0.0112359550561797,0.0449438202247191,0.0224719101123595,0.0224719101123595,404,264,5.051980198019802,0,0,dine world includ numer michelin star restaur place could enjoy six cours tast menu qualiti creativ euro person arriv earli pm without reserv definit need one season weekend friendli eleg proprietress gracious offer us two top main dine room condit vacat pm fine us sinc travel hour plan turn earli observ accommod mani tourist local alik friendli smile start meal coupl hous gin tonic arriv fishbowl size glass elegantli garnish basil leav delici refresh even novemb chose tradit euro tapa menu euro seafood menu enjoy seafood lunch came first cours chill mushroom carpaccio parmesan white truffl oil gener drizzl top first dish realli sum place transform honest local ingredi unexpect delight point order bottl rioja euro solid complement budget friendli meal second cours burrata shred red cabbag beet equal creativ yet satisfi creami textur burrata pair perfectli salti soy marin beet next enjoy juici rich meatbal vi cool signatur version tradit patata brava elegantli present roll canap top petit dollop creami aioli even elev form potato crispi outsid delici creami insid though alreadi full point yet anoth tapa enjoy chicken drumett lightli fri top slice scallion dessert arriv pair shot glass waiter explain dish best enjoy proper order first pineappl rosemari pud cream favorit follow dulc de lech amaz summari qualiti food excel servic prompt friendli valu except would definit recommend tapa restaur anyon stay central madrid visit museo del prado restaur easi minut walk call de huerta museum,very good review,5

But you come here for the food - fresh fish and seafood cooked Galician style, with plenty of rich olive oil, firm potatoes and lots of the typically Spanish paprika known as pimenton. In our case, we let our waiter do the picking, asking for a selection of typical Galician dishes to share with tourists that know nothing about that part of northern Spain. And we were in for a treat: empanadas gallegas to start off, followed by mussels in a creamy sauce, pulpo a la gallega (the signature dish), merluza a la gallega, bacalao al horno, lubina a la espalda ... All washed down by a very pleasant (and reasonably priced) Albarino white wine.

We were a bit sceptic at first, as the prices seemed relatively high from the display outside the door, but when we came in and were seated, they had both a la carte and menus at reasonable prices. We were asked if it was okay to sit in the basement and were offered to check it out before deciding. We decided it was okay, so we were seated there. We started off with a Mojito, which was not quite to my taste with pineapple, but was nicely made. We ordered 3 orders of the classic tapas menu (three people there), which was incredible! It is not much like traditional small tapas dishes, but a modern interpretation of the traditional tastes. Very delicious, and a perfect amount of food. The menu, when we were there, consisted of three cold dishes, three warm dishes and a dessert for €22, which was very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food. The drinks were a bit more expensive than what we had otherwise had in Madrid, but still not outrageous.

Was recommended it by a couple of locals.  First, get there EARLY. As you will know most Spaniards eat around 9pm but if you don't want to wait in a queue and get a good seat come at around 8 or 8.30 before it actually opens.  It is great if you want to have some tapas and wine but don't plan on staying to long as the large crowds gathering, the noise, and the pushing will shortly irriate you. So would not recommend for a romantic meal. However the food is great, brilliantly prepared un front of you using unusual techniques but the taste is definitely there. They have brilliant wines too.

I arrived feeling tired and just wanted to eat something quick and go to bed however on entering sala abd deciding to eat there i immedietly came to life. The place has a real buzz to it and its fun and interesting to watch the food being prepared in front of you. The chefs are polite and freindly as is the waiter and we were recommended good wines and some excellent tapas. We had the octopus which we thoughly enjoyed and a sushi dish and the tuna which was just delicious. I could of orderd lots more as everything i saw caught my eye and i wanted it. I was lucky to find a seat even if it was a bit cramped and my partner eventualy got a seat. If this is midweek then weekends must be unbeliviably busy.

It's very good and very creative that it's worth visiting. This restaurant also does great fusion tapas, which is not very common as most fusion tapas we discovered were not quite there yet. We also like the wine list as they offer very interesting choices. So as food enthusiast, we have returned every now and then when we are looking for a light meal.  Now for warnings: This is a place for young crowd in search of rare interesting food and drinks in chic atmosphere. It is not a place for elderly tourist who seek a hearty big course meal with comfortable seating.  Also as stated earlier, service in this place is aloof at best, bored and distant at worst. However, considering the fame of the star chef, it is not a surprise. Most restaurants in Spain with superstar chefs, with only a few as exceptions, are somewhat guarantee to give you standoffish service in varying degrees. The bill is not coming cheap either which is again normal to a restaurant of this fame.  So the verdict is If you are on a budget, want some comfort and TLC with a belly filling meal then this is not for you. However if you are the ""I will go anywhere, try anything once"" for food that delights your palate then go ahead you won't be disappointed.",2012-11-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2475639-Reviews-or230-Vi_Cool-Madrid.html,UID_373,0.038,0.76,0.203,0.9909,0.2135576923076923,0.6006089743589744,0.2463583333333333,1252,120,0.0958466453674121,0,29,False,39,0.1129032258064516,0.1774193548387097,0.3548387096774194,0.064516129032258,0.1612903225806451,0.0161290322580645,0.0161290322580645,0.032258064516129,0.0483870967741935,0.0161290322580645,229,147,4.458515283842795,0,0,like food good creativ worth visit restaur also great fusion tapa common fusion tapa discov quit yet also like wine list offer interest choic food enthusiast return everi look light meal warn place young crowd search rare interest food drink chic atmospher place elderli tourist seek hearti big cours meal comfort seat also state earlier servic place aloof best bore distant worst howev consid fame star chef surpris restaur spain superstar chef except somewhat guarante give standoffish servic vari degre bill come cheap either normal restaur fame verdict budget want comfort tlc belli fill meal howev go anywher tri anyth food delight palat go ahead disappoint,good review,4

On my recent trip I couldn’t find it, went around the neighborhood searching and was finally directed to its new location several blocks away. I arrived at the door and asked if it would be possible to have lunch that day and received a very lukewarm response. The restaurant was virtually empty and I was received by the haughtiest maitre d‘ this side of a Hollywood casting studio and was shown to the worst table in the dining room. Menu appeared and there was the dish I had been longing for since I arrived: 'Pulpo a la Gallega'. I ordered it along with Caldo Gallego and a half bottle of Ribiero and sat back ignoring the fact that though several staff were standing around watching none of them would glance my way or approach the table. The Maitre d‘ glared at my table whenever he passed through to the kitchen, but no water glass was refilled nor was my wine poured for me... once the food arrived I was left to it. The Caldo was not anything special, however the pulpo was--it was amazing, and I cleaned a large plate filled with it and could probably have eaten more. As I ate tables began to fill, and the staff and Maitre d’ became increasingly more nervous at my presence. I on the other hand was enjoying myself, and the situation, and I stretched my wine out as long as I reasonably could. Ordered flan for dessert, it was only so-so but it allowed me to sit at the table a bit longer. By the time I was finished the restaurant was largely filled and I was fascinated to see the clientele... 25 years ago one mostly saw a mix of working-class, middle-class and tourists eating at the Gallega, but now it was filled with elegant Madrileños, seemed almost like a private club. I could understand why the management was so impatient for me to leave, and I would have felt a little sympathy if they hadn’t been so bloody rude. My bill came to a little under $100 and I did not begrudge paying this as I had had both great pulpo and a most entertaining afternoon.",2012-12-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697476-Reviews-or190-Casa_Gallega-Madrid.html,UID_38044,0.07,0.835,0.094,0.9494,0.1410281385281385,0.569280303030303,0.8117461538461537,2149,199,0.0926012098650535,0,44,False,68,0.173076923076923,0.1346153846153846,0.25,0.0576923076923076,0.1346153846153846,0.0192307692307692,0.0384615384615384,0.0384615384615384,0.0769230769230769,0.0769230769230769,399,234,4.388471177944862,0,0,year ago whenev madrid love lunch genuin galician restaur tuck away shadow plaza mayor favorit citi recent trip find went around neighborhood search final direct new locat sever block away arriv door ask would possibl lunch day receiv lukewarm respons restaur virtual empti receiv haughtiest maitr side hollywood cast studio shown worst tabl dine room menu appear dish long sinc arriv pulpo la gallega order along caldo gallego half bottl ribiero sat back ignor fact though sever staff stand around watch none would glanc way approach tabl maitr glare tabl whenev pass kitchen water glass refil wine pour food arriv left caldo anyth special howev pulpo amaz clean larg plate fill could probabl eaten ate tabl began fill staff maitr becam increasingli nervou presenc hand enjoy situat stretch wine long reason could order flan dessert allow sit tabl bit longer time finish restaur larg fill fascin see clientel year ago one mostli saw mix work class middl class tourist eat gallega fill eleg madril os seem almost like privat club could understand manag impati leav would felt littl sympathi bloodi rude bill came littl begrudg pay great pulpo entertain afternoon,average review,3

As a general rule, I would advise that any bar or restaurant which requires publicity via the use of promoters to 'lure you in' (O'Reilleys being an example) should be avoided, as these are the poorer quality restaurants. This restaurant, alongside several others located on the same road do not need promoters or cheap deals, simply because they are good quality restaurants with high standards of food and service. Hence, I would recommend spending that extra 5-10 euros per person to ensure great food and top service.  The portions of tapas here were very large relative to other restaurants, hence offering good value for money; our waiter was so sincere, he had advised us when were over-ordering as we were unaware of portion sizes at time time, and he was spot on about how much food we would need!. He also gave us free olives and not one or two, but THREE portions of free bread to complement our delicious food; the most pleasant was the vegetarian soup with egg mixed with the fresh bread they gave us. In terms of drinks, I ordered a sangria for little over two euros which was absolutely divine, and a few of the others ordered a beer which they seemed content with.  Overall, the bill came to 44 Euros between 4 people including 1-2 alcoholic drinks each, fantastic service and great food.

Saw the daily special written on the entrance for Paella mixta for 6.50 Euros....that's a deal. We went inside as all the outside tables were taken...probably a good idea as it rained about 20 minutes later. We had a lovely waiteress that spoke english...We placed our order for 2 of the paella's one mixta and one with meat only as my wife is allergic to shell fish...After we ordered the waitress came back to inquire about the allergy, saying that the water they used for the rice was the same they used to cook the seafood and if there was an allergy, they would use plain water to cook the rice. We ordered a bottle of white wine....the house wine.. it was VERY good for 8.50 euros....along with the wine came a dish of green olives... The waitress told us that there was a 20 minute wait for paella....which was ok with us. When the food came it was served in individual paella dishes. The food was darned good. The mixta had a good amount of seafood, clams, mussels, shrip, and calamare. The other had plenty of chicken along with veggies.  After the entry we ordered Flan for desert...

We ate here a couple times because of the friendly wait staff, its good location that was off of the busy streets (no cars), and the reasonably priced and varied tapas. The second time we ate there we had a delicious paella, served as a tapa but large enough to feed two (more like a racione), freshly made for that serving (as opposed to being scooped out of a big pan made earlier) that included fresh prawns, shrimp, and other seafood, all for only 6 euros. Together with one other tapa, it made dinner. The clientele was a blend of tourists and locals. We always know we've found a good place to eat when we see locals there. As a side note that detracted from the experience, we ate outside both times and there was a steady stream of people coming by begging for money from all of the customers at the outside tables of all the restaurants, along with others selling flowers or other junk.

The restaurant has two main sections, a bar where drinks and tapas can be purchased and a formal dining area. We decided on a formal meal and can't comment on the tapas section. The meal we had was excellent. For starters, my wife had a mixed salad with tuna (Salad Nicoise) and I had a clear consume soup with a hint of mint. Both were delicious. For the main course, she had Arroz de Marisco with clams, squid, mussels, and shrimp while I had Merluza con Almejas (Hake with clams cooked in a garlic broth). Again, both were delicious. The hake had a delicate flavor. Finally, for desert, we shared a Panchineta de Fresa which was a very delicate pastry surrounded by sauteed strawberries. With a glass of wine, two bottles of water, herbal tea and an expresso, the bill came to 54 euros. The restaurant has a wonderful formality to it. The decor is modernistic (black, white and silver) as are many newer European restaurants but with delightful photographs of Madrid buildings on the wall and a wall-size photo of New York's skyline. The atmosphere is quiet and private as the different tables are separated into sections. The meal was of high quality.

But in any event this is both a fun place, and somewhere to get some delicious food. Not much point in it if octopus is not you idea of a tasty dish, but if it is, you cannot fail to enjoy it. Octopus served in every possible way, even in croquettas. You can watch the beasties being snipped into bite sized pieces in a window onto the street . Plenty of excellent and cheap wines to wash it down. Salads and soups too if you wish, and the desserts are also more tempting than in many a Madrid establishment.

Located just few minutes walking from Puerta del Sol. We were enjoying our experience (apart some trouble to communicate with few member of staff who only speaks spanish), with some nice beer, very good green peppers ,calamari and spanish chorizo. Our trouble start when the steak arrived, which were expecting it grilled and medium rare, and it came fried and rare. So with the communication trouble we ask it to have it grilled, but instead came back after 2 minutes the same steak which was most likely just microwaved (and became well done in the meantime). So we told them again that we don't want the steak in this conditions , and after few minutes the waitress told us that the chef was asking if we can choose something different from the menu !!!

I made my a reservation for 9.30 and we were greatly warmly on arrival, with the restaurant still pretty quiet.  Our waiter showed us to a table in the front of the restaurant, but promptly picked up on my husband's mobility issues and offered us a table in the back with a more solid dining chair, which was much appreciated.  We ordered a selection of dishes from their new menu, including two types of croquette, scrambled eggs with jam on and black truffle, octopus with potato foam and red curry and oxtail cannelloni. The dishes were a joy, and we thoroughly enjoyed every one, though the stand out for me was the octopus dish which was quite simply the best I've ever eaten. The ham, eggs and truffle ran it a very close second.  We enjoyed 3 beers and a glass of Rioja, along with bread and olives with our dinner, and were very pleasantly surprised at the bill, which came to €50.  We loved our evening at Desengano 13; the service was warm, friendly and attentive and our waiter was happy to discuss the dishes and wine list with us.

We looked online for places to eat near Gran Via and came across Desengano 13. Only a couple of blocks off of Gran Via and what a great place. We went there around 6pm just before our 8pm Flamenco show (Cafe de Chinitas - review to follow). We were the only ones there during that time. The staff was great. Had 4 glasses of wine, an appetizer, one side, 2 entrees and one dessert for around 70 Euros. Had the mozzarella appetizer and mushroom side. Both were very tasty. My fiancée had the oxtail and I had the ribs (pics below). Both were delicious but the oxtail had a better presentation and unique taste. The house red was awesome (pic below).
