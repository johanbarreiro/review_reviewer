This was to be our first experience with tapas and we were truly spoiled right out of the gate. First off, don’t expect a small plate of olives, some cured meat and a little cheese, this place is full on creative genius. My favorite plate by far was roasted eggplant wrapped in bacon with tomato orange sauce. It wasn’t bacon, it was just the right amount of some kind of yummy specialty ham draped on the big chunks of succulent eggplant and the sauce on it was a-mazing! All the tapas were as interesting and yummy and you will be sorry you can’t eat more. Make a reservation, chances are pretty good you’ll need it. Service is friendly, helpful and responsive.

The food was tasty, no complaints, but we were in and out within an hour. The place has a funky vibe that reminded me of a college hangout, not a good restaurant. The service, although indeed friendly, was overbearing. We were asked 3 times within the first 5 minutes if we were ready to order food yet. Every other patron appeared to be under the age of 35 (we are in our early 60's). A few tables had young children, and many appeared to be college students.

However, our third visit was the best as we have learnt how to manage the experience and not be rushed through our food and drinks in double quick time.

During our trip to Madrid, we visited this place twice since the combination of food- money- service- ambiance were just great ! Although we did not have any reservation ( it is better to book a table in advance), the extremely polite and very professional waiter - Lucas - was there for us to find a table and recommend us the best dishes of the restaurant. Actually ALL the dishes are great but the highlight for me are the ' Presa de cerdo Iberic ' , one of the best jamon iberico I have ever tried. Also, the potatoes ( from starters) with the 3 different sauces are extremely delicious. The hamburger -a surprise since it does not have the traditional bread but it consists of 2 beefs and potatoes - is one of the highlights of the Metro Bistro as well as the dish with the pork. We had also a great red wine, the 'Habla del Silencio '. Another surprise the bread- try the dark one with orange and chocolate ! In one word : you have to visit the place more than one time !  p.s.

The service was brilliant from start to finish, we were a little pushed for time so our waiter had our plates brought out as soon as possible. We were treated to two tasting samples of the house special mojito. While it was very good they also had several other cocktails which we ended up getting. The croquettes were probably the best that I have ever had. I had one of the nicest eggs that I ever had and unfortunately, I am still not entirely sure how it was cooked (something similar to poaching but the result being a softer egg without the quaggy texture). This egg was served on a combination of mushroom types with a sauce that complimented the dish while not taking away from the flavour. I then had some guinea fowl which was cooked to perfection on top of eggplant with a mouth-watering coconut sauce. It was probably in my top 5 dining experiences despite having to cut this experience short to make a flamenco show on time.

Be prepared to wait quite a while to receive your food and drinks from the time that you order them. They even forgot one of your meals, so we ended up sharing everything. The food has the inspiration to be amazing, but falls short with average taste. The appearance of the food looks amazing, but I judge on actual taste. This is no where near the top restaurants on Madrid and can only determine it's high ranking by it's mere presence on TripAdvisor. Also, the drinks are unleaded. We ordered a Sangria to start and didn't even have a buzz. Then a Caipirinha, which was a bit more leaded, but no a real drink. So we ended with a white wine that was OK. Overall, I give the experience a 5 and think this is the most overrated restaurant I've been too. Plus is was dirty and dingy inside.

Having went to the nearby Royal Palace to look around we returned to El miniBar for afternoon snack. Service was average and I was initially put off by the waitress who appeared to be working hard but stopped to have a cigarette break by the entrance. Not really what you want to see prior to bringing your food out. A number of dishes on the menu looked appealing but was told that some 10 dishes or so we're sold out due to a busy weekend. This just seemed like poor restaurant preparation given that it is number 2 on trip advisor and you expect an influx of customers. The toasted onion and goats cheese that we had was good though.

Additionally we were served the main cource at different times, still without anything to eat it with. Moving on to the wine serving - served in dirty glasses. Only positive thing here is that we got new glasses and a new bottle of wine. Worth a point in the rating.

The empanadas were really basic for the most part and nothing so outstanding as is being portrayed on this site. They are good and definitely better than a typical empanada one would have, but I have certainly had better ones with more flavor and spice before. To consider it as one of the top ten places to eat in Madrid (as is shown on here) is a misrepresentation, in my opinion. If you are in a hurry and want a good, fast, and inexpensive meal, then I would definitely recommend to come here. One thing I'll say is that the service I received was excellent which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 3.

A three course set menu was promised. We went for a 30 euro tapas selection which included sangria as the menu was the day menu (we went at 8pm and it was still out). Never got free drinks. Sangria was good but came in a high narrow carafe, which was very difficult to pour and I made a mess. The napkins we used to mop the spill up were left in our table the entire time and we didn't get any new ones. The tapas arrived one by one, the last one with a break of a good 10 minutes.

Great food and very good service from the waiters as well. Not very expensive as well. The shared paella is more than enough for two people. Great athmosphere and pretty colorful decoration helps having a good diner. Strongly recommend, but if you would like to sit straight away, make yourselves a favour and make a reservation.

Colorful, cool and funky place and, yes, at Rosi La Loca know very well their job! We popped it without a reservation but despite the fact it was full full, we got a table at the basement. Staff is as cool as the decor and ambience of the place, very helpful with the menu and very friendly with everybody. We ordered paella with chicken and seafood and we had been informed it needs some extra time to be ready (was also noted on the menu) and we were patient because we wanted so much to have a real Spanish paella. In the meantime, while waiting we had been offered complimentary, yummy potatoes with a sauce. And yes, it was worth waiting because paella was amazingly good. We ate everything and it was a big pan! From what we saw passing in front of our eyes, served on other tables the rest of the dishes looked so delicious and I'm sure they really were, otherwise there wouldn't be so many people (even locals) for lunch already in the early afternoon!

We ordered 4 tapas dishes through the recommendations of the waitress (menu not English) and Sangria which cost us €32. Staff were really helpful in both helping us choose off the menu and when we enquired about general things to do in Madrid. It was busy but I felt we got as much service as we would have wanted without being hassled or feeling like we'd been forgotten. I don't know the name of the waitress but she provided this service and even told us about where to go out and get souvenirs.  4 tapas dishes were too much for us! The waitress did enquire thinking we didn't like the food but it was literally too much for us to eat. But i thought it was nice to ask as I've had experiences where I've left a plate of food because it wasn't nice and the waiters have not cared. I therefore thought service deserved a good rating as she was really attentive.  The restaurant is quite small (see photos) but this didn't bother us. This dining was better than the one we had in La Latina the previous evening which cost us double and it had a nice albeit busy atmosphere. Food was not 5* but we didn't want anything fancy. Would recommend if you are okay with small and cheerful but not if you want a fine dining experience. ,2015-05-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7204621-Reviews-or1730-Rosi_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_4083,0.048,0.813,0.138,0.9787,0.25625,0.4631944444444445,0.3284384615384615,1341,125,0.093214019388516,1,27,False,77,0.0925925925925925,0.1481481481481481,0.2407407407407407,0.074074074074074,0.1666666666666666,0.037037037037037,0.0185185185185185,0.0555555555555555,0.1111111111111111,0.0555555555555555,249,151,4.377510040160643,0,0,visit find trip advisor want somewher authent overli price order tapa dish recommend waitress menu english sangria cost us staff realli help help us choos menu enquir gener thing madrid busi felt got much servic would want without hassl feel like forgotten know name waitress provid servic even told us go get souvenir tapa dish much us waitress enquir think like food liter much us eat thought nice ask experi left plate food nice waiter care therefor thought servic deserv good rate realli attent restaur quit small see photo bother us dine better one la latina previou even cost us doubl nice albeit busi atmospher food want anyth fanci would recommend okay small cheer want fine dine experi,average review,3

So we sat down there.  The table was quickly cleared but when I asked for the children's menu (and yes I did speak in Spanish) all I was given was the adults 'menu del dia' and was told that there wasn't a separate children's menu. By this time our children were very hungry and didn't want to trapse upstairs and hunt for somewhere else to eat so we shared 2 menus between the 4 of us. The children ate the pasta starter which they said was nice. The Oxtail my husband had was fatty and cold (a lump of bone on the plate) and there were no potatoes (as stated it came with on the menu), My small piece beef was like a piece of gristle on the plate and was not nice either.

Its located just off Plaza Mayor which is a prominent tourist destination so its quite easy to find!  We were treated to a welcoming cocktail type shot to begin with which I think was a mojitio style with celery. Very nice I must say!  We tried the 7 degustation menu and had cocktails to drink. We had been to a cocktail bar previously so decided to stick with them instead of wine.  The meal was excellent, course after course came at an even tempo while it was quick we never felt rushed! It was perfect! The service was excellent and we addressed in English by all the waiter which helped. Some had better English than others but I can't complain after all I am a visiter in their country.  Overall service and food was excellent and the highlight was the chocolate dessert medley, amazing!!! Price was reasonable too for a degustation menu, €38pp and cocktails for around €90.

We went to dinner a little earlier than expected, maybe 7pm, and had the place to ourselves.  The location is nice right along Gran Via. Inside, the restaurant has a great look to it and the staff was quick to have us seated and taken care of. English and Spanish menu options.  First of all, drinks are amazing. We sat near the bar so we got to watch our waiter make each one. Order sangria (comes in a little mason jar) and 2 mojitos- strawberry and mango (comes in flower pot). We could've drank 3 rounds of these.  The menu has a great selection, sticks true to its Italian/pizzeria feel. Our waiter was helpful to answer questions and give recommendations. We got a variety of pizza, mozzarella, and pastas. All spectacular. You could really tell they take time with each dish and use the stone oven!  We had to end the nice with dessert; cheesecake and oven baked cookie skillet. WOW. we may go back just for these, we were stuffed from the great meal but we definitely made room for this.  What really finished it perfectly was when our waiter brought us each a shot of an aperitif on the house (can't remember the name of it, but some kind of cinnamon-y milk-alcohol mixture).

The hostess proceeded to find a way to accommodate us amongst the 4 tables of guests in the vast expanse of their restaurant. We sat for 20 minutes without even being asked about drinks or food. Meanwhile a family of 4 were seated next to us. They ordered and received drinks, bread, a pizza for their children and a salad. Yes we could have yelled a the waitress to take our order while she waited in that family, but that isn’t how service works. We got up and left. Reality is their is a pizza place called Hot Now just a 5 minute walk away that will accommodate you with a smile. You get to sit alone or at a communal table, which is nice to interact with locals. This place was nearly full and they had no issue putting us at the communal table. The guacamole was excellent and the pizza was amazing for less money than this pretentious place. Don’t waste your time here wander 5 minutes into the side streets and get better food for your money. They got one star because I can’t give zero. But this is clearly zero star.

As soon as they brought new one we also got our souce for burgers. The quality of burgers was ok and as I wrote in a title nothing special. I think next time we go somewhere else and not to that place. It is not because of the hair but just the food was not awesome. As a complimentary and ""sorry"" we got a desert for free.

The ribs for main were also cold and came only with some potato wedges. It was then we decided to skip the dessert (even though it was included in the €10 menu).

I stuck with it because of the good reviews and we were all very glad we did. We saw other people with blankets and so asked for some for us, and then the drinks arrived which were all generously served and helped to warm us up. When the food came, its quality and originality took us all by surprise. We had the tapas Breton, some chicken cigarillos and wild boar crepes which were all delicious and very different from your standard tourist tapas fare. We ordered some more drinks afterwards and were well on our way to a merry night by then. We were brought plenty of free nibbles and a farewell shooter each, which amused my parents. The measures are ridiculously generous and they seem to specialize in gin and tonic which really hit the spot.

First of all, it costs about 1 euro more (per tapa) to eat outside than inside. I guess this happens elsewhere and is not unique to this restaurant, but in my opinion its a bad sign. If you order several things it can easily increase your bill significantly.  The service is very slow. One of the owners (i think) was friendly and helped explain some of the menu items so we ordered their ""famous"" tapa which basically amounts to melted cheese on a plate with some sauces that you eat with bread. The flavors when it all came together was okay, but the bread was old and stale. Supposedly this won some kind of tapa award. I am doubtful of that. Second we ordered what was supposed to be a croquette sampler with a variety of flavors. All 8 croquettes were seafood, no variety there. Had some drinks which were nothing special. Would not go back",2014-10-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3688138-Reviews-or660-El_miniBAR-Madrid.html,UID_4284,0.079,0.802,0.119,0.8683,0.0218988095238095,0.5412380952380953,0.5573076923076924,934,82,0.0877944325481798,0,23,False,39,0.0571428571428571,0.1142857142857142,0.2857142857142857,0.1142857142857142,0.1142857142857142,0.0571428571428571,0.0571428571428571,0.0285714285714285,0.1142857142857142,0.0571428571428571,170,126,4.494117647058824,0,0,went find restaur base trip advisor review came away disappoint first cost euro per tapa eat outsid insid guess happen elsewher uniqu restaur opinion bad sign order sever thing easili increas bill significantli servic slow one owner think friendli help explain menu item order famou tapa basic amount melt chees plate sauc eat bread flavor came togeth okay bread old stale supposedli kind tapa award doubt second order suppos croquett sampler varieti flavor croquett seafood varieti drink noth special would go back,bad review,2

My partner had the scrambled egg toast with eels and was reasonably happy with her meal, no complaints. I ordered the 'Iberico chunk', which turned out to be like a pork stir fry and looked very nice. There were seven or eight pieces of pork accompanied by vegetables.  Unfortunately, three of the pieces were not cooked. I had to spit some out, which was not very pleasant. I brought this to the waitress' attention when she collected the plates. I did not receive an apology, just 'Do you want more?'. I declined. When I went inside to pay, I explained that I did not feel I should pay full price for this particular dish but had no issue paying for everything else.

A great discovery as otherwise I might have ignored it, it's quite understated from the outside during the day.

The tapas is excellent if from a relatively limited menu, and the overall experience is top notch. We went several times over our trip to Madrid and it was unfailingly brilliant each time.

It is directly opposite the Tryp Ambassador hotel which is where we were staying. As others have said it doesn't look a lot, in fact I hadn't noticed it while coming into and out the hotel. Once sat down, the staff were great - not much English spoken so we went with our limited Spanish and the English descriptions on the menu and it worked out fine. The Tapas we had was excellent - their award winning cheese special was great. We arrived early (7:30pm) and had to wait until 8:00pm (they looked closed on Sunday) for the food to start but had an excellent looking Gin & Tonic while we waited. The place was full when we left with a mixture of locals and visitors creating a lively atmosphere.

We went to Bodin the following night and instead of staying for coffee and dessert we returned to Metro Bistro and they were more than happy to let us just have coffee and some of their gorgeous chocolates.

I went to this restaurant a few days earlier to make sure if this restaurant was suitable for the business dinner. A staff member confirmed my booking and told to reserve a big table nearby the window. On that dinner date, I was waiting at the reception to be served. However, a group of (stupid) people cut in the line and surprisingly took the window table! I spoke to the staff member whom I spoke to the other day but she said the table was occupied and they were preparing another table. The table was in the noisiest part of restaurant, we felt quite uncomfortable. The food was average at best, we had four more business dinners during the show, this was the worst in every way. When checking out, we were told that the credit card reader was not working and there was an ATM over there. I refused to fetch money (also cashing incurs an interest and a cashing fee), then the staff said ""This is not working, OK you can stay here all the night!"". What a rude person! This was not our fault at all, how dare could she behave like that? A couple of more customers were also told like this and got frustrated.

We had tapa Breton and canutillos filled with boar. Just excellent, in every way. The tapa Breton was one of the best dishes I had in Spain. Complex in flavor and yet simple to enjoy.

The food was amazing - really delicious, well prepared and the portions were good size. It was a bargain for this price.

Arrived about 9-15 & hardly anyone inside which made us wonder about going in. Would have been a big mistake if we had not, especially as it started to fill up after we were seated. The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated which immediately gives you a good feel about it. From start to finish the food was delightfully imaginative, inventive & just delicious, even the bread & the butter at the start. The table next to us were having the 7 course taster menu which we would love to have had but it would have been too much.

But although it was an acceptable hour for early dining in Spain, we almost gave it a miss because it was so empty. However the reviews won the day and we decided to give it a try in the expectation that it would fill up a bit later.  The seven course Taster Menu looked to be good value and we chose that, although a bit surprised to find that it was, as we later read on their web site, “a tour of their kitchen” or more correctly a tour of their menu rather than the bespoke set of dishes that we have become used to elsewhere. Overall it was a pleasing tour with some stops being better than others. The scallop on a black rice bed was excellent but the escalivada was trying too hard; the sea anemones with seaweed was interesting and the finale tribute to chocolate was sublime. It may sound a strange complaint, but because the courses were dishes from the menu they were on the large size for seven courses. However the service was excellent and the waitress and kitchen responded well to our request to slow down the delivery a bit towards the end. We would not go so far as some other reviewers to say “the best in Madrid” but it was very good value and an enjoyable meal. Pity about the empty tables that did not fill up as anticipated.",2015-09-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6498928-Reviews-or310-Metro_Bistro_Plaza_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_4352,0.057,0.751,0.192,0.9941,0.21418035030104,0.4776135741652983,0.6166555555555555,1413,142,0.1004953998584571,0,16,False,43,0.1388888888888889,0.1388888888888889,0.3055555555555556,0.0833333333333333,0.2222222222222222,0.0277777777777777,0.0,0.0,0.0555555555555555,0.0277777777777777,270,159,4.233333333333333,0,0,attract metro bistro strong pattern review perhap littl fact quit close hotel call atocha although accept hour earli dine spain almost gave miss empti howev review day decid give tri expect would fill bit later seven cours taster menu look good valu chose although bit surpris find later read web site tour kitchen correctli tour menu rather bespok set dish becom use elsewher overal pleas tour stop better other scallop black rice bed excel escalivada tri hard sea anemon seawe interest final tribut chocol sublim may sound strang complaint cours dish menu larg size seven cours howev servic excel waitress kitchen respond well request slow deliveri bit toward end would go far review say best madrid good valu enjoy meal piti empti tabl fill anticip,very good review,5

Everything from the service to the food, and the unique way everything was presented, was just out of this world. Every dish was really wonderful. On many recommendations, we tried the sea treasures (anemones), which you don't see often on menus. It's a must try. The steak tartare was perfectly prepared with incredible flavor combinations. We had a lot of croquettes on our vacation, and these were by far the best. If you're a chocolate fan like we are, the tribute to chocolate is outstanding, and the perfect way to wrap up the meal.

Her name is DANAE, she is pretty but has no customer service skills indeed we have booked a table for 3 peoples on December 1, 2019, very disappointed by the reception of this person so unpleasant and especially who does not know how to manage her stress and the contact with customers I am more than 7 months pregnant and we kindly asked her to let me wait inside knowing that my friends were ready to patiently wait outside she refused categorically while it was raining heavily and I did not feel well and was a bit scared to get sick  Then when she finally decided to give us a table while there were several free tables downstairs, she gives us a high talble with high chair which is very uncomfortable for a woman pregnant more than 7 months. We asked her to give us another table because it is uncomfortable for a pregnant woman she refused without even trying to find a solution to try to satisfy customers what is part of his work. We are still staying because I was too tired to find another restaurant but also because we had booked and if we cancel we must pay fees which is not normal especially with the host received by DANAE Luckily the meal was a total success the cook is wonderful the food is delicious and I recommend it to everyone it is worth it to go there please believe me the place is beautiful and the food so tasty. Especially the treatment of 3 waiters who did everything to make us forget the bad experience lived with DANAE, a french waiter Kevin very nice who made us magic tricks and was really attentive to us. Yola who advised us most of the dishes we loved all the dishes advised and finally Sebas who was very attentive too and give us some shots and one without alcohol for me as he knew I was pregnant. We thank very much these 3 waiters because thanks to them we will surely come back hoping to find another manager who will have a little more respect for customers who come to spend money because the Menu is far from low prices.",2019-12-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7204621-Reviews-or110-Rosi_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_3598,0.122,0.698,0.18,0.9876,0.1744523809523809,0.6629278499278499,1.0236666666666665,2104,200,0.0950570342205323,0,13,False,93,0.0862068965517241,0.1206896551724138,0.2327586206896551,0.0344827586206896,0.146551724137931,0.043103448275862,0.0775862068965517,0.0258620689655172,0.1551724137931034,0.0775862068965517,395,213,4.326582278481013,0,0,real shame nice restaur delici food eat disgrac disrespect manag name dana pretti custom servic skill inde book tabl peopl decemb disappoint recept person unpleas especi know manag stress contact custom month pregnant kindli ask let wait insid know friend readi patient wait outsid refus categor rain heavili feel well bit scare get sick final decid give us tabl sever free tabl downstair give us high talbl high chair uncomfort woman pregnant month ask give us anoth tabl uncomfort pregnant woman refus without even tri find solut tri satisfi custom part work still stay tire find anoth restaur also book cancel must pay fee normal especi host receiv dana luckili meal total success cook wonder food delici recommend everyon worth go pleas believ place beauti food tasti especi treatment waiter everyth make us forget bad experi live dana french waiter kevin nice made us magic trick realli attent us yola advis us dish love dish advis final seba attent give us shot one without alcohol knew pregnant thank much waiter thank sure come back hope find anoth manag littl respect custom come spend money menu far low price,average review,3

The service was friendly and helpful, but I felt very rushed - in terms of choosing a drink; then it felt like hurry up what do you want to eat when we had literally had the menu for 30 seconds. The waitress offered to help us choose and when I politely declined one of the recommendations because I don't like coconut milk she argued with me. The food was delivered quick smart and before we had finished our first drink the food had been delivered, eaten and the plates and table items had been whisked away again which had made us feel they wanted to us to eat quickly and leave - which we did. The restaurant is obviously very popular and very busy because when we were leaving they were turning people away who did not have bookings. The food was ok but I would have probably done better if I had been given time to read through the menu options properly without being rushed through to choose. Would I come back? Probably not. I was expecting to spend a nice evening out and we were in and out in 30 minutes. They must be doing something right though because they are obviously very popular.",2019-05-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3688138-Reviews-or120-El_miniBAR-Madrid.html,UID_4409,0.026,0.819,0.155,0.9895,0.3600925925925926,0.4667724867724867,0.36597,1300,131,0.1007692307692307,0,18,False,54,0.1666666666666666,0.2083333333333333,0.2916666666666667,0.0416666666666666,0.2083333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,246,148,4.288617886178862,0,0,googl best tapa bar madrid one came close stay reserv offer us tabl back room upstair accept servic friendli help felt rush term choos drink felt like hurri want eat liter menu second waitress offer help us choos polit declin one recommend like coconut milk argu food deliv quick smart finish first drink food deliv eaten plate tabl item whisk away made us feel want us eat quickli leav restaur obvious popular busi leav turn peopl away book food ok would probabl done better given time read menu option properli without rush choos would come back probabl expect spend nice even minut must someth right though obvious popular,very bad review,1

It makes McDonald's Quarterpounders seem skimpy by comparison!! You have a choice of hard or soft rolls, and you can order fabulous appetizers as well such as chicken tenders or onion rings and the wait staff was always very friendly and attentive...I must mention our waitress, Jimena, who made us feel so welcome and at home, and made sure we had a great meal and an enjoyable time. If you are feeling even the slightest bit homesick for a good old American style hamburger, this is definitely the place you want to eat!! Better yet, prices were extremely reasonable!

We went to 3 different bars and this is one of it. It was amazing and of course it is better than trying to figure it out yourself as there's wide variety of Tapas to choose from. KEVIN - our guide is a very patient man even though it could get really noisy with about 25 of us in the group. The best part of it is to meet people from around the world! There was more than enough food to share and at least 3 glasses of wine per person. Note that this is only one of the three places included in our tour. I would say that's quite generous.

We were initially skeptical as the restaurant was in a very touristy lane near Plaza del Sol, but we were wrong to worry. We came initially on a night after having some underwhelming and overpriced tapas elsewhere. We enjoyed the gazpacho, pork, stuffed peppers, salad and, most of all, the Galician octopus. The food was great - simple, but well prepared - and we had fantastic, friendly service. We were offered a 10% discount card if we returned, so we duly came back the following night and tried some different dishes - the croquettes and pork were highlights. Our waitress (the same as the previous night) was kind enough to give us each a glass of wine on the house.

The waitress provided us with two bite sized bread topped with tuna. It was quite tasty. My husband ordered the Iberian Sirloin Chunk tapa, which was delicious and perfectly cooked with onions, bell peppers, and zucchini. I did order the grilled goat cheese, only because it was a favorite at this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. I never had anything like this and it's worth trying, especially if you get to share it with someone else. It's a lot of cheese for one person, unless you are a serious cheese lover. We did get here early so no reservations needed, but the place was full on a Wednesday evening by the time we left. So, I do recommend that you make reservations if you plan on coming after 8pm.

It's a cracking little restaurant based in the very busy Principe area which is rammed with bars eateries and people- incredibly busy. The restaurant is not massive with I'd guess around twenty tables and has a great vibe. There are plenty of waiters/waitresses so you don't have to wait around if anything is required.  The steaks come with nothing else however the sides are huge, at least big enough for two. I had the tenderloin and it was one of the best steaks I've had, cooked to perfection (rare obviously!). Our waitress Geraldine spoke good English and recommended a great Malbec which wasn't too expensive. She was attentive and good fun and if going to the restaurant definitely ask for her to be your server. The maitre d' was unobtrusive, good, but there if needed and added to the great atmosphere, helped by a free glass of fizz in the front bar afterwards.

We had such an amazing meal and still compare all meals to it now. To start we shared the Provolone cheese and fresh salad. Bread rolls with a gorgeous butter were given too. We then shared a mixed grill for two with chorizo and various cuts of beef and a side order of chips and herbs. All of the food was hot, fresh and so tasty.

For a first time visit, we had to experience the Tapa Breton like everyone else. Our second choice was finished for the night so we accepted the waiters recomendation, Cod and Spinach Cigarellos. Brilliant. We also had to have the G&T as most otthers do. When people say it was the best G&T they have ever had, they should nominate the brand of Gin. There were some 7 options and we had Tanqueray. I think the main ingredient that lifts this above the usual is the tonic water not the aromatics.

The staff of super friendly, the setting is informal and comfortable and the food is simply amazing. We ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad that was unbelievably fresh, some outstanding croquettes that we perfectly cooked and tasted incredible and some squid with garlic aioli that was just fantastic.  Washed down with a couple of beers, you will not be disappointed.  Don't order too much as the portions are very generous (the staff will advise without letting you spend too much and waste food).

We were sat so close to another table you could literally hear every word of their conversation.

Also I ordered medium but it was like rare steak and my friend ordered medium well done and hers was very undercooked?? She had to ask them to cool it again.

I used the restaurants website to request a reservation. Their auto reply said they would contact us to confirm the reservation. They didn't. My daughter who speaks Spanish contacted the restaurant and they did not have our reservation so she made one.  One of the servers seemed annoyed we weren't ordering drinks. Oh well! My family of 4 ordered three Ribeyes, 2 of which were 500kg (1 lb) and a skirt steak which appeared to be about 500 kg, de la Casa salad (Lettuce, Apple, Roquefort cheese, celery and walnuts). The salad was being shared so we requested the Roquefort, which has a bold taste, on the side. They didn't prepare it that way and cheese was sprinkled over the entire salad. That aside, the salad was tasty. I requested my steak be prepared medium-well. This should provide me a light pink inside. The waitress said they would have to cut the meat to get it med-well. I'm assuming she meant butterflyed, but passed on it not wanting a well-done piece of dried out meat. All 3 pieces including the 300 kg (small cut) came out med-rare. We send back a 300 & 500 kg Ribeyes. The smaller cut came back perfect & the larger cut was about the same as originally prepared. The skirts steak is served on a skillet over a mini hibachi. I used the hibachi to cook my Ribeye the rest of the way. Overall, the steak was good, far from great. The only side ordered was a baked potato which was quite tasty. Note: it is typical that beef is prepared more toward rare so be prepared to send it back. Our table was cleared & the check was brought over. We felt rushed!  What about dessert ??? We ordered 3 desserts;  Lemon sorbet Mango sorbet, vodka, caramelized orange and vanilla ice cream  Crepe filled with argentinian artisan caramel cream  The first 2 are actually beverages. The lemon sorbet has rum (?) In it. Both were tasty. Unfortunately, I did not get the crepe I requested & pointed to on the menu. Instead,  I received the Apple crepe flambeé with rum. Before the waitress drenched the poor crepe in rum (nor did it flambeé) we tried telling her. Then she argued with us insisting it was what was ordered.  She returned with a new dessert, but again, the wrong one; 3 small scoops of vanilla ice cream drenched in cheap chocolate sauce. Argentine Beef may be ""The tastiest meat in the world,"" but I would choose any of the Prime steak houses in New York & Boston that I've eaten at over the Argentine cut at  La Cabańa Argentina and their poor service.

The service was excellent from the moment we walked in the door without a reservation. They still found us a table for 4. The waitresses were very helpful with the menu and wine list. We had a nice bottle of Pittacum for under 20 euro. Since we knew the dinner would be large, we just ate bread and olives as our appetizer. My daughter ordered the grilled salmon which came with a nice baked potato (not like an American baked potato). I ordered the veal skewer which came with a halved tomato with a really nice vinaigrette. My husband and son shared a large strip steak at the suggestion of our waitress (which was actually cheaper than their first choice).

Tenía ganas desde hace tiempo de ir a comer alli y me parece que está bien, pero no creo que vaya a volver. El sitio es bonito y tranquilo y los camareros muy amables, pero aunque la calidad es buena, las cantidades no son grandes y el precio es muy alto para lo que dan de comer.

También me parece caro lo que pagamos por dos patatas cocidas pequeñas, que en cualquier otro restaurante te lo ponen de acompañamiento en el mismo plato principal. Y de los precios de los postres ni hablamos. En resumen, muy caro para lo que ofrecen. Muy caro y te quedas con hambre. No, gracias. Bye, bye... I'm sorry but I find it overrated. I had been wanting to eat there for a long time and I think it's fine, but I do not think I'll go back. The place is nice and quiet and the waiters very friendly, but although the quality is good, the quantities are not great and the price is very high for what they give to eat. For example, four euros for a small empanadilla seems to me a very high price. I also find it expensive what I paid for two small potatoes, which at any other restaurant will put it with the same main course. And the prices of the desserts we did not even talk about.

You need to book this restaurant as it's very popular and busy.  Firstly I would like to comment that on the staff. They are very attentive and friendly, explaining the menu.  We ordered some wine which was very reasonable at €16 per bottle.  We both ordered fillet steak which has were absolutely fabulous. The veg was also very good and the portions are large. My only disappointment was the first I ordered. They were with garlic and parsley. The garlic was too strong for me. But if you like garlic, one portion is more than enough for 2.  We only had one course and coffee as all we seem to do in Madrid is eat and drink.  This is well worth the visit, slightly more expensive than the average restaurants but you pay for what you get.

We found this popular spot online, and to be honest, it isn't full of locals. Quite the opposite. There were people from the U.S. (us and others) Japan, other areas of Europe, New Zealand, and Canada that we knew of. And the restaurant definitely has their act together to cater to tourists, but that didn't spoil the experience at all. The decor is cheery, and the restaurant appear to be quite small from the entry, maybe seating 30 people. But having to use the ""facilities"" downstairs had me discovering an even larger lower level with at least another 40 seats. While even the lower level was attractive, I wouldn't want to dine here, so be sure to specify when you make a reservation, and you will need one if you want to eat anytime close to when you arrive, that main floor seating is a priority. It's just that much nicer. As for the food, it was wonderful. Our paella was the best we had in Madrid, though we did enjoy one that was perhaps a whisker superior while in Sevilla.
