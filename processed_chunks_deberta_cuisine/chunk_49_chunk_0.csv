I had the same experience in Italy, it took a few times to get a feel of how the locals operate and are expected to behave in a bar environment like these. First up, with Casa Alberto, being a genuine old bar, the best place is actually at the bar, standing. The staff are not rude but just efficient. Order a drink such as the popular vermouth (vermut) or a caña of beer, you will be given tapas of different kinds. The food is classic Madrid and their oxtail stew (rabo), snails (caracoles) and Madrid style offal which is tripe, pig snout, ears, blood sausage (callos) were outstanding and have not had anywhere that topped it in my travels.

Almost passed this restaurant up because we prefer to eat outdoors weather permitting. We are so glad we braved the noise and crowds to eat here. My husband, daughter and I each ordered a Sangria which arrived in large glasses and with a free tapa of chorizo mini sausages in a tasty sauce with little strips of toast. We ordered three tapas to share; huevos y jamon over piping hot, crispy French fries, gambas(grilled whole shrimp) and paella marisco (seafood). I couldn't believe how large the plates of food were and didn't think we could eat all of it, but somehow we managed. A complimentary basket of bread accompanied our meal.

Well, so do I, and a LOT. Like always, every city I go I look for an Indian restaraunt, and I found this one on tripadvisor.  When i went there I found the place a little cheap, i had my doubts. We got served right away with a very friendly waiter. He reccommend us some plates when we asked for spice.  Right away we received a yummy kind of crunchy thin bread and some sauces, really good. Then we ordered 5 plates( tandoorri, shrimp curry, massala, chutney mango and another one i forgot), 2 side rices and 3 breads(paratah, garlic naan and naan). The food was a little slow tbh. But it didnt matter, as soon as i tasted the massala, i got swept away. It was delicious, just like the other plates. The naans were on point, but like Mei Mei C wrote the paratah want that great honestly. But still, delicious. Now, the food is cheap but it tastes expensive and theres a lot of food, we even left some( and there were 5 hungry, indian cusine lovers). And the water was the bomb too.

Then I had the meat samosa, and butter chicken with white rice. I asked for the butter chicken to be spiced up a bit extra, and they were happy to oblige. Feroz as well as the rest of the staff provided excellent service, and I even got a super yummy mango lassi on the house. A point of improvement might be the interior; the red gingham tablecloths along with the green chair covers don't really match. The pictures on the walls are beautiful, but the interior maybe needs to be rearranged in order to be consistent with the traditional image of the restaurant.

There was a lot of fish on offer, which we didnt try alot of. However I tried 5 selections from one vender which were all stone cold, and tasted like cheap supermarket party nibbles (Iceland in the UK came to mind as being superior). However there is a lady selling Italian food, We got a slice of Lasagna to reheat for our sleeping toddler later - it was very good for 2 euros. The central bar selling lots of food also had decent batatas bravas. The wine is nice from the stall in the middle of the cheese and meat counters (5.50 for two small chunks of warm cheese, hard bread and small glass of wine). The lady selling a wide array of desserts/patisserie at one end could not have been ruder to my wife who was spending 15 euros on some treats - terrible service. This is clearly just a tourist trap that will quickly draw money from your wallet for very average food.

A bad start with the beer: ordered a draught Mahou which arrived cloudy and with a very slight cleaning fluidy taste. I also had the impression from the thinness that it was watered down, which happens quite a bit in cheap restaurants. Twenty years of drinking beer (almost as much of a fan as Judge Kavanaugh is) and you get to know what’s been messed with. So I pointed this out and was going to ask for a bottled beer instead, but the waiter looked annoyed, argued that there was nothing wrong, but immediately replaced it with another, equally cloudy and watery one. Maybe not the first complaint. So after sending that back I ordered a bottle of Mahou - same stuff - which when poured was crisp clear and just right. The attitude of the waiter was hostile at this point so I thought about walking out, just paying for the beer, but I had ordered the two courses at the start, and it was raining, so hey ho.  Dhal soup was good: quite garlicky, hot and tasty. Vindaloo also was fine, boneless chicken and a medium dry sauce, about the spiciness I was expecting. Rice was also perfectly fine. No complaints about the food. This is a cheap-looking place, one of about ten in the neighbourhood, and one of the most successful, it looks like, but they must sort out their draught beer, and not cheat the customers. A trading standards officer would be all over them in the U.K. - if there’s a Spanish one around, please go test the beer purity! At least they did not even try to charge for the two draught beers. If you go here, stick to the bottled beer, but I would try another curry place if I were you given the unfriendliness of the staff. The curry tasted good but the attitude (and the adulterated draught Mahou) left a bad taste in the mouth.",2018-10-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1047563-Reviews-or10-Moharaj-Madrid.html,UID_12989,0.049,0.819,0.132,0.9842,0.0671018945212493,0.4526753712237583,0.47328125,1796,157,0.0874164810690423,1,50,False,66,0.108433734939759,0.144578313253012,0.2409638554216867,0.0602409638554216,0.0843373493975903,0.072289156626506,0.0481927710843373,0.0481927710843373,0.144578313253012,0.0481927710843373,335,200,4.361194029850746,0,0,busi weekday night good sign bad start beer order draught mahou arriv cloudi slight clean fluidi tast also impress thin water happen quit bit cheap restaur twenti year drink beer almost much fan judg kavanaugh get know mess point go ask bottl beer instead waiter look annoy argu noth wrong immedi replac anoth equal cloudi wateri one mayb first complaint send back order bottl mahou stuff pour crisp clear right attitud waiter hostil point thought walk pay beer order two cours start rain hey ho dhal soup good quit garlicki hot tasti vindaloo also fine boneless chicken medium dri sauc spici expect rice also perfectli fine complaint food cheap look place one ten neighbourhood one success look like must sort draught beer cheat custom trade standard offic would u k spanish one around pleas go test beer puriti least even tri charg two draught beer go stick bottl beer would tri anoth curri place given unfriendli staff curri tast good attitud adulter draught mahou left bad tast mouth,bad review,2,Indian

Everyone on the bar looked delicious and the people drinking and chatting gave a good vibe. So, I asked for a table in back because the menu featured some items I really wanted to try. Began with a wonderfully fresh salad, then enjoyed the chipirones which were also among the best I've had in Spain.

It is a pleasure to find that someplace this unique has not changed (so many places have) except for maybe the clientelle, which seems now to be largely made up of fussy tourists.  On this most recent trip we finally had formal dining in the back room, having previously just gone tapas-crazy in the front area. It was a truly fine dining experience: sweetbreads for me and merluza for my wife, served with care and pride--we are still talking about it. If you just need some wine and tapas, order the albondegas (spicey meatballs in a rich sauce) and the house red wine. If you feel underserved, ripped-off or in any other way dissatisfied (as some previous posters seem to be complaining of) just give up on experiencing the real Madrid.

The sweetbreads with mushrooms is one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Then I took my girlfriend to Madrid for her 30th and found it again (after some hunting - I'd been drunk when I left before). It didn't disappoint.  Don't bother going into the restaurant just stand/sit in the bar at the front and order lots of tapas plates with red wine. The staff are lovely and will help you if you're unsure (they didn't want to bring me sweetbreads until I reassured them I knew what they were)  This is my happy place and one day I'll go there after having watched Wolves win the Champions League in the Bernabeu and be the happiest person in the whole world,2013-06-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or360-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_39537,0.041,0.767,0.192,0.9837,0.3636363636363636,0.5227272727272727,0.4324285714285714,805,78,0.0968944099378882,0,20,False,30,0.1153846153846153,0.1538461538461538,0.1538461538461538,0.0384615384615384,0.1538461538461538,0.0769230769230769,0.0384615384615384,0.0384615384615384,0.1538461538461538,0.0769230769230769,152,112,4.282894736842105,0,0,stumbl across place madrid sat bar drink red wine eat plate plate food amaz sweetbread mushroom one best thing ever eaten took girlfriend madrid th found hunt drunk left disappoint bother go restaur stand sit bar front order lot tapa plate red wine staff love help unsur want bring sweetbread reassur knew happi place one day go watch wolv win champion leagu bernabeu happiest person whole world,good review,4,Spanish

We got in and there was a wait which was fine. It is a very small place so we had to wait in the tapas bit of the restaurant. As we were waiting, one of the waiters in the tapas section was so rude - my mother was slightly in his way but we didn't realise. He could have said excuse me - but instead he just pushed her away and made what sounded like a very abrupt comment as he did this. No apology or acknowledgement of this. We were so hungry and the waiter who had asked us to wait had been nice so we decided to still wait. When we did eventually get seated the food I found was quite expensive for what it was and lacked real flavor - it was all very bland and disappointing. If you do go there do not order the soup! It had soggy bread and egg in it...yuck! Though the waiters who all spoke English were friendly. They were not very attentive. They took a while to get things for us that we asked for. The only positive was the setting - we were seated at the back with lots of pictures and signed photographs of bull fighters so it had a nice feel to it and that for me was the only redeeming part of my experience. I would however not recommend as its overpriced and the food and customer service leaves a lot to be desired.",2013-05-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or360-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_39539,0.041,0.862,0.097,0.951,0.0380345412163594,0.5924740411104047,0.4877066666666667,1376,162,0.1177325581395348,2,25,False,61,0.14,0.1,0.24,0.02,0.16,0.02,0.02,0.0,0.24,0.06,275,152,4.007272727272727,0,0,review restaur bit recommend restaur old meant nice restaur visit got wait fine small place wait tapa bit restaur wait one waiter tapa section rude mother slightli way realis could said excus instead push away made sound like abrupt comment apolog acknowledg hungri waiter ask us wait nice decid still wait eventu get seat food found quit expens lack real flavor bland disappoint go order soup soggi bread egg yuck though waiter spoke english friendli attent took get thing us ask posit set seat back lot pictur sign photograph bull fighter nice feel redeem part experi would howev recommend overpr food custom servic leav lot desir,bad review,2,Spanish

We stopped at a shop called shandy I think, asked for a chicken pasty and a small quiche (6 euros for the 2) , the lady tried to keep selling us other stuff that she had loads of and said do you want this cheese croquette at 2.50, I said no thanks and she said so you don’t like cheese then and gave me a funny look, I said no just the things we’ve ordered, I was almost ready to walk away at this point but gave her a 20 note and she gave me change of a 10 mostly in coppers, I told her it was wrong and she reluctantly gave me a 10 note. Maybe it was just this one stall but it really put us off. The market has a wonderful array of foods and drinks but be prepared to spend a fortune if your hungry or thirsty.  My tip is to go in, walk round everything, take pictures then go outside and find another place to eat/drink.

Since my lunch at Jiro in Ginza last year, I have not found such a pure Japanese restaurant in the world (apart Nakazawa, NYC). Kappo has the advantage of having access to a large variety of fresh fish from the Atlantic and Mediterranean sea. This is what I look for in a Japanese restaurant: 1) Dedication and 2) Fresh produce.  The nigiri is served like in Japan, one by one in a relatively quick cadence allowing you to taste 16-18 delicious nigiris. I don't look for Nobu or Zuma style Japanese with inventive appetizers and tiraditos etc. What I look is for the lukewarm rice with the best fish on top. Full stop. It is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the world. I would rank it 3rd in the world behind Jiro (Tokyo) and Nakazawa (NYC).

The pub is modern, with the brewing equipment on view. The young lady serving was very helpful with beer choices and serving to our table. We ordered sausage and cheese tapas with wonderful dark crusty beer bread. The cheese was served in oil and was very mature, ideal with beer. The craft beer was excellent.

Fabrica Maravillas serve beers that they brew right there on site. As a huge fan of 'craft' beer, and as a novice homebrewer myself, this place really appealed to me. You can see the fermenters behind the bar. Brilliant stuff. The beers were absolutely fantastic and I didn't have a bad one and we were there all night. You could have smaller 'third' size glasses which mean that you could try a few. The bar lady (sorry I didn't get your name) was friendly, very knowledgeable and passionate about the beers and she was a credit to the bar.  I guess some people would say it's slightly expensive but I don't think it is when you consider what you are getting.

Its been completely redone in the past 10 years, the iron and glass mercado that had fallen into disrepair but it has been beautifully redone (and is now a certified “green” building). Its home to about thirty vendors selling everything from coffee and pastries to ham and wine. There wasn’t a single thing in this market that wasn’t delicious. We made it here everyday (one day even twice) to grab a meal. Its an excellent mix of local people and tourists. Its interesting to watch the change in the crowd through out the day, the morning is filled with many families and tourists looking for a meal but at night (its open late, because its Spain) it turns into an awesome place to have a glass of Sangria or wine while eating some delicious thing you just bought off one of the stands. Be warned though, at times this market is packed (so packed I can’t walk anywhere without spilling my wine, and not from having too much). This is why night time is the best time to go, or just don’t go on a weekend. We went Monday before we caught the metro to the airport and we basically had the place to ourselves.

Probably not for everyone because you do pay more for the presentation but to us it was worth every penny. It can be tough to find a seat but if you're not in a rush you will eventually get one. I suggest going on an empty stomach and when you have lots of free time.  As for the food, here are a few of our faves: 1. The mozzarella bar located in one of the back corner - here you can get whipped mozzarella with various toppings. It is like nothing I've ever tasted before - so yummy! 2. Meat cones from the meat vendors - different types available and all delicious! 3. The sweets vendor - here we got churros con chocolate, macarons and a slice of meringue cake - all were fab!

They have similar menus and seems like the tapes menu is one diverse and smaller portions of the already really rich hearty dishes.  We sat in the restaurant area which has a completely different vibe than the bustling downstairs where you walk in. I was a little intimidated by the crowd but which we stayed down there. Up at the top the menu is 3 times the prices of the same things you can get down below.  I got the Callos Tripe dish, I am not familiar with Spanish cuisine but this looked good and was well worth the adventure. Stewed in a thick roux type stew with sausages the Tripe is soft and gets a very smokey and distinct flavour. One of those which unfortunately you can't have too much of, and it becomes overpowering.  Hubby got the suckling lamb chops mostly because the server talked him out of the lamb knuckle, which we kind of wished we had tried. Didn't really appreciate that. The lamb was okay but he wasn't impressed with the fries that came with it.  At the price we paid it's over priced. If you were to do tapas I think is more reasonable.  The place is super tiny and even with a hand full of tables there are 4 servers running around and serving at a good pace. Except when they split my wine bottle. Twice.  There's apparently a bit of history to do with bullfighters hanging out here as of the 1800s.

But the grilled prawns are the best I've had in Spain. Perfectly grilled with sprinkles of sea salt--the chef lets the sweetness and freshness of the huge tender shrimps shine on its own without messing it up with spices. Wow! I devoured the whole plate all by myself and wanted a second had my stomach not been so full. We came here because of all the raves about the gambas a la plancha and it did not disappoint. We also ordered a salad and it was huge. In fact, most plates we saw that came out were huge. We ordered bulls tail stew and that was quite yummy as well. Just wished we had rice to eat with the gravy. When we tried to order another item, the waitress shook her head and told us we already had a lot of food. Glad we heeded her advice. Along with the free sausage tapas, we were stuffed. Our waitress deserves an award for waitress extraordinaire. Fast, efficient and stayed on top of things in spite of a full house with just another waitress working. I have never seen anyone hustle the way she did. Touristy? yes. But what do you expect in Plaza del Sol?  Great food? can only vouch for the gambas plancha, oxtail and tuna salad.

All of the places in the Plaza seemed identical and we were looking for something more unique. We strolled a block from the plaza and found Casa Alberto, a tapas bar that's been around since 1827. We were outside looking at the menu and the server invited us in, we came in and ordered beer at the bar and were offered a delicious snack while we waited for one of the tables in the bar to open up. We didn't have to wait long & we sat down and ordered 3 tapas, all were amazing! We had the veal meatballs, stuffed peppers and a meat ravioli. The guy that runs the show in the bar area is awesome! He suggested that we try the Mascarpone Cheesecake with Rasberry Sorbet for dessert and it was outstanding! We told him how much we enjoyed our meal and he said that we should come back tomorrow night for another dessert. We would have, but sadly this was our final meal in Madrid as we were leaving in the morning. I plan on making Casa Alberto the first place we stop when we return to Madrid! Great value also, if we had eaten in the Plaza we would've spent twice as much, and neither the food nor the atmosphere would have been nearly as good.",2014-08-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or310-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_39748,0.032,0.875,0.093,0.942,0.3135233918128655,0.5893274853801169,0.4950454545454545,1233,120,0.097323600973236,4,23,False,64,0.1428571428571428,0.2,0.2571428571428571,0.0571428571428571,0.1714285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142857142857142,0.0571428571428571,240,149,4.141666666666667,0,0,wife plan eat plaza santa ana night found casa alberto place plaza seem ident look someth uniqu stroll block plaza found casa alberto tapa bar around sinc outsid look menu server invit us came order beer bar offer delici snack wait one tabl bar open wait long sat order tapa amaz veal meatbal stuf pepper meat ravioli guy run show bar area awesom suggest tri mascarpon cheesecak rasberri sorbet dessert outstand told much enjoy meal said come back tomorrow night anoth dessert would sadli final meal madrid leav morn plan make casa alberto first place stop return madrid great valu also eaten plaza would spent twice much neither food atmospher would nearli good,good review,4,Spanish

We were a bit early, so had a drink and tapas and enjoyed the wonderful interior. It may attract quite a few tourists, so be deemed less than fully authentic, but for us as tourists it was a great little bar and the waiters were of the traditional sort rather than youngsters. When the kitchen was ready we went into the back room for our meal, again a wonderful atmospheric interior with the walls covered in memorabilia. The service was great, friendly whilst remaining formal, the food was excellent, dishes came out regularly without delays and even though it was a tasting menu, we felt well fed by the end. Altogether there were six small courses, bread, 2 glasses of wine each, water and a gin and tonic each, all for €40 for two of us. This was better value than we had had at other nearby restaurants and much better food. It's not hugely fancy, just nice, well prepared food, and an enjoyable evening. We enjoyed it so much we went back again a couple of nights later, and were still impressed.

It looked 'traditional' enough, but we soon realized that the whole place was chock-full with older looking English-speaking tourists, which is generally not a good sign in a Spanish restaurant.  We decided to test the quality of the food with our ""Rabo del Toro"" test. Rabo del Toro or Oxtail stew is a very typical Spanish dish from the south, and we have had some darn good samples in a couple of small taverns in downtown Madrid. We figured, if the Rabo del Toro of Casa Alberto was even better than that of our favorite tavern (which serves it at half the price), then Casa Alberto was a keeper.  Apart from the snooty waiters and chaotic atmosphere (but not in a good way), the food itself was the real disappointment. It had none of the rich smoky flavor of the previous Oxtail Stews we had eaten, and we honestly felt cheated. Plus, I really hate it when restaurants serve you bread without asking and then charge you for it - which is what these guys did.  I think this place may have been very good back in the day, but now it's just a tourist magnet, and completed overrated when it comes to the food.

Planned on going out to a highly rated restaurant a 15 minute cab ride out of town but found it booked out. Bar was crowded but tables available at back. Fellow behind bar indicated full but man at top of stairs indicated he would find us a table. Did so by splitting a table for 4. We thought he was laying it on but 20 minutes later not a table available. Heavy carved wood deco and very colorful. Wife reckons it would make a perfect impressionist painting. Food was good and serves generous. My entree of squid and zucchini ravioli with squid ink sauce was terrific. Could have shared between two. The Iberian pork was superb. Cooked medium rare with caramelised onion. Made me aware of how foul our pumped up pork is back home. This tasted like meat unlike pumped up plastic from pen fed animals. So food is ok. Wine good. A red El Moro about €22. This was recommended by a local diner. But it is the vibrancy of place which excels. Full of locals enjoying themselves. We did also.

We arrived, did not know much about the menu or wine. The waiter, Herman, who looks after the tapas bar, gave us 2 glasses of white wine which went down a treat (wine from Reuda region). The food was excellent - calamari & croquettes. You receive free basket of bread and the bread is so good it reminds me of bread from France. Our wine glasses emptied pretty quick, we looked around to get another, and suddenly it was ordered for us and delivered to us. Food was also efficient in arriving. We ended going back another night & Herman gave us a table ahead of others as we were repeat offenders. He gave us the same wine again, but this time we ordered different food.

The service was good each time and the food the first two was quite good. We had steak, fries and a couple of other things, not remembered right now, but left with the impression that the restaurant was reasonably priced with decent food and good service. Now comes the However. Our last visit, I had researched where to find good paella in Madrid and somehow thought I had come up with this the Alhambra. Since we stayed quite close, I went over to ask if they made paella and they said sure, but only starting at 8:30pm (1st tip off). At around 8:45pm we went over, ordered a bottle of wine and ordered paella for 3. Freshly made paella takes a minimum of 30-45 minutes to cook so we settled in to drink and chat. All three plates of paella were out within 5 minutes. I can't guarante anything, but this paella looked and tasted previously cooked. It was disgusting. Three bites and we were ready to leave. Called the waitress and asked for our check. When she saw us leaving full plates, she asked how we liked the paella, so I told her the truth, that it was terrible. Upside and my kudos for the restuarant management!! She brought us the check immediately. The check did not and I'll repeat this, did not, have charges for the paella. They charged us for the wine and water we had ordered and drank and dropped off the food charges. All in all, this is a good place to eat in Madrid. Would not have gone three times if we didn't think so. Just beware the paella. The other stuff is good, reasonably priced, and the place is alway busy.",2015-02-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1775780-Reviews-or370-Taberna_Alhambra-Madrid.html,UID_39817,0.045,0.83,0.126,0.9799,0.1828042328042328,0.5194297472075251,0.3737428571428571,1577,139,0.0881420418516169,2,47,False,80,0.1527777777777778,0.1388888888888889,0.25,0.0972222222222222,0.1527777777777778,0.0277777777777777,0.0277777777777777,0.0416666666666666,0.0833333333333333,0.0277777777777777,295,182,4.349152542372881,0,0,last month ate three time servic good time food first two quit good steak fri coupl thing rememb right left impress restaur reason price decent food good servic come howev last visit research find good paella madrid somehow thought come alhambra sinc stay quit close went ask made paella said sure start pm st tip around pm went order bottl wine order paella freshli made paella take minimum minut cook settl drink chat three plate paella within minut guarant anyth paella look tast previous cook disgust three bite readi leav call waitress ask check saw us leav full plate ask like paella told truth terribl upsid kudo restuar manag brought us check immedi check repeat charg paella charg us wine water order drank drop food charg good place eat madrid would gone three time think bewar paella stuff good reason price place alway busi,good review,4,Spanish

Picking a tasting menu of 4 dishes our impressions of this place were amazing. The service staff were very helpful in explaining the dishes and were very quick in attendance. The venue itself is good visually as it is set within an area that supplies a small courtyard. Our dishes were presented quickly and visually appealing. The taste matched the presentation. Each serving was very generous and showcased great tastes of Spain. We felt that this was a very good introduction to Madrid. Dinner After returning from seeing sights around the city we again chose to eat at the hotel. Unfortunately this experience was the direct opposite to our first. The service staff were rude and unhelpful. We had bought water to take to our rooms and we were told on several occasions that we would have to buy our own. We had purchased drinks at the restaurant and had no intentions of drinking out pre purchased water. After ordering a light meal of 3 tapas our first meal was burnt, our second was not cooked through and the third was forgotten. It was hard to get hold of the staff to inform them of this and at the end we decided to not get it. For this the staff did take some of the price off the bill which was appreciated but the experience was greatly different from our first meal. To sum up, this place is not the cheapest but after our first meal we were satisfied with the experience. As for our second time, it was terrible and not worth the expense (though the burnt plate was taken from the bill).",2014-08-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2655778-Reviews-or120-La_Antonita-Madrid.html,UID_2300,0.046,0.887,0.067,0.7608,0.1662121212121212,0.446111111111111,0.3688117647058823,1594,153,0.0959849435382685,0,23,False,65,0.1282051282051282,0.1282051282051282,0.2051282051282051,0.0512820512820512,0.1282051282051282,0.0256410256410256,0.0769230769230769,0.0512820512820512,0.1538461538461538,0.0512820512820512,290,163,4.5,0,0,first meal stay hotel link restaur first lunch upon arriv pick tast menu dish impress place amaz servic staff help explain dish quick attend venu good visual set within area suppli small courtyard dish present quickli visual appeal tast match present serv gener showcas great tast spain felt good introduct madrid dinner return see sight around citi chose eat hotel unfortun experi direct opposit first servic staff rude unhelp bought water take room told sever occas would buy purchas drink restaur intent drink pre purchas water order light meal tapa first meal burnt second cook third forgotten hard get hold staff inform end decid get staff take price bill appreci experi greatli differ first meal sum place cheapest first meal satisfi experi second time terribl worth expens though burnt plate taken bill,bad review,2,Spanish

The atmosphere was nice, with an old church under glass at our feet (no explantion of this anywhere, but we asked), but the place was crowded. We asked for the non-smoking section. The menu was printed, but the printer was not working well and the copy we got was so badly printed, we could not read it. The other copy we asked for had obviously been printed by the same printer when it was running out of ink and it was no more legible. The menu I received was half in English and half in Spanish. The problem was that it did not describe the dishes well. There was a chalk board above our heads with menu items and the two were different from one another. I ordered chorizo and I expected a hot, sausage-like dish and instead I received a plate of cold meat on wax paper. While it was delicious, I would have liked some description of what I ordered. There was not much explanation offered by the server either. The grilled vegetables we ordered were delicious! While the food was very good, the portions were not generous and our dinner came to 46 Euros. We left after the meal, intending to order coffee and dessert elsewhere.

The best part is that you can choose the quantity of A PARTICULAR thing that you see on display. The place is definitely more expensive than other say Mercado de San Anton which is small but you will find more local people at San Antonio. The vermouth on tap is super tasty and gets you ready for a gastronomic experience that is the tapa. Being right next to Plaza Mayor, Royal Plaza and Sol area , one can cover that above area and head to Mercado de San Miguel for lunch / dinner. If you have just arrived at Madrid and yet to discover what kind of tapas you will like, it is best to hit this place and experience the variety that is available. This will beat the Tapas tour if you are ko on your own and need some fair idea of what food to try in Madrid. It's definitely more expensive than other places but you get to try super small portions like say 1 peice of something if you wanna try.... I definitely recommend it for  1. Good vermouth on tap 2.

So, La Antoñita was my favorite place for fancy and delicious tapas. It´s not cheap but I used to think it was worth it – (amazing food, good ambience, great service). I am originally from London but for the next year, I am living and working in Madrid. Therefore when friends and family come to visit, La Antoñita is where I take my loved ones to impress them and give them a good meal!!!  So, after visiting this restaurant FIVE times in the last FIVE months, I decided to take one of my best friends there on Saturday night for dinner on their terraza/coralla, I booked for 9pm – we got there at around 8.50pm. We were then seated; restaurant was still dead as the Spanish don´t usually go out to eat that early!  We ordered two glasses of wine and bread to start – both good. As we had a late lunch, we decided to just order the patatas bravas, ham croquettes and the ribs as I have had these dishes multiple times here and have loved them each time!  Our patatas bravas came, you could tell they had been rushed as they were literally just fried and thrown into the box. – not crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, just fried. Next came our croquettes – HUGE disappointment, in fact I do not even know HOW these were allowed to be sent out the kitchen! They literally looked like someone had eaten them and then thrown them back up! I´m pretty sure croquettes are meant to be fried and crispy on the outside, these were soggy and broken. Nevertheless, I gave them the benefit of the doubt by eating them and not complaining even though they were cold in the middle, just YUCK!  Now for the huge disappointment, the Mango Ribs! These are usually so tasty! Well cooked, meat falls off the bone, full of flavor type thing. The ones we were served on Saturday looked like they had been boiled, were raw pink on the inside with lots of veins and spots of blood. Tasted disgusting. Bearing in mind these were 15euros for a small slab of mini ribs, at this point I did decide to send these back.  The waitress took them back to the kitchen and asked if we wanted something else, by this point my friend and I were just fed up! We did however (and I don’t know why we did this), order another portion of patatas bravas (I think because we felt like we actually had to order something else). These came, we barely touched them.  What really annoyed me was that I looked around at everyone else´s food and it looked nothing like what we had been served. For the rest of the night, we were stared at by members of staff and given DIRTY LOOKS. My friend and I felt very uncomfortable so we decided to ask for the bill. The waitress actually had the audacity to ask us if we wanted dessert. Erm, no thanks.  Our bill came to 28euros, you´re thinking not bad for dinner?- I wish, we paid that for two small glasses of wine, bread, a bottle of water, TWO mushy croquettes and potatoes. Such a shame.  Even though the food was awful, I was willing to give La Antoñita ANOTHER chance but the rude staff has put me off ever returning here not to mention that it is utterly embarrassing when you take a friend who is only visiting Madrid for the weekend to a terrible restaurant!  I think it is safe to say that La Antoñita have lost a very loyal and valuable customer (pleas bear in mind that when I have visited here in the past, I tend to have cocktails, dinner, dessert and coffee and my bill tips over the 80euro mark for just TWO people).  Do I recommend you go here? NO. – My last words to this restaurant, YOUR LOSS Antoñita.",2013-11-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2655778-Reviews-or120-La_Antonita-Madrid.html,UID_1748,0.087,0.757,0.156,0.9957,0.0317702169625246,0.4915450361604209,0.5212114285714285,3660,332,0.0907103825136612,12,89,False,140,0.0546875,0.1171875,0.2421875,0.0390625,0.1328125,0.0546875,0.0546875,0.0703125,0.15625,0.078125,684,352,4.337719298245614,0,0,recent review restaur septemb discov june visit multipl time sinc la anto ita favorit place fanci delici tapa cheap use think worth amaz food good ambienc great servic origin london next year live work madrid therefor friend famili come visit la anto ita take love one impress give good meal visit restaur five time last five month decid take one best friend saturday night dinner terraza coralla book pm got around pm seat restaur still dead spanish usual go eat earli order two glass wine bread start good late lunch decid order patata brava ham croquett rib dish multipl time love time patata brava came could tell rush liter fri thrown box crispi outsid fluffi insid fri next came croquett huge disappoint fact even know allow sent kitchen liter look like someon eaten thrown back pretti sure croquett meant fri crispi outsid soggi broken nevertheless gave benefit doubt eat complain even though cold middl yuck huge disappoint mango rib usual tasti well cook meat fall bone full flavor type thing one serv saturday look like boil raw pink insid lot vein spot blood tast disgust bear mind euro small slab mini rib point decid send back waitress took back kitchen ask want someth els point friend fed howev know order anoth portion patata brava think felt like actual order someth els came bare touch realli annoy look around everyon els food look noth like serv rest night stare member staff given dirti look friend felt uncomfort decid ask bill waitress actual audac ask us want dessert erm thank bill came euro think bad dinner wish paid two small glass wine bread bottl water two mushi croquett potato shame even though food aw will give la anto ita anoth chanc rude staff put ever return mention utterli embarrass take friend visit madrid weekend terribl restaur think safe say la anto ita lost loyal valuabl custom plea bear mind visit past tend cocktail dinner dessert coffe bill tip euro mark two peopl recommend go last word restaur loss anto ita,bad review,2,Spanish

The service was punctual and friendly, and my minimal Spanish and some mutual effort got us through the ordering process. I was disappointed with the food, unfortanately. The pork carpaccio was thick and hammy, and honestly just didn't taste much of anything. I followed this with a pasta dish which, while the pasta was cooked well was doused in oil to an excessive degree, and just wasn't enjoyable as a result. Having missed breakfast I did finish it, but if I hadn't been starving I would not have. I was surprised at this as this restaurant appears in the Michelin guide and so I expected excellent food. It is perfectly possible I just ordered the wrong things, or that the chef was disinterested due to the lateness of my meal, however going on my experience I would not reccommend this to others, or eat here again while in Madrid.",2018-03-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8661987-Reviews-or30-Atlantik_Corner-Madrid.html,UID_39850,0.047,0.82,0.133,0.953,0.075,0.6222222222222222,0.5617714285714285,1006,92,0.0914512922465208,1,25,False,29,0.125,0.125,0.3,0.025,0.175,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.15,0.05,178,122,4.657303370786517,0,0,arriv quit late spanish lunch standard around pm howev upon locat waitress seat happi accept lunch thumb servic punctual friendli minim spanish mutual effort got us order process disappoint food unfortan pork carpaccio thick hammi honestli tast much anyth follow pasta dish pasta cook well dous oil excess degre enjoy result miss breakfast finish starv would surpris restaur appear michelin guid expect excel food perfectli possibl order wrong thing chef disinterest due late meal howev go experi would reccommend other eat madrid,bad review,2,Spanish

It was a neat set up and atmosphere, and a good way to try different food. The paella guy was super nice and the vegetarian paella was DELICIOUS. Cheese plate tapas was a must. Olive bar was also excellent. We got good wine from 2 different bars.  The one downside was the woman running the place that sold big empanadas, small empanadas, croquettes, etc near one of the corners. She gave us a bunch of stuff we didn't order charged us for it (I'm assuming bc we were tourists), and it wasn't even good. It was greasy and just bad. I didn't catch a picture, but she was one of only 2 places selling the little empanada pastries (she sold them for like 2.50 euro instead of the place that had them for 3.25/3.75 with the large selection.

With the many stalls in the market selling wines, desserts and all sorts of food, you will find that even getting to the display counters is a battle to fight your way through. My advice is to 1st find a seat and settle down before making any attempt to look for food or drinks. Vinod are cheap but given the food is just so so, it is not cheap.

The service on arrival was a little brusque, but it was efficient. We placed the order and the waiter did warn me against my selection of pig's trotter but I chose it anyway. For starters we had croquetas which were good and in a generous portion and smoked salmon, wrapped around cream cheese and prawns which was a bit strange. My pig's trotter main was not enjoyable but it was completely my own fault for ignoring the waiter's advice. My partner's main of lamb chops were boney and gristly, and had a bitter taste. Overall we didn't enjoy the food, but maybe if we had eaten in the tapas bar at the front we would have liked it more.

It had atmosphere and style and felt very local and authentic. We waited about 30 minutes for a table and stood at the bar to wait. We were given free beer and a tapas while we waited (good!) Once our table was ready we were seated at last. My dad got the tripe, and it was a portion big enough for three people. When it comes to tripe I'm not sure that's a good thing. My dad said it was nothing special to boot.  I had the steak and while it was juicy and cooked the way I wanted it was quite stringy and very hard to cut. Really, I needed a steak knife twice as sharp to do the job. The fries were dry and dehydrated.  The service was indifferent... Our waiter just kind of threw our cutlery down in s haphazard way.

We were directed to the tables located opposite the bar and waited there where I was told we would be served by one of the members of staff there. Our drink orders were taken first, and drinks turned out to be quite cheap. The menu was in Spanish only - which wasn't a problem - and the waiters' knowledge of English was not too bad. The bar when we arrived at about 8 o'clock was still quite quiet, but by the end was brimming with people, both by the bar and then people waiting to have our table on the way out. It has a long history in Madrid, and its décor really celebrates what is a traditional tapas bar with few frills, its walls filled with photos, its bar replete with bottles. It was a really visually appealing and warm place to eat in. As for the service, we were disapointed. The waiter that attended to us was very brusque in his manner, as while I was ordering in Spanish, and deciding amongst my family what we were definitely going for from the menu, decided to just walk off and go to another table or to the bar. I thought this was very unusual and extremely rude, and his demeanour for the rest of the meal continued so. The food was no disappointment, and the traditional side of the tapas bar showed itself in well cooked tapas favourites, like patatas bravas and ham croquettes. We also ordered a fresh salad and were given bread and olives, which is standard. Other tapas included a morcilla 'brownie' with goat's cheese on top, which looked and tasted delicious, and I believe we also some Padrón peppers, which are always delicious. Looking on Trip Advisor, there are lots of amazing-looking dishes that we didn't ordered, but would be sure to when/if we visit next time. Our final tapa of the night really took us by surprise - it was called a tortilla invertida. A green pepper stuffed with a potato and egg tortilla, with a sauce on top. It was so surprising to see a traditional tapas bar serve a really accomplished and slightly left-field dish. It was not only a thing of beauty, but made for a really delicious tapa. The bar also had a restaurant at the back with a table service, which seemed to booked up when I enquired. What turned out to be a bit of an offputting service didn't take away from what was a delicious tapas experience, and even better, it was less than a minute's walk from our apartment. The atmosphere by the end was buzzing and very warming, and we were reluctant to leave, were it not for the fact that others wanted our table. We were well and truly convinced we were located in the best part of the city to sample the cream of the crop, in terms of tapas.",2014-12-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or290-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_39931,0.014,0.825,0.161,0.998,0.1896180555555555,0.4891782407407408,0.5093380952380953,2721,263,0.0966556413083425,0,65,False,124,0.088235294117647,0.1470588235294117,0.3235294117647059,0.0588235294117647,0.1029411764705882,0.0147058823529411,0.0294117647058823,0.0588235294117647,0.1029411764705882,0.0735294117647058,507,275,4.368836291913215,0,0,walk tapa bar servic behind bar slow acknowledg quit curt direct tabl locat opposit bar wait told would serv one member staff drink order taken first drink turn quit cheap menu spanish problem waiter knowledg english bad bar arriv clock still quit quiet end brim peopl bar peopl wait tabl way long histori madrid cor realli celebr tradit tapa bar frill wall fill photo bar replet bottl realli visual appeal warm place eat servic disapoint waiter attend us brusqu manner order spanish decid amongst famili definit go menu decid walk go anoth tabl bar thought unusu extrem rude demeanour rest meal continu food disappoint tradit side tapa bar show well cook tapa favourit like patata brava ham croquett also order fresh salad given bread oliv standard tapa includ morcilla browni goat chees top look tast delici believ also padr n pepper alway delici look trip advisor lot amaz look dish order would sure visit next time final tapa night realli took us surpris call tortilla invertida green pepper stuf potato egg tortilla sauc top surpris see tradit tapa bar serv realli accomplish slightli left field dish thing beauti made realli delici tapa bar also restaur back tabl servic seem book enquir turn bit offput servic take away delici tapa experi even better less minut walk apart atmospher end buzz warm reluct leav fact other want tabl well truli convinc locat best part citi sampl cream crop term tapa,good review,4,Spanish

The waiter was unfriendly and rude. When I began by asking him in Spanish if he speaks English (which other waiters in other restaurants made no fuss about, whether they spoke English or not), he looked at me as if I were some form of idiot who either didn’t know that I was in SPAIN or didn’t know that Spaniards speak a different language from English. He then informed me, in Spanish, of course, that he speaks Spanish (in a tone implying “what did you expect?”). The tone was insulting and utterly unnecessary. Despite the menu showing several half bottles of red wine, there were only two available. It’s not a good sign to have a misleadingly long wine list, and not have even the commonly purchased choices in stock. We did end up ordering a bottle and, I'll concede, it was outstanding! We had had delicious tomato salads in two other restaurants at our previous two dinners in Madrid, so we ordered the tomato salad, knowing that ripe, juicy, flavorful, and delicious tomatoes were available. We were served tomatoes that were the kind you get in mid-winter in a US supermarket — tough, unripe, and just plain flavorless. I ordered a veal shank, which was overcooked and floating in tepid bottled gravy, with lukewarm roasted potatoes. My wife ordered a ""prey"" of pork, which should have been slices of rare and tender roasted pork shoulder. It came out as thin, boneless, extremely tough slices of grilled pork with a very sweet sauce. They were at least rare, but the sauce was really unpleasant. Her potatoes were undercooked french fries. Also, my meal came out of the kitchen first and I had to flag another waiter (ours had disappeared) and a bus boy to finally get my wife’s meal delivered to our table. Casa Alberto seemed to us to sell the kind of food you might get in a museum cafeteria: OK food, but with pretensions. I’d be surprised if anything is prepared to order. I’d expect the kitchen to operate like a cafeteria kitchen. We saw literally only tourists in the restaurant — and it was packed to the rafters with people like us — which was not a surprise. I can’t imagine anyone from Madrid bothering to eat here.",2016-10-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or160-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_1304,0.068,0.867,0.065,0.3141,0.0108609385783298,0.5466407867494822,0.42877,2214,178,0.080397470641373,1,57,False,68,0.0721649484536082,0.1237113402061855,0.2061855670103092,0.0721649484536082,0.134020618556701,0.0412371134020618,0.0618556701030927,0.0515463917525773,0.1443298969072164,0.0927835051546391,394,242,4.621827411167513,0,0,dinner casa alberto describ best disappoint waiter unfriendli rude began ask spanish speak english waiter restaur made fuss whether spoke english look form idiot either know spain know spaniard speak differ languag english inform spanish cours speak spanish tone impli expect tone insult utterli unnecessari despit menu show sever half bottl red wine two avail good sign misleadingli long wine list even commonli purchas choic stock end order bottl conced outstand delici tomato salad two restaur previou two dinner madrid order tomato salad know ripe juici flavor delici tomato avail serv tomato kind get mid winter us supermarket tough unrip plain flavorless order veal shank overcook float tepid bottl gravi lukewarm roast potato wife order prey pork slice rare tender roast pork shoulder came thin boneless extrem tough slice grill pork sweet sauc least rare sauc realli unpleas potato undercook french fri also meal came kitchen first flag anoth waiter disappear bu boy final get wife meal deliv tabl casa alberto seem us sell kind food might get museum cafeteria ok food pretens surpris anyth prepar order expect kitchen oper like cafeteria kitchen saw liter tourist restaur pack rafter peopl like us surpris imagin anyon madrid bother eat,bad review,2,Spanish

Upon arrival I was not expecting as large of portions as we ended up with. I ordered a Beef Strip entree for €8.50 and ended up with 5 huge pieces of strip, and a half a plate of French fries, and almost couldn't finish the whole thing. Being one of the cheapest things on the menu, I assumed it would've been much smaller and was not prepared to take on the whole plate.

After checking into the hotel on Santa Ana Plaza I decided to take a walk and perhaps find a tapas restaurant that was still serving food this late at night. I stumbled upon this cafe which from the outside looked quite inviting. The waiter greeted me at the door and informed me that while the restaurant had stop serving food tapas at the bar was still available. I ordered a top sirloin in a blueberry sauce and a small beer. While waiting I was served a generous basket of delicious crusty rustica bread along with a plate of green olives in oil with a small fish which I assumed was an anchovy. The steak was maybe 4 oz and amazingly flavorful. It was seared and nearly raw in the middle but was so tender it reminded me of Ahi. I was very satisfied with the light meal and asked for the check which came out to a very reasonable 7.25 Euros. I had not yet changed any money so expected to pay by credit card. This Amex and Visa symbols were prominently displayed in the window outside so I was surprised when the waiter refused the card. Apparently there is a 10 Euro minimum. No problem, I normally would have asked for another beer or glass of wine but fighting jet lag I instead asked him for something ""light"" to eat in order to make up the difference. The waiter suggested a Russian salad which I wrongly assumed being a salad was light. To my disappointment I was served a large plate of what in America would be a very rich potato salad which was literally drowning in mayo! Although I later learned that this is a summer staple in Madrid I found it to be inedible and pushed it aside after only one or two spoonfuls. The waiter then brought the check with an additional charge of 8 Euros for the salad which even if I liked it was way overpriced. I was not pleased as an otherwise excellent first impression was marred by this incident. The waiter sort of apologized but didn't offer any restitution. I would have gladly settled the check up to 10 Euros and been content and then willing to give the place another chance later in the trip but for now I will pass.",2014-11-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or290-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_39955,0.045,0.851,0.104,0.9775,0.1581862563112563,0.5791471141471142,0.3272842105263157,2181,203,0.0930765703805593,1,25,False,80,0.0515463917525773,0.1752577319587628,0.2577319587628865,0.0721649484536082,0.134020618556701,0.0515463917525773,0.0309278350515463,0.0206185567010309,0.134020618556701,0.0721649484536082,410,234,4.321951219512195,0,0,arriv madrid late day gruel hour flight odyssey washington state check hotel santa ana plaza decid take walk perhap find tapa restaur still serv food late night stumbl upon cafe outsid look quit invit waiter greet door inform restaur stop serv food tapa bar still avail order top sirloin blueberri sauc small beer wait serv gener basket delici crusti rustica bread along plate green oliv oil small fish assum anchovi steak mayb oz amazingli flavor sear nearli raw middl tender remind ahi satisfi light meal ask check came reason euro yet chang money expect pay credit card amex visa symbol promin display window outsid surpris waiter refus card appar euro minimum problem normal would ask anoth beer glass wine fight jet lag instead ask someth light eat order make differ waiter suggest russian salad wrongli assum salad light disappoint serv larg plate america would rich potato salad liter drown mayo although later learn summer stapl madrid found ined push asid one two spoon waiter brought check addit charg euro salad even like way overpr pleas otherwis excel first impress mar incid waiter sort apolog offer restitut would gladli settl check euro content will give place anoth chanc later trip pass,bad review,2,Spanish

Our guide that morning had recommended it, along with a few other restaurants in Madrid. We did not have reservations, so we had to wait for awhile at the bar in the front of the restaurant, and we wanted to sit in the white tablecloth section rather than have tapas in the front section. We ordered a few beers, and the bartender gave us some small plates to nosh on, one of potatoes, the other fried pork rinds. It made the waiting more tolerable.

It's a proper Madrileno joint bursting with life and atmosphere in the heart of old Madrid. It's divided into bar at the front and slightly more formal dining area at the back. The walls are covered with photos and memorabilia, particularly bullfighting and Real Madrid. The place itself is quite old and features some interesting features which you can see from the website. The site also features a well documented history of Casa Alberto and the neighbourhood well worth reading. Casa Alberto has a large drinks selection. The food is good quality and reasonably priced. It is not Michelin so as long as you manage your expectations you will be happy. The menu is classic Madrid cooking but also features some dishes with a bit of a twist. We usually eat in the bar area. The staff are always friendly and the place stays open until late. It is emphatically not just for tourists, indeed one of the reasons I love Madrid is the energy of the Madrilenos and this bar seems to very popular with the locals. I would say that this is one of the best bars of its type in the city.

They also sell creative dessert style coffee drinks but we didn't sample during our visits. We found their version of the pastel de nata to be ok but not great. The cup included plenty of layers, each being crispy but the filling was too soft and loose once you bit through the surface. This resulted in the tart falling apart on us while trying to eat which wasn't great.  In the end, not a great pastel de nata so we'd likely give this one a pass next time around.

The establishment is quite small and split into two; a restaurant at the back and a lively tapas bar with a small number of tables at the front. For our visits we stuck to the tapas bar part. For starters, the atmosphere is very lively with tourists and locals in abundance - the best recommendation I have is to bag a spot at the bar or one of the small tables and do some people watching whilst you sip a cana. The food is good solid Spanish traditional fare - there is always a daily specials board which warrants a look - on one of our visits we had a very tasty squid with chick peas and black ink. In short, the food is unpretentious, tasty and interesting. In my opinion this is all enhanced by the service.

Their empanada tapas are very good. This place is a bit pricer than some other tapas bar, but if you order the right thing, it is more than worth it. We ordered the garlic lamb sweetbreads. They gave a very generous portion for 10.50 euros. It was amazing, so delicious. We also ordered the special, which was beef tongue at 7 euro. I lived in santa monica and currently in hawaii. There is no where in LA where you are going to get this kind of high end elevated food for these prices. This was the best beef tongue i have ever had. It was perfection. We went at a peak tapas dining time. Given that it was so crazy busy, it didnt actually take that long. The bartenders do a great job given the volume they have to deal with. Being American, I'm pretty impatient. The food does take a while, but remember you are in madrid in a tapas bar. The point is to have drinks and talk for a while. If you are hungry, you can order an already made tapas from the counter to have with your drinks like an appetizer until the larger cooked dishes come out. The larger dishes was well worth the wait.

Second zone, for dining, is a little restaurant. We had to book a table one day in advance. They serve typical Spanish food, which is probably not for me. I had pork with caramelized onions, sounds great, I know, but I could not manage to eat second bit after my first one. Pork had a strange strong taste, as it would be pork 100 years old. Actually no one of our company could finish that pork. Oxtail was intense, for men only, I would say. Not my taste, no no no. However, veal meatballs were great, my kids and I myself loved it! Meat was soft, in delicious tomato sauce. Mascarpone & berries dessert was really good one. So you see, mixed impressions!

Such amount of people could only mean one thing ""very good food"". Of course there were no tables free in the restaurant area or in the few table opposite the bar counter, so we decided to carry on with our search for the cous-cous place. This we found on the same street but the place was almost empty, only one table with two girls, which after seeing Casa Alberto ambience really turn us off. We decided to go back to Alberto's and have a drink and a tapa or two at the bar, even if it meant standing up. But luck was on our side and a table was freed just as we walked in, We had callous, rabo de toro, croquetas and empanadillas, all very Spanish and very, very tasty. I know the sound of those dishes might put non spaniards off, but I dare them to try it one day, they will not regret it if they like eating. However, for the less daring, this restaurant has a wide selection of dishes that are well presented and seemed delicious. I did not try the, but I saw how other diners enjoyed them. Same I have on my list for my next visit. The young boy that served us was most simpatic and his recommendations were well received, by us and by others. The barman would offer customers different tapas that kept coming out from the kitchen. It was a wonderful discovery and a very satisfying experience that we intend to repeat in our next visit to Madrid. By the way, the relation value for money was very good indeed.",2016-09-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697471-Reviews-or190-Casa_Alberto-Madrid.html,UID_39984,0.015,0.837,0.148,0.9936,0.1900277777777778,0.4601388888888888,0.4135,1602,152,0.0948813982521847,0,38,False,66,0.1272727272727272,0.1636363636363636,0.3090909090909091,0.109090909090909,0.1454545454545454,0.0363636363636363,0.0363636363636363,0.0,0.0545454545454545,0.0181818181818181,302,196,4.30794701986755,0,0,intent find restaur especialis cou cou howev pass casa alberto notic crowd compar restaur area amount peopl could mean one thing good food cours tabl free restaur area tabl opposit bar counter decid carri search cou cou place found street place almost empti one tabl two girl see casa alberto ambienc realli turn us decid go back alberto drink tapa two bar even meant stand luck side tabl freed walk callou rabo de toro croqueta empanadilla spanish tasti know sound dish might put non spaniard dare tri one day regret like eat howev less dare restaur wide select dish well present seem delici tri saw diner enjoy list next visit young boy serv us simpat recommend well receiv us other barman would offer custom differ tapa kept come kitchen wonder discoveri satisfi experi intend repeat next visit madrid way relat valu money good inde,good review,4,Spanish

Not that this place was particularly friendly either. Problem with solo travel can be wine - ie you're limited to a couple of wines by the glass - here there were several half bottles - hurrah! Anyway I enjoyed a standard fino, followed by a good Ribera del Duero.  place was rammed, certainly seems I waited at bar for say 15 mins before getting a table - they are very strict about who's first in the queue, again pleasant for a solo visitor not to be passed by for more profitable customers. I invited a couple waiting at the bar to share my table - turned out well, we didn't food share, but we did taste each others dishes. The black pudding with goats cheese was melt in the mouth (Spanish morcilla is nothing like our UK black pud), followed by delicous pork & beans. 1 fino, 1/2 bottle, a starter, a main €30.

If you like a very lively environment with 50 or so Spaniards (and some tourists) chatting away in a not so large room, creating a loud sound level, this is a place for you! The food in itself is plain but tasty and the waiter in charge (I think his name is Alex) has complete control over what is happening inside the restaurant - and he even manages to keep an eye on what´s happening outside (and waving at people in the street to come in). The price level is quite bearable, not to say very low.  So, if you like this kind of restaurants Taberna Alhambra is the place for you.

The grilled veggies were the highlight. The lamb was a literal leg of lamp. Certainly unsightly, though the boys said it was ""good,"" it was just that, no sides. The entire menu is a la carte.

It seemed quite different- much busier and more of a restaurant vibe rather than the tapas bar feel of before. We were glad to see it so busy and didn't mind waiting for a table. The food was good but I am now a vegetarian and there were only 3 dishes I could have- tomatoes, roasted peppers or roasted mixed veg. The tomatoes were described as a tomato salad, but in reality was a family sized plate of quartered tomatoes with only some dried oregano sprinkled on them- only €5 though! The roasted peppers and veg were really good. My husband had the gambas al ajillo and thoroughly enjoyed them! Our waiter was great and the atmosphere was busy, noisy and fun- perfect for a saturday night!

We stumbled across this establishment at around 1pm today and decided to give it a try after a cursory glance at its online reviews. The initially friendly waiter changed his tune as the restaurant started getting packed. We ordered the ""menu del dia"" and the food arrived promptly. I ordered the lobster and rice, however I was not offered a lobster cracker or a lobster fork like other neighbouring patrons. We tried to catch the waiter's attention but to no avail, until we finished our meals... We then realized that we were being ignored completely by the waiter, purposely? I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but after 20-30 minutes of waiting and trying a few times to request a modicum of service, it was obvious we were being ignored. My suspicions were confirmed when the waiter finally came and yelled rudely ""finished?"" and tried to rush us out by forcing the bill on us without even offering us coffee or dessert (included in our order). Our ordeal finally ended as we decided it was not worth causing a scene so we left without the coffee or dessert we paid for... I am very disappointed in our first meal in Madrid. I truly hope this is an isolated incident that does not represent the people of Madrid. This has been the worst dining experience of my life (and I've been to countless cities across the world).

We arrived at about 9:30 pm having previously reserved. The restaurant was full by 10:00. From the moment we arrived, the small front-of-house team were kept busy turning away a steady stream of people who wanted to eat here. I guess many of those trying to get a table had read or heard the reviews, raving about the incredible food they are turning out here for a very modest price. I suppose it's worth trying but If you want to avoid disappointment, be sure to book. The food was every bit as enjoyable as reviewers here and in the press have indicated. We had some of the crunchy rice with shredded and ground pork that others have already talked about. It is totally moreish. We also had the nems which were crunchy, succulent and served with the freshest lettuce and herbs to wrap them up in before dipping them into the highly comestible fish sauce based dip. The secreto (a cut of pork that is juicy and succulent) too is sublime. And the crispy, crunchy noodles leave you wanting more. Everything leaves you wanting more, although the food is deceptively filling. We had a bottle of Verdejo and the whole meal was around 60 euros. Outstanding value.  The restaurant is small - maybe 20 covers at most. It's simply decorated in neutral grey but, like Sudestada, the cutlery and linen is good quality and raises the tone of the place. Although we were sat within a meter of our neighbours, we didn't feel overheard here. You couldn't describe it as intimate, but it's a couple can easily enjoy a nice dinner together here. Service is helpful and attentive but not over-bearing. The staff may attempt to speak English (to a reasonable standard) even when it's not necessary. Normally, I find this slightly irritating but the staff are charming and it would be harsh to be irritated by their friendliness. Honestly, it would be harsh to find much to fault with anything here.
