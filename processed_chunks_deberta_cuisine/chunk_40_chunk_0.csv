It's actually not that hard to find, as it's behind the Mercado de San Miguel, a big, gaudy, glass and iron structure full of people and food markets. Get a taxi to take you to Mercado de San Miguel, or Plaza de San Miguel, and then walk around the Mercado until you find Emma's. There are actually two Emma's, I think run by the same lady, in close proximity to each other (the other is more of a bar, but also has food). We decide on this one. We had four tapas dishes, all with unique twists, nothing like the commodity tapas you get in the surrounding area. One was potatoes steamed and served ""Canary Island"" style, with two sauces for dipping; another, our favourite, was a lightly fried, crunchy and honey-sweetened then eggplant slices. A tapas portion of the lamb tagine was a big hit with my wife, and a selection of Iberian cold meats was authentic, flavourful, and delicious.

The codfish is the ""tapa"" that everyone comes to eat, and from early in the morning in the kitchen they strive to prepare it coated with a thin layer of flour and lightly fried in good olive oil. Without a single spine and always freshly made, if you eat it with a rod (glass of beer) or the traditional vermouth, it becomes a form of a delicious aperitif. Its very tight cost 5.50 euros for a glass of beer and two pieces of codfish (one it's never enough) make this a must for our visit to the old city center.",2013-04-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2457354-Reviews-or80-Casa_Revuelta-Madrid.html,UID_33444,0.013,0.88,0.108,0.9552,0.1923214285714285,0.4917857142857142,0.3869666666666666,829,72,0.0868516284680337,0,23,False,38,0.0833333333333333,0.1388888888888889,0.4166666666666667,0.0555555555555555,0.1388888888888889,0.0277777777777777,0.0,0.0277777777777777,0.1111111111111111,0.0,159,111,4.220125786163522,0,0,small old famili bar pretens heart madrid plaza mayor plaza de la villa alway full local day week despit modest appear small tabl wooden bench one best kept secret citi wonder tast tapa codfish codfish tapa everyon come eat earli morn kitchen strive prepar coat thin layer flour lightli fri good oliv oil without singl spine alway freshli made eat rod glass beer tradit vermouth becom form delici aperitif tight cost euro glass beer two piec codfish one never enough make must visit old citi center,good review,4,Spanish

Indeed, it is always packed with madrileños - even on a weekday just after 19.00 when it reopens for the evening shift - and yet there always seems to be standing room to enjoy a delicious chunk of salt cod fried lightly in batter. Salt is a misnomer as it is not at all salty after soaking in cold water for at least 24 hours or more ;-) The small glass of red wine (apparently from Valdepeñas) that people order with it is a pretty indifferent house wine. A caña of draught lager is probably a better bet. The bar service was fast, friendly and efficient. Our two large pieces of ´bacalao’, a wine and a beer came to 7.50 euro which is good value for a place which serves some of the best cod in Madrid.",2013-04-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2457354-Reviews-or80-Casa_Revuelta-Madrid.html,UID_2508,0.011,0.809,0.181,0.9817,0.2466269841269841,0.5654761904761905,0.3094599999999999,773,68,0.0879689521345407,0,19,False,31,0.1470588235294117,0.1764705882352941,0.2647058823529412,0.0294117647058823,0.1470588235294117,0.0294117647058823,0.0,0.0294117647058823,0.1764705882352941,0.0,149,107,4.194630872483222,0,0,small cramp unassum bar close plaza mayor inde alway pack madril os even weekday reopen even shift yet alway seem stand room enjoy delici chunk salt cod fri lightli batter salt misnom salti soak cold water least hour small glass red wine appar valdep peopl order pretti indiffer hous wine ca draught lager probabl better bet bar servic fast friendli effici two larg piec bacalao wine beer came euro good valu place serv best cod madrid,good review,4,Spanish

Well not much has changed apart from the prices. The decor, service and food is still the same - all very good. We ordered the lamb for our main course which was succulent and delicious and the house wine at under 10 euros for half a bottle was very good value. However, what was really disappointing is that they charged us 2.50 euros for 1 small packet of butter (which we asked for) on top of the 3.60 euros we paid for 2 small bread rolls and a few olives (which we did not order). Charging for the butter was exhorbitant and it has put me off going there again, as there are many excellent dining houses in Madrid and next time I am there I shall certainly give this restaurant a miss.",2015-04-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d896751-Reviews-or180-Posada_de_la_Villa-Madrid.html,UID_33490,0.038,0.818,0.144,0.9615,0.2574603174603174,0.4790608465608466,0.6634833333333333,837,79,0.094384707287933,0,17,False,45,0.1428571428571428,0.2,0.2857142857142857,0.0571428571428571,0.1714285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142857142857142,0.0285714285714285,162,111,4.172839506172839,0,0,ate night ago daughter last time ate restaur year ago husband realli impress well much chang apart price decor servic food still good order lamb main cours succul delici hous wine euro half bottl good valu howev realli disappoint charg us euro small packet butter ask top euro paid small bread roll oliv order charg butter exhorbit put go mani excel dine hous madrid next time shall certainli give restaur miss,bad review,2,Spanish

Despite being in a rather touristy and busy location, the waiters are super friendly and cheerful and even make an effort to understand foreign languages (rather than simply telling customers that they “don’t understand” like so many others in Madrid always do). Due to this and the cute décor, the atmosphere is super welcoming and makes for a great place to go for breakfast in the morning. As if that wasn’t enough, the prices are also really reasonable and there’s a pretty big range of things to choose from, both sweet and savory. Perhaps the best thing about this place, however, is that they even have a “vegan” breakfast on the menu for only 3 euros. Although the standard Spanish breakfast is already pretty much vegan (toasted bread with tomato paste and olive oil), La Rollerie takes it a step further and uses wholegrain vegan croissants to ensure that no animal products are used, hence making things even more interesting and original. Additionally, their tomato paste is orange in color and must therefore feature some other unique ingredients. Margarine and jam are also available as options to use on toast and therefore make this a place that is affordable and convenient for literally everyone.",2016-10-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8134432-Reviews-or120-La_Rollerie_Calle_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_456,0.036,0.718,0.246,0.997,0.2297297297297297,0.5968146718146717,0.2979142857142857,1426,100,0.0701262272089761,0,24,False,47,0.1025641025641025,0.1538461538461538,0.4615384615384615,0.1025641025641025,0.1282051282051282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0512820512820512,0.0,239,160,4.97071129707113,0,0,rolleri locat near plaza benavent never particularli impress nice set bore waiter even bore tea pastri super surpris outlet despit rather touristi busi locat waiter super friendli cheer even make effort understand foreign languag rather simpli tell custom understand like mani other madrid alway due cute cor atmospher super welcom make great place go breakfast morn enough price also realli reason pretti big rang thing choos sweet savori perhap best thing place howev even vegan breakfast menu euro although standard spanish breakfast alreadi pretti much vegan toast bread tomato past oliv oil la rolleri take step use wholegrain vegan croissant ensur anim product use henc make thing even interest origin addit tomato past orang color must therefor featur uniqu ingredi margarin jam also avail option use toast therefor make place afford conveni liter everyon,good review,4,Spanish

This rice dish is quite versatile as it can be filled with any number of tasty ingredients, like meat, seafood, and veggies. Every Spanish mother has their own recipe...you can try this excellent traditional mixed seafood paella in this restaurant.  I tried panelle at difference restaurants in Madrid, Barcelona and and Seville. And this restaurant definitely offers the best seafood paella. It's extremely fresh and perfectly cooked and the seafood still unbelievablely yummy after cooking paella. Especially the shrimp, it's super!

Which is mostly the reason why i gave this three star place a four star.  2. Friendly workers 3. Okay food but for the price i gotta say its crappy. I got yakisoba, wouldnt ever go back and get it though. It was just okay. And the sushi was okay i guess. 4. Hidden inside the mercado. You have to go in and go downstairs to find this place tucked away in between all the meat and fish vendors.  5. If you have a weak stomache maybe you should go find somewhere else that wouldnt have meat chopping scenes and fish smell. I didnt mind it if it meant for good food. Plus all the restaurants and cafes inside the mercado have the prettiest interiors and honestly it means that their ingredients are fresh from the markets right next to them.  I got a YAKISOBA noddle dish and a couple pieces of sushi. Unfortunately uni is only available in the winter so that wasnt available. The staff are very friendly. Don't be afraid to ask for the wifi password. They speak good English and don't wait for the check, because you go to the cashier to pay. Anyways I am sad to say that the food is not amazing.

Although it’s not super cheap, it’s still pretty affordable and definitely much better than in most places. Besides the delicious food and drinks, Yokaloka also happens to have helpful and efficient staff that actually makes an effort to smile and be polite towards their customers (even if they sometimes still look like they’d rather be doing something else). My only problem with this place, however, is its location. Although I’ve never been a fan of markets, I can tolerate pretty ones like San Anton, San Ildefonso, and others. The Mercado de Anton Martin, however, is far from being visually appealing. Since the restaurant is usually open when the market stalls are closed, it always feels like you’re sitting in some abandoned factory or warehouse with dirty floors.

She was on the verge of being orgiastic. I had the fried artichokes - paper thin slices of baby artichokes fried in olive oil that had the texture of potato chips but were pure artichoke flavor.

Sacha is not the easiest restaurant to find even with GPS as it is at the rear of where it should be and is hidden away in a corner when you do find the right side of the building. On entering everything looks great, small but cosy, busy and traditional. We had two fluent Spanish speakers in our party so there was no excuse for misinterpretation or confusion but that's what happened. We asked for several starters which were mysteriously unavailable and so asked for a selection that the waiter would recommend. The result was disappointing, yes the tomato bread is good but not €15 good. The anchovies were good not salty and the tortilla with chorizo was beautifully cooked but not memorable. For the mains we ordered the Gallo which was good but not great, the solomillo which was excellent and the lamb with marrow which was very good indeed, the lasagne was extremely average. Desserts were decent but we felt rushed throughout. Everyone was happy with the wines selected by the waiter and it was noted that they didn't push us to choose expensively. Good but not great.

It has the reputation of being a place where many chefs from other restaurants dine (according to my cab driver and a NYT article). The address of the restaurant is the front of the building.

This is a traditional Tapas bar with a VERY good selection of wines and good quality food. Before I go on I want to defend the place…. TatianaC1943….your barking mad, no normal person would sit in a bar for 2 hours and not mention that your food hadn’t arrived, did you only have one drink in that time? Even a non-drinker would have at least a glass of water after 30 minutes of waiting, were you even in the right place in the first place? Not all the food is from cans, what I do know that is from a can (because they sell it as well, in cans strangely) are snails, olives, anchovies. You say that you paid 50 Euros and only had a couple of meals? I think you had been drinking a bit more than your letting on, ensaladas are on average 12 euros, the pate is average 4 euros ! We first visited early on a Friday evening , nice and busy with a great mix of people, locals and tourists alike. We sat at one of the higher bar tables, so we could get some people watching in, also it closer to the wine rack. Fantastic range of wines and in my opinion the prices were amazing red/white from 2.50 – 3.90 euros for a glass, if you find one you really like get a bottle from the shelf, better than getting a full bottle and finding you don’t like it. We saw that there were some great cheeses and meats in the chiller as you go in, you can pick your own or just let them make one up for you, either way you won’t be disappointed. The staff were very attentive and gave some great advice on the wines and different foods. Second visit was a late Sunday afternoon (just be aware that they close about 4:30 ish) nice chatting with locals and getting more tips! The only thing we had to remind the waiters about was the fact that they had not charged us enough for our drinks!

Even the local pizza delivery man wasn't too sure of the location and his shop was less than 50 meters away! We arrived about 9pm on a Monday night and were quite lucky to get a table for two, always a good sign.  I don't speak Spanish but am fairly well versed in menu Spanish, however this menu is very colloquial and doesn't really describe the ingredients in most of the dishes, so an English menu would leave English speakers none the wiser. Even Spaniards need to ask about the dishes. Luckily my friend is a native speaker so could ask about the menu. English seemed limited amongst most of the staff, however I think the sommelier was reasonably fluent, very helpful and a real delight. We started with some nice Manzanilla and salted almonds to whet the appetite, followed by a very decent Cava, Gramona, with the first two courses; Falsa Lasana, very fine pasta sheets filled with king crab and tomato, topped with sea urchin, totally divine and Pincho Rape Langostinos, rape and langoustines, simply prepared with some Romanesco sauce served on the side. Next we had a bottle of Muga Selection Especial 2011, (pre-opened, tasted and left to breath for the hour or so of our first courses) with the Villagodio Tuetano; beef (deboned cote de boeuf, I think) cooked to perfection and served with bone marrow gravy and some potato, a really great pairing.  Finally I had an amazing cheese plate with a selection of Sherries, Amontillado, Oloroso and Palo Cortado. We left the restaurant close to midnight, full and exceedingly happy, definitely a meal to remember. The bill came to about 110 euro's per person for 4 courses, Cava, Rioja, no fewer than 4 types of Sherry and a glass of Port. I am marking this mid-ranged as I have paid significantly more for a lot less; however while not quite Michelin star category quality wise I think it does qualify as fine dining. I have read some mixed reviews about this place and while I can sympathise with tourists who get taken out of their comfort zone here, I think that if you go with a versatile palate, an open mind and a willingness to communicate, you will be extremely well rewarded.

We started with home smoked sardines, followed by omlette with truffle shavings, then a bone marrow dish with steak filets as a side and to finish a super yummy chocolate dessert. The wine pairing as chosen by the owner was perfect with the food. The owner himself is quite a character, he's very animated and pasionate about the food he cooks - his waiting staff are much more subdued. The owner does a morning radio show so it was very interesting to finally see his face after hearing his voice and he certainly lived up to his reputation.  Note that the place is very Spanish, and definitely not in the jamon and paella kind of way, so if you don't speak any Spanish, you might struggle ordering so make sure you have a dictionary app on you're phone!

Perfect location, great and modern space with original design, very nice selection of wines, the freshest seafood ever (and trust me we are very fastidious eaters), decent prices and very thoughtful and welcoming personnel. We have celebrated the birthday of our family member there and not for a second have I regretted choosing this place. The staff have offered us very personalized service: they let me bring balloons and the cake and had reserved the best table in the whole restaurant for us. More than that, they kept well all the surprises and helped to make the day even more special. Not to mention the finale when the celebratory bottle of champagne was popped for the birthday boy and was on the house. Recommend it for anyone looking for an aperitif, lunch or dinner! Their kitchen is open whole day (which is rare in Madrid). It is a truly amazing new baby of Grupo Oter which is so known for its quality.

(One of the most interesting things about eating here is taking a second glance and realizing that the towers somehow anchor a thriving upper middle class neighborhood. This is something that could never exist in the states and thus as culturally strange as the Baroque neighborhoods in Central Madrid that predate our country.) The food is uniformly good and, in summer, they basically shut the inside restaurant and serve everyone at an outdoor space between two of the towers. This outside eatery is lovely to look at but Americans who dislike summer heat may be unhappy that there's no option to eat inside. One tip on finding the place: It doesn't face onto the main street.

Our young waiter was surly and uninterested in his job. Later we had another waiter (the one with the beard) and he was like a breath of fresh air. But unfortunately he served us just once and then we were back to Mr Surly. One of our dishes never arrived but it was listed in our bill. When I brought it to the attention of the surly guy, he looked at it, scowled, said nothing, made a new bill, never spoke a word. We were seated right up against a series of tables joined together and occupied by a guide and about 12 tourists from the U.S. The noise was incredible. The guide was doing his bit, shouting at the top of his voice information about the food and wines. Shouting to be heard, because half of the group were paying no attention to him but shouting to each other. It was like being in a bad movie. After some time the tourist group left and we had a few minutes of blessed relief before another group of estadounidenses arrived with their guide and went to the same table as their predecessors. More mayhem. Clearly this place is on a list that local guides have, of places in Madrid to bring their tourists. The place is so full that the owners don't need to concern themselves with good food or good service.

I guess part of the problem was we didn't understand what we were ordering. The bone marrow with a side of steak was good. That dish was highly recommended in the reviews. They were out of sea urchin which is what I wanted, and was recommend cod with potatoes. It was blah. White sauce and 3 boiled potatoes. Can't say much for the rest of the mains.  Try the almond cake desert. That seems to be a winner. Many people ordered it but I didn't try it.

To easily find it, look for Rubaiyat’s terrace and it is next to it. Very nice garden to eat, with trees and plenty of space between tables.  The food was quite good. Classic Mediterranean cooking with some innovative details. We loved the “sardinas” and the steak tartar. We ordered teh tartar lightly spiced, and it was a little more than expected, but still OK. The “raya” was quite good and fresh, but not very tasty (probably that kind of fish isn’t tasty in general). We did not order dessert and the total price was 82€ for two people (we were not so hungry, so usually it will be more than that). The service was correct, very polite, but some smiles won’t do any harm. In particular, we were surprised by the disgust face of the waitress when we told her we did not want any dessert. No big deal, anyway.

If you like food, and you are not picky, I'd definitely recommend you ask for the cook to choose your menu, and let yourself try different dishes. You will be surprised. Not easy to find, impossible to forget. I am in Love with this cook. He served our table personally, he liked very much our baby which they were very nice to allow us to bring along.

The gentlemen running the place (could they be father and son?) were warm, friendly and very accommodating. Madrid is a big city and we've found many of the local restaurant employees to be indifferent to our presence if not simply rude. There have been a few notable exceptions and Gonzalez was a pleasant one.  We popped in for a late lunch and discovered they have an exhaustive wine selection. Probably 2 dozen wines offered by the glass. We speak very little Spanish but they were very accommodating and understanding. Both gentlemen we dealt with spoke a little English which was helpful.

What made me stay, was their extensive selection of wines per glass.  Actually, most of the usual tourist places in Madrid have 30-40 different wines per bottle, but when travelling alone, and for work, I normally do not need a whole bottle of wine for lunch, all for myself. I would much prefer to taste one or two glasses of LOCAL wine, rather than standard industrial trash. But these places only keep 3-4 open bottles, always EXACTLY the same, Rioja, Ribera, whatever, BORING.  This place was different, I started TALKING to the owner and bartenders (for me, as an Italophone, that was easy), and followed their advice. If you are a tourist, they may be disposed to treat you as a tourist. But when they recognise you are a traveller, they reciprocate. And they may suggest you GREAT wines, GREAT cheeses, and simple, local, tasty food. In this place, and a similar bottega in Granada (La Brujidera), in a few days I've discovered more local flavours, than in preceding years. The quality/price ratio is AMAZINGLY high. You pay 2 euro for a glass of wine, of the same stature as the one for which you pay 5-6 euro in Siena, and a complete meal is 12-15 euro.",2013-04-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1178110-Reviews-or160-Casa_Gonzalez-Madrid.html,UID_33619,0.057,0.856,0.087,0.918,0.1022043010752688,0.4321658986175116,0.471675,1319,106,0.0803639120545868,0,54,False,46,0.1081081081081081,0.1081081081081081,0.2702702702702703,0.054054054054054,0.2432432432432432,0.027027027027027,0.054054054054054,0.027027027027027,0.054054054054054,0.054054054054054,235,166,4.608510638297872,0,0,first step insid quit accident like display chees place busi free tabl one seat desk made stay extens select wine per glass actual usual tourist place madrid differ wine per bottl travel alon work normal need whole bottl wine lunch would much prefer tast one two glass local wine rather standard industri trash place keep open bottl alway exactli rioja ribera whatev bore place differ start talk owner bartend italophon easi follow advic tourist may dispos treat tourist recognis travel reciproc may suggest great wine great chees simpl local tasti food place similar bottega granada la brujidera day discov local flavour preced year qualiti price ratio amazingli high pay euro glass wine statur one pay euro siena complet meal euro,good review,4,Spanish

It's a tapas bar disguised as a delicatessen / wine store founded in 1931.

Every single product is fresh, delicious. You can order at least 20 different wines by the glass, and the bottles are quite fairly priced as well. And they offer toasts of every single thing they have in store. Beware: no salads, no meats, no fish. Only toasts with a huge variety of cheese, cold cuts and stuff like that on top.

The restaurant is located in the heart of Madrid and is held on two floors in an typical Spanish style. The restaurant is very famous for it's fish food and that is what you get there.

It was amazing! We went back Christmas Eve and were disappointed. We received a warm welcome and champagne while we waited for our table.

The last item was veal stuffed with sweetbreads. I was looking forward to that and had been saving room to enjoy it and the veal was tough and lacked flavor.  The service impersonal and rushed.

It was the perfect place to spend a leisurely evening with a luscious Albariño wine and a copious menu to choose from, including special tasting menus which a group of young international professionals at the nearby table were experiencing.  The wait staff was particularly exceptional in not hovering over and asking if all was ok. They know when guests are enjoying the atmosphere and food and do not want to be bothered with interruptions. They also know when it is appropriate to approach a table. For us, a hefty plate of pimientos de padrón (small green peppers with the occasional hot one) was followed by the ubiquitous paella which we seemed to be in the mood for, in spite of all the many items on the menu that also got our attention and we wanted to try, but will save for another time. The abundance of food, all rich and flavorful was too much to eat, but dessert was not to be missed.

The owner and staff warmed up to us after my feeble attempts to speak Spanish, but we were understood more than enough! Of course, the meal starts with complementary olives, bread and pate. My wife had onion soup to start. Quite different than the French onion soup we eat in the States, a bit creamier, but nice. I had the 6 type salad, which included oranges, apples and greens. For main courses, we had a seafood mix in broth and grilled calamari, which was excellent. The Spanish white and red wines by the glass were very good. We were so full we couldn't order desert, but they brought us small tastes on the house and then shots of a sweet after dinner drunk. We were chatting with some other Americans at the next table (from Miami who spoke Spanish), sharing stories and tucking it up with the owners and waitstaff. Good food and a great atmosphere.

We came at 7pm, made a reservation after enjoying lunch at this place yesterday. Thank you, Xavier for not forgetting to mention in the reservation, that it was my birthday tonight ( we learnt, that the stuff was aware of it after 9pm). Our waitress, ( who didn’t speak a word of English) served us t two cold white buns, I asked to replace with warm and fresh and rye ( we tasted them at lunch) and she reluctantly did. Beware! They charge you for bread( as in many Spanish restaurants). Then she brought my husband steamed ( not fried) clams. The octopus( which we loved at lunch) was barely warm and mashed potatoes were literally floating in oil.. And still we managed to stay in good mood. We ordered dessert around 8.20, we asked the waitress twice- she was answering in Spanish, finally at 9 we cancelled coffee and dessert and this is when another waiter ( male ) appeared with this dessert with a candle for me! Telling me- I am sorry and no charge for dessert! Does he think, that out festive mood is worth a couple of euros and nearly an hour wait?! Bottom line- very poorly and unprofessionally organized service in the evening and food awaits too long to be served. And lastly- we are staying in Hotel Villa Real for about 10 days and visited practically all local restaurants. It was hard to choose one for my birthday. It was a definitely a wrong choice. Wouldn’t recommend for dinner or any kind of celebration.

There’s no dedicated waiter for each table, just whoever is passing by attends to you, and we seemed to have been completely forgotten for most of the night. We’d bought a bottle of wine and they only did small pours, so we were constantly waiting for refills of wine as well as water. The female waitress seemed very unfriendly, she didn’t seem happy to be waiting on tourists even though we’d dressed up and intended to have a lovely evening. It was also not particularly busy when we got there at 8:30pm so service should have been much better.  We ordered the jamon salad with sun dried tomatoes which was lovely. We then shared the chicken and beef paella which was mostly lovely, though the beef was very over cooked and we left some in the pan. Rice and chicken were lovely.  Overall just disappointing.

Opt for an early dinner and stay within dining area instead of tapas bar at the front, both areas are great with dining area having a fine dining decor. Service is helpful, with no problem conversing in English from one of the waitress while the other not as fluent but made up for her eagerness to serve us well! Food is immaculate, house white wine is slight sweet, fragrant and matched well with the baked freshly caught seabass in salt crust, serving for two but good enough for three, meat is soft, tender and melts in your mouth! Grilled red prawns are soft, tender but oh so sweet in favour which is contrary to the usual textural style of ones we used to have. Even the shrimp head cream is also so sweet . The octopus is well prepared as well, with such tender chewiness, gotta try it to believe, another standout! Price is on pricey side but well worth it for the whole experience!

Dishes were flavorful, clean, and high quality. The tapas portions were so large, I thought we accidentally ordered full portions! After having a mediocre meal at the popular Taberna del Chato, I didn't expect much at Emma's. But I was really impressed with almost everything.  The gazpacho was amazing! A must order. 5/5 The hamburger with caramelized onions was also delicious. 5/5 The morcilla in a pastry puff was also good. The bed of sautéed peppers was the star though. 4/5 The tagine of lamb was authentic, flavorful, and delicious. 5/5 The potatoes look simple but the 2 sauces are amazing! 5/5 The oxtail wasn't great but not bad either. It's a little heavy and lacking something. 2/5 The tuna tasted way too fishy.

The staples of any rodízio are the rice, the beans and the meat. All three were superb. I’m used to rodízios but this place really stands out for quality. The tastiest black beans I’ve had in recent times. And the meat was plenty, it was juicy and I liked the fact that they will ensure you get the cuts you want rather than try to stuff you with less popular cuts - a tactic employed by many restaurants that follow the “Rodízio” model. The only thing one could point out is that the rest of the buffet isn’t particularly varied vis-à-vis other similar restaurants. I for one value quality over quantity (and variety) so this didn’t bother me at all.

If ordering red wine remember to ask for a crianza. There is also a good selection of sherries.  What I like about this place is that you go in for a small beer and see something on the counter like razor clams and end up staying there hours going through all the tapas.

Given it looked quite interesting and was close to where we where staying the choice was made to come back for dinner. So very glad we did. Twice actually.  Keep in mind this place gets very busy with locals. Lots of wine, lots of talking. This is a little noisy place at times but a lot of fun. You do not at all feel like you stepped into a tourist trap!  Service both times was good, very helpful staff. They are very busy as well so expect a little bit of a wait as they get around to your requests. It is not bad, just busy.  The menu here is quite large not that we tried everything but all the dishes we had where very good.  Here is what we had over the two times we went for dinner: * Snails in sauce * Pigs cheek in sauce * Roasted piquillo red peppers with pine nuts * A plate of Spanish sausage * A plat of mixed cheese (5 types) (got the waiter to pick) * Gazpacho * A plate of Jamon ham Each time we went we got Jamon ham and some mixed cheeses. This place has so many Spanish cheeses that you can try. The waiter asked for our taste preference for the cheese to go into the mixed selection. We let him pick I was happy to try new cheeses.  One of the cheese plates also came with a fruit paste.  Over all the cheeses where quite nice I lost track of what each one was. The Jamon ham was also very good and quite a decent serve. Goes well with the fresh bread they have! The snail dish was quite good. Very nice taste, it seems to be based off tomato and stewed for a long time. Some bread dipped into the sauce also went down very well.  The snails where well cleaned and had very nice fresh taste. The pigs cheek we had was amazingly tender and had such a nice flavor. I am unsure of what the sauce was, I’ve not had something like it before. It however matched the pig cheek very well. The roasted piquillo red peppers with pine nuts was an interesting salad. It was dressed with a thicker vinaigrette which was a little sweet but not over the top by any means the vinegar’s amazing taste still came though.  The peppers where nicely roasted. Retaining the sweetness of the pepper.  This was well offset by the crisp taste of the salad leaves. Loved the dressing on this salad. A plate of Spanish sausages was also good, not much to say about this really. It is good sausage. I’d like to try some of the different sausages next time.  The Gazpacho also went down well. Nice flavors rich tomato taste. Though nothing amazing compared to a few others I have had else where in Spain.  Each time we asked the waiter to pick us some red wine. He selected some good ones, let us taste first. We ended up buying an extra bottle to take home with us one night. If I am back in Madrid, I will be back into this place to try more of the menu.",2016-12-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1178110-Reviews-or90-Casa_Gonzalez-Madrid.html,UID_33773,0.04,0.759,0.201,0.9989,0.2669998640650814,0.4657134491917101,0.3467651162790698,2838,258,0.0909090909090909,2,65,False,153,0.1875,0.125,0.25,0.0982142857142857,0.1339285714285714,0.0178571428571428,0.0178571428571428,0.0178571428571428,0.0982142857142857,0.0535714285714285,554,275,4.1046931407942235,0,0,stumbl across place pure accid late afternoon close given look quit interest close stay choic made come back dinner glad twice actual keep mind place get busi local lot wine lot talk littl noisi place time lot fun feel like step tourist trap servic time good help staff busi well expect littl bit wait get around request bad busi menu quit larg tri everyth dish good two time went dinner snail sauc pig cheek sauc roast piquillo red pepper pine nut plate spanish sausag plat mix chees type got waiter pick gazpacho plate jamon ham time went got jamon ham mix chees place mani spanish chees tri waiter ask tast prefer chees go mix select let pick happi tri new chees one chees plate also came fruit past chees quit nice lost track one jamon ham also good quit decent serv goe well fresh bread snail dish quit good nice tast seem base tomato stew long time bread dip sauc also went well snail well clean nice fresh tast pig cheek amazingli tender nice flavor unsur sauc someth like howev match pig cheek well roast piquillo red pepper pine nut interest salad dress thicker vinaigrett littl sweet top mean vinegar amaz tast still came though pepper nice roast retain sweet pepper well offset crisp tast salad leav love dress salad plate spanish sausag also good much say realli good sausag like tri differ sausag next time gazpacho also went well nice flavor rich tomato tast though noth amaz compar other els spain time ask waiter pick us red wine select good one let us tast first end buy extra bottl take home us one night back madrid back place tri menu,good review,4,Spanish

Within 30 min of our concierge calling ahead on a busy Friday evening were seated at reserved table in the window and then served within seconds. Our selections (Goat cheese and anchovy salad on a bed of rocket, warm tuna salad with peppers, minced cod, a selection of 5 local cheeses) was perfectly complimented by an affordable sampling of Rioja reds. Each dish was presented with evident pride and a flourish. Other than a modest delay for the check (....patience is a traveler's most important virtue) it was a quite memorable and gastronomically memorable Madrid experience.

There are a couple of tables in the window and a couple of ""gueridons"" with high stools alongside the counter. The walls are covered in shelves bearing countless bottles of different Spanish wines. Further back there is a small bar and behind that more tables. The waiters, dressed in black and white, look very smart and professional. Several sported handsome black beards. We visited twice; the first time in the evening for supper and the second time for a late Sunday lunch. There were lots of customers, especially in the evening, but on both occasions the waiters found us somewhere to sit. Glasses of wine,(125 mls), poured at the table, cost between about E2,50 and E4.00. There is a huge choice. Food includes tostas (basically open toasted sandwiches), plates of meats and cheeses, and a variety of hot dishes, e.g. piquillo peppers stuffed with cod and prawns served in a rich tomato sauce. The atmosphere is lively and convivial. Although this tapas bar is clearly popular with locals we did not feel out of place and felt very welcome, especially when we visited for the second time and probably looked familiar.

This place was recommended to our friends by a local person who was a friend of one of their children. It is located in central Madrid. We made reservations ahead of time but we really didn't have to at the time we requested. Spanish people eat at much later times than Americans. Our reservation was for 7:00 PM. We were the first people there.  We had requested a certain table which we got and the owner was very accommodating. We do speak some Spanish but they do have servers who speak basic English.

There were people from Andalucía in the bar who were enjoying themselves and, in true Andalucía fashion, began to clap and sing their bulerías and Sevillanas. The bar is adorned with feria posters and posters of Jerez, the birthplace of flamenco. The owner quickly came over, told them to stop and threatened to call the police if they didn’t stop singing. Such clearly shallow and racist behavior is just divisive and puts a dark smudge on this place for me. We left in protest, wishing we could have enjoyed our oloroso with authentic music and jubilation from the native crowd. I don’t think we’ll be back.

I’ve been to them all and they each had their uniqueness.  It’s a great layout and was looking forward to discovering a new restaurant especially blocks from home.  The team prides itself on being dining experts having worked in some the finest restaurants in Spain and even a 2 Michelin Star restaurant.  What a huge disappointment despite their experience and being in a prime location. In a well heeled neighborhood, with lots of competition, you would expect good service, quality and atmosphere.  On all three, they scored 0.  Chilly reception coupled with poor service at the bar. It seemed we were more an inconvenience than potential repeat customer. If they continue treating its customers like this, just like it’s predecessors, I don’t expect Santerra lasting much longer.  The deathly atmosphere and atrocious service was enough for us to walk our after a few minutes. I couldn’t finish my beverage quick enough. Didn’t want to waste more time and money.

The staff were friendly and guided us through the menu. At a start the have us a menu in English, but when we were ready to order they told us the menu was dated and gave us the new menu in Spanish. Unfortunately were there several of the dishes we wanted to order no longer on the menu. I was quite disappointed.  The food was good and we liked it. But, I think they easily could have stepped up a level. For instance did we get exactly the same sauces to the empanada and the triradito. Which is quite strange since the empanada is meat, while the tiradito is raw fish marinated in citrus. We also had a few nigiri, with delicious tuna belly. The rice did however not meet the standard. Understand me correct: it was good, but we expected more from this place.  We shared 7 dishes and order a bottle of wine, two cocktails and two coffee for just above 110 Euro. I think it is good value for the money A good measurement for a restaurant is how likely it is that I would recommend this to friends. I think I wouldn’t mention Chow Chow if some one asks me about restaurants in Madrid. In case someone asked me about it, I would say it is a nice place with good food.

Simple snacks are available - do not miss the salty chess with the sherry!  And that’s it - different lovely sherries, from light manzanilla on up to heavier oloroso, plus simple snacks. Perfect for pre- or post-lunch or -dinner.  A bar with at least 90 years of history - a time capsule still similar to what Hemingway would have experienced when he helped plot revolution back in the day. (And the “no photos!” rule on the wall from then still applies, so be warned not to take that irresistible selfie in here.)  Do read up online on the story of what a venencia actually is, and how it is used in sherry making and tasting: there’s one on the wall behind the bar!  This place is a treat!

The hot buffet also had a large choice of dishes to choice from and was equally as impressive as the meat choice.  The extensive drinks menu left us struggling as to what to order but with expert advice from one of the friendly owners the decision was made and the most delightful Strawberry Caipirinha was served up and tasted amazing.

The salad bar and hot buffet is to die for with a large and delicate variety of vegetables and salads that will contemplate the amazing meats served from the barbecue. Great customer service that will make me keep coming back. Well done Vila Brasil, thank you so much for making my holiday extra special and for sure I will be back soon.

Dairo, the manager of “Flavia,” is one such individual. When we arrived at his restaurant for dinner, upon hearing that my husband had allergies (nuts & fish), he introduced himself, presented us with several alternative menus and spent considerable time discussing different options for my husband, all the time patient and with a big smile on his face. In addition, later in the evening when he found out that it was my birthday coming up, he surprised me with a special yummy dessert (on the house!), with all the staff singing “Happy Birthday!” Oh, and did I mention that this was one of the best meals I ever had? What more can you ask for? Please visit Dairo at Flavia restaurant in Madrid-you won’t be sorry!

We were greeted by an arrogant person who seemed to be the manager. Although we had a reservation, he made us feel as if he is doing us a favor allowing us to eat at his restaurant. We wanted to order drinks, but their menus do not contain any information about soft drinks and beer so we asked the waitress to direct us to the correct information but she confirmed that the restaurant does not indicate or note the drink prices or which types of beer they have. I am not aware whether this is a legal practice to hide prices but it is definitely a practice that leaves the guests with a bad feeling. We asked her for information and she gave us wrong information. We ordered drinks and received the smallest soft drink bottles we ever had. Later they tried to charge us for drinks we did not order. Can you imagine that a small bottle of water costs 3.85 Euros? The came to the table offering us some what seemed to be cooked ham. We declined. Later we read other reviews claiming it is part of their practice to later charge extra money for that from the guest who never ordered it. There was a basket of dry bread on the table. We asked the waitress who answered ""this bread is from today"". It was dry and bad tasting. They did not provide us with fresh bread as in all other restaurants we visited especially those claiming to provide top quality food. The food is expensive and totally of poor quality compared to the prices you have to pay. 19.5 Euros for seafood pasta. In the menu it states that there is squid and lobster as well as clams, prawns and mussel. The waitress informed us the dish is served with the seafood peeled and ready to eat (as is customary). We received noodle soft overcooked pasta. We found 1 clam and zero lobster and zero squid. We did find some mussels and shrimps or prawns. We asked the waitress about it. She said the squid and lobster are not detected because they dissolved, according to her. We did not accept her explanation and asked her to check with the chef whether we received squid and lobster. Then another guy waiter who was very rude and aggressive approached us and stated that it is our fault we did not receive lobster because according to him we demanded peeled see food and lobster is neve peeled so we were not provided any lobster. I told him that we have had lobster before many times and we always received the lobster tail peeled and there is no issue to that, and furthermore they never advised us that they would not put any lobster as it is stated in the menu. Furthermore, he claimed we received squid but we do not know the difference between squid and pasta, and according to him we mistook the pasta which was actually squid. I have never heard such a ridiculous claim in my life and felt conned and cheated. In 30 years of eating seafood I have never heard that pasta is squid or can be confused with squid. Based on the interaction with the staff, It is clear to us that the restaurant intentionally cheated us and charged us for overcooked pasta without lobster and squid and hardly any clams.  The salad was also expensive, bland, unseasoned or under-seasoned and we paid around 14 Euros for it. They never apologized for there terrible performance and even proceeded to overcharge us in the bill possibly assuming we are dumb tourists that would be unaware of their ""mistakes"" in overcharging. Upon our insistence, they reluctantly proceeded to remove the overcharges from the bill. What a terrible experience, bad service bad food high prices and shady practices. I would never return to this terrible restaurant who does not appreciate its guests and tries to trick them. Horrendous place expensive and bad service and worse food.",2019-08-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7895442-Reviews-or20-Flavia_Restaurant_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_33875,0.15,0.818,0.032,-0.9984,-0.1991346153846153,0.5599999999999999,0.3280236842105263,3812,335,0.0878803777544596,0,60,False,133,0.0428571428571428,0.0785714285714285,0.2214285714285714,0.0214285714285714,0.1142857142857142,0.1,0.0785714285714285,0.1,0.1571428571428571,0.0857142857142857,689,320,4.532656023222061,0,0,worst restaur experi madrid first time felt hustl trick greet arrog person seem manag although reserv made us feel us favor allow us eat restaur want order drink menu contain inform soft drink beer ask waitress direct us correct inform confirm restaur indic note drink price type beer awar whether legal practic hide price definit practic leav guest bad feel ask inform gave us wrong inform order drink receiv smallest soft drink bottl ever later tri charg us drink order imagin small bottl water cost euro came tabl offer us seem cook ham declin later read review claim part practic later charg extra money guest never order basket dri bread tabl ask waitress answer bread today dri bad tast provid us fresh bread restaur visit especi claim provid top qualiti food food expens total poor qualiti compar price pay euro seafood pasta menu state squid lobster well clam prawn mussel waitress inform us dish serv seafood peel readi eat customari receiv noodl soft overcook pasta found clam zero lobster zero squid find mussel shrimp prawn ask waitress said squid lobster detect dissolv accord accept explan ask check chef whether receiv squid lobster anoth guy waiter rude aggress approach us state fault receiv lobster accord demand peel see food lobster neve peel provid lobster told lobster mani time alway receiv lobster tail peel issu furthermor never advis us would put lobster state menu furthermor claim receiv squid know differ squid pasta accord mistook pasta actual squid never heard ridicul claim life felt con cheat year eat seafood never heard pasta squid confus squid base interact staff clear us restaur intent cheat us charg us overcook pasta without lobster squid hardli clam salad also expens bland unseason season paid around euro never apolog terribl perform even proceed overcharg us bill possibl assum dumb tourist would unawar mistak overcharg upon insist reluctantli proceed remov overcharg bill terribl experi bad servic bad food high price shadi practic would never return terribl restaur appreci guest tri trick horrend place expens bad servic wors food,very bad review,1,Spanish

It turns out that Flavia Restaurant & Bar has excellent Italian cuisine, in a nice and cozy atmosphere and in a location just a few steps away from Calle de Serrano, the equivalent in Madrid to New York's Fifth Avenue. The restaurant has a menu that caters to all kinds of diners, from carnivores to vegetarian, to gluten free to just mention a few. We went for dinner and had made a reservation (it was a Friday evening!) and the place was packed. Service was attentive, polite and efficient. We all ordered dishes to share and the waiter organized that the kitchen divided each shared plate into two portions on separate dishes, thus avoiding the usual complication of trying to divide the dishes at the table. The menu is filled with all kinds of delicious dishes, we decided to try some pasta and pizzas to share. We first ate our pizzas and then the waiter brought the pasta dishes piping hot from the kitchen. The wine list was very good having a good sellection of Italian and other wines. We selected a red primitivo (from Puglia region) that was superb.

I had heard about this place even before that and thought it sounded interesting, but now as a sherry lover, and despite only spending one day in Madrid as a stop off, this was high on my places to visit. Lets get one thing straight, if you do not like sherry, dusty old shelves, old world charm and no nonsense service, then this probably is not the place for you. There are plenty of modern bars selling cocktails, fancy wines and exciting food, but this is NOT one of them. It is also not somewhere to go for a meal as tapas is all there is, and only a small selection at that.  Now, if you love sherry, or are open to giving it a fair chance, and want to drink it in unpretentious surroundings, with a small, but perfectly suited selection of tapas, then you really do have to check this place out. So you cant take photos, leave a tip or stroke the cat....so what!! If updating your facebook status with a photo is priority for you, best stay away. I for one can not wait to go back, and have already recommended it to anyone who will listen.

Unlike the output of modern interior designers of bars and restaurants who strive for a ""distressed"" look, this interior is genuinely distressed. The only comparator I can think of is Gordon's wine bar in Villiers Street, London: decades of tobacco stains on the walls and ceilings, plain wooden floor, crumbling plaster, rickety chairs to sit on, and all orders placed at the counter. We visited twice during our stay: once at 10pm after dinner when it was very quiet; once before dinner around 7pm when the place was heaving. You have to push your way through to find a chair or a table in the rear room and then push your way back to the bar to order your sherry ----which is the main point in coming. A very good range of excellent sherries drawn from large wooden casks (each having mysterious chalk markings ). We has mostly manzanilla,fino and oloroso---all of which were excellent and cheaper than other bars we visited. Nutrition is provided by a plate of olives. Strongly recommended provided you dont mind a Madrid rugby scrum: otherwise go at 10pm. Quite properly, the management do not allow photographs inside.

If you want great Italian food with amazing service, come here! Our server John Paul and Manager Dayro took excellent care of us! My husband and I were in Madrid for a portion of our honeymoon and we wanted to go out to a local restaurant on our last night. Found Flavia through TA (thanks reviewers!) and we were able to make reservations with no problem on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was busy, but Dayro greeted us with a huge smile and sat us near the window. John Paul came by to our table and even though he spoke little English, it was not a problem! We were able to point at the menu with our choices (jlamon and caprese for appetizers, husband had the ravioletti ricotta with truffle cream and mushrooms, I had the house linguini, and a fruit tart for dessert--all were excellent!) and John Paul understood. He was attentive, but not overbearing, made us laugh, and had a fun attitude! My husband used Google Translate to mention to him that he was the best waiter he had ever met. When he read the message, his eyes lit up and he brought the message to Dayro and both came running back to the table with big smiles. We casually mentioned that we were on our honeymoon and this was where the real fun began! Dayro stepped away for a few moments when the music suddenly changed to a happy birthday song. From across the restaurant, he ran towards our table with a firework in hand. Dayro and John Paul surprised us with cheesecake (that I mistakenly thought was flan), and drinks for the rest of the night! We were treated like we were part of their family and found friendship with Dayro and John Paul. Thank you for making our last night of our honeymoon unforgettable! We hope to visit again one day!",2018-10-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7895442-Reviews-or60-Flavia_Restaurant_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_34008,0.007,0.777,0.216,0.9977,0.3208333333333334,0.4555555555555555,0.3682315789473684,1807,161,0.0890979524073049,11,40,False,62,0.1219512195121951,0.2073170731707317,0.2560975609756097,0.1219512195121951,0.1585365853658536,0.0121951219512195,0.0,0.024390243902439,0.0609756097560975,0.0365853658536585,334,190,4.413173652694611,0,0,husband love restaur much decid first review want great italian food amaz servic come server john paul manag dayro took excel care us husband madrid portion honeymoon want go local restaur last night found flavia ta thank review abl make reserv problem wednesday night restaur busi dayro greet us huge smile sat us near window john paul came tabl even though spoke littl english problem abl point menu choic jlamon capres appet husband ravioletti ricotta truffl cream mushroom hous linguini fruit tart dessert excel john paul understood attent overbear made us laugh fun attitud husband use googl translat mention best waiter ever met read messag eye lit brought messag dayro came run back tabl big smile casual mention honeymoon real fun began dayro step away moment music suddenli chang happi birthday song across restaur ran toward tabl firework hand dayro john paul surpris us cheesecak mistakenli thought flan drink rest night treat like part famili found friendship dayro john paul thank make last night honeymoon unforgett hope visit one day,good review,4,Italian

The staff were nice and the restaurant itself is comfortable, but the food left a lot to be desired. We started with the spinach salad, which was nice but I feel a little overpriced. We moved onto the pasta and risotto dishes; we had the bolognese and the cava risotto. The bolognese was entirely forgettable and the risotto had almost no taste at all.  The waiter noticed that I had barely touched my dish and kindly offered to switch it for something else, but with both dishes being so disappointing I wasn't too confident about trying a third.

Not being a typical sherry drinker, I was unsure about a positive drinking experience. I was there to see a way of life, going back to the days of the Spanish civil war. The room was dark and dusty, and looked like the cleaner had been sacked years ago. The barman's shirt looked like it could do with a good ironing, and he was not over enthusiastic about our arrival. Anyway, down to business. We ordered two number 3's from a list of 5 sherries. Number 1 is the palest, number 5 is the darkest. Whereas the number 3 was hardly memorable, it gave me time to study what was going on in the bar, and what was available. It was obvious that the drink to buy was the number 1, (Manzanilla) It was the cheapest too!

We went in the early afternoon - probably the worst time to be drinking sherry, which IS after all fortified wine. Did the locals think it was a bad idea? Nah! But they are not wussy little tourists they are R.E.G.U.L.A.R.S. They stroll in about 12ish linger over their 3-4 glasses, taking their pick from the lighter, sweeter amontillado or the crisp dry manzanilla or the darker oloroso which wasn't available when we went. Tapas are limited in variety and basic - olives, bread and manchego, dried fish, slices of Iberian jamon, nuts. The owner is soft-spoken and quiet and when we went it was just him manning the bar and a crowd of 20 odd customers, most of whom have been coming here for 20-40 years ( yes, we found someone who spoke English and gave us a helping hand). The interior is dark and cool, a few old tables, mostly standing room. The hum of conversation is often pierced by laughter or a loud exclamation and regulars from other tables chip in with comments. You are the outsider - you know it, but it's reassuring that every time you meet a strangers gaze you see curiosity and a friendly smile. No hostility here - they accept you into a select group that comes together for the love of sherry, for sherry is the focus here. Dusty old bottles glint in the light of old old lampshades. The shelves behind the bar is lined with row upon row and you can bet one of them contains a genie.  Your bill is tabulated on the wooden bar counter in chalk. €13 for 6 sherries and a couple of tapas. Come for atmosphere, to see how the locals drink. Come because you want to snatch a glimpse of days that are past. But most of all, come for the love of Sherry.",2012-07-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717308-Reviews-or150-La_Venencia-Madrid.html,UID_34015,0.052,0.812,0.136,0.9875,0.0288220551378446,0.4157477025898077,0.324195,1782,160,0.0897867564534231,1,56,False,49,0.1228070175438596,0.1052631578947368,0.2280701754385964,0.0526315789473684,0.087719298245614,0.087719298245614,0.0526315789473684,0.0350877192982456,0.1578947368421052,0.0701754385964912,334,217,4.335329341317365,0,0,speak english sure find someon drink least littl went earli afternoon probabl worst time drink sherri fortifi wine local think bad idea nah wussi littl tourist r e g u l r stroll ish linger glass take pick lighter sweeter amontillado crisp dri manzanilla darker oloroso avail went tapa limit varieti basic oliv bread manchego dri fish slice iberian jamon nut owner soft spoken quiet went man bar crowd odd custom come year ye found someon spoke english gave us help hand interior dark cool old tabl mostli stand room hum convers often pierc laughter loud exclam regular tabl chip comment outsid know reassur everi time meet stranger gaze see curios friendli smile hostil accept select group come togeth love sherri sherri focu dusti old bottl glint light old old lampshad shelv behind bar line row upon row bet one contain geni bill tabul wooden bar counter chalk sherri coupl tapa come atmospher see local drink come want snatch glimps day past come love sherri,average review,3,Spanish

I was treated like family almost immediately after showing interest and appreciation for the food. Miguel works much of the front of the house and he is outgoing and knowledgeable.  The food was exceptional. A word of note though, the Spanish like their pasta a bit more cooked than traditional al dente that Italians and Americans prefer, so if you order pasta please advise your waiter how you prefer your pasta as they tend to serve the locals.  The food was all exceptional. I highly recommend the veal meatballs ""albondigas"" ... They were some of the  best I have had. The bolognese is also exceptional.  The pizza is traditional Neopolitan and some of the best in Madrid. But if there was a can't miss item it would be the burratta ...

This restaurant was recommended by our hotel. It is very close to Retiro Park. We went there twice during our stay in Madrid and had pizza and pastas. The pepperoni pizza as well as the veal meatball tagliatella were memorably fantastic. The wine was also very reasonable at 3.50 euros a glass.  We didnt have any dessert or starters but all the mains we had were good; pesto pasta, gnacchi with peppers and tomatoes. The bill for 4 people came to about 100 euros. The mains were about 14-17 euros each. Nothing to complain. The staff was very accomodating when we showed up around 8 pm ( which is very early for Spain) for dinner.

Tucked down a small lane way, Flavia is a surprise in many ways. We entered thinking it would be a traditional small Italian restaurant and were surprised to find a 3-level restaurant bar with live band. We didn't have a reservation but that was no problem and we were escorted to the quieter downstairs dining area. The menu was extensive as was the wine list and all fairly priced. A plate of fresh mortadella and breads was placed on the table (chargeable) and we devoured the mortadella in seconds. My wife chose fresh spaghetti bolognaise and myself the freshly made meat agnolotti ametricana. We both agreed it was some of the best pasta we had ever had. As we were leaving, the manager/owner asked if we would like to stay and enjoy the live music upstairs which if we did not have a prior engagement we would have as it sounded great, but we said we would be back.  The next day we went back fro lunch and he greeted us with a big smile and asked why we didn't come back last night! He really looked after us and made our final meal in Madrid special.",2015-07-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7895442-Reviews-or240-Flavia_Restaurant_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_34062,0.0,0.8,0.2,0.9941,0.1773223304473304,0.3800099206349206,0.2049181818181818,1185,108,0.0911392405063291,1,21,False,60,0.0512820512820512,0.1538461538461538,0.3076923076923077,0.1025641025641025,0.1282051282051282,0.0,0.0,0.0769230769230769,0.1025641025641025,0.0769230769230769,222,141,4.337837837837838,0,0,function attend later even want find good italian restaur eat dinner wow find tuck small lane way flavia surpris mani way enter think would tradit small italian restaur surpris find level restaur bar live band reserv problem escort quieter downstair dine area menu extens wine list fairli price plate fresh mortadella bread place tabl chargeabl devour mortadella second wife chose fresh spaghetti bolognais freshli made meat agnolotti ametricana agre best pasta ever leav manag owner ask would like stay enjoy live music upstair prior engag would sound great said would back next day went back fro lunch greet us big smile ask come back last night realli look us made final meal madrid special,good review,4,Italian

We were lucky to get a table on a late Thursday evening without a reservation. There was only one waitress, very friendly and smiling, especially considering the restaurant was full. An angel. Prices were reasonable (see photo of bill) although we didn't eat much. The pizza looked huge but we didn't have one. Instead, we started with ""garlic bread"", which really wasn't. It was ""bruschetta"", which is tomatoes, pesto and pecorino cheese  on toast. Fresh and subtle. Then, we had Fagottini. Fagottini (from ""fagotto"", meaning bundle; fagottini = little bundles) is a type of pasta, about the size of ravioli, and normally filled with some kind of vegetables. Here, they are filled with ricotta cheese and pears and served with a hint of amaretto sauce and almonds. Because of the pear, it tasted more like a dessert, and the portion was quite small, so I won't recommend it to anyone averse to sweet food, or is hungry! The other dish we had was ""Chitarrine ai porcini con crema al tartufo"". Chitarrine is a flat form of spaghetti, a narrower form of tagliatelle, but taste more like the former rather than the latter. Ours was served with porcini mushrooms and truffle cream. I think they make their own pasta and it was cooked al dente, the way pasta ought to be served. Portion, again, was a bit on the paucity side, so you may need to order something more than just this if you're having it as your main course. Taste was exquisite. In conclusion, I can safely recommend this ""Little Devil"" ;-) for the super waitress and the good food and if I fancy Italian in Madrid, this will be on my list.",2018-06-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3438302-Reviews-or20-PICCOLO_DIAVOLO-Madrid.html,UID_34068,0.032,0.849,0.119,0.982,0.2084459459459459,0.5644144144144145,0.31384,1771,148,0.0835686053077357,1,74,False,60,0.1142857142857142,0.2,0.2857142857142857,0.0714285714285714,0.1428571428571428,0.0285714285714285,0.0285714285714285,0.0142857142857142,0.0857142857142857,0.0285714285714285,312,212,4.676282051282051,0,0,piccolo diavolo littl devil situat one side street close atocha prado reina sof cosi intim quit small cover perhap lucki get tabl late thursday even without reserv one waitress friendli smile especi consid restaur full angel price reason see photo bill although eat much pizza look huge one instead start garlic bread realli bruschetta tomato pesto pecorino chees toast fresh subtl fagottini fagottini fagotto mean bundl fagottini littl bundl type pasta size ravioli normal fill kind veget fill ricotta chees pear serv hint amaretto sauc almond pear tast like dessert portion quit small recommend anyon avers sweet food hungri dish chitarrin ai porcini con crema al tartufo chitarrin flat form spaghetti narrow form tagliatel tast like former rather latter serv porcini mushroom truffl cream think make pasta cook al dent way pasta ought serv portion bit pauciti side may need order someth main cours tast exquisit conclus safe recommend littl devil super waitress good food fanci italian madrid list,good review,4,Italian

As for the pizzas, you would be disappointed if you expected wooden-fired-oven-style pizzas. However, among all the ones I've tried in Madrid, this probably the best one.

It must be unique, not just in Madrid but in the world. Unchanged and undusted in decades, walls plastered with nicotine stained posters of Ferias de Jerez dating back to the 1950's which would undoubtedly disintegrate if touched. And serving the most delicious sherry of all the classic types , all chilled, which in my book is a mistake, but it would invite mayhem to suggest it...! I think the warnings about unfriendliness are exaggerated, as are the obvious myths about why photography is banned. Taking photos in bars is a nasty habit dating back not much more than a decade, and any ban is greatly to be welcomed. Anyway who wants a photo of yellowing mouldering walls and a few barrels?

The smell is a bit musty and the walls look damp, but I'd say that adds to the character, along with the nicotine stained and peeling posters on the walls. The sherry is stored in big barrels up against the bar wall. This is dispensed into 5 bottles - one for each type of sherry - then stored in a terracotta planter full of ice. We had 2 glasses each of Fino. It was lovely and at 1.7 euros a glass, we did not feel ripped off, since we were tourists. We arrived in the evening just as it was opening. We were the only tourists there, whilst a few locals came in. Our service was surly.  My wife was told quite firmly ""no photos!"" when she took her camera out. The locals got the usual free tapas on purchase, we got nothing both times. It's definitely worth one try when in Madrid, but that's it.
