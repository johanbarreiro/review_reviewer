I followed this with croquetas with Spanish ham which were simply mouthwatering. Next was the Spanish omelette with black truffles which was served medium-rare. I was initially not convinced by the concept but surprisingly it worked well, the texture was 'velvety' and the subtle flavour of truffles made the dish very special. Another interesting take on Spanish classics came next in the form of grilled squid stuffed into steamed buns. And again it worked really well. The only little setback here was the 'special mayo' that the dish was supposed to feature and of which there was very little and it also didn't taste much different from a regular mayo. The last dish, grilled pork loin with green salsa and cheese sauce was a great way to finish the meal. The meat was cooked perfectly, the cheese sauce was creamy and flavoursome and the salsa light and refreshing. To accompany the food I was recommended a very nice, fruity white wine which worked very well especially with the squid. Apart from the food it is worth mentioning the really wonderful and attentive staff of the restaurant. Both Ana and David were extremely helpful and accommodating but also the other members of the Rosi crew were very nice and answered all questions and requests with bright smiles on their faces. I can highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try traditional Spanish food sometimes in a slightly more adventurous form and enjoy the ambience of this cosy, colourful restaurant in the heart of Madrid.",2018-02-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7204621-Reviews-or850-Rosi_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_11099,0.005,0.74,0.256,0.9982,0.2665256211180123,0.5209424271380793,0.1920714285714286,1655,132,0.0797583081570997,0,26,False,67,0.0806451612903225,0.2096774193548387,0.3548387096774194,0.0483870967741935,0.2419354838709677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032258064516129,0.032258064516129,283,168,4.851590106007067,0,0,wonder time rosi la loca taberna food excel roast potato garlic chiptol sauc great start meal follow croqueta spanish ham simpli mouthwat next spanish omelett black truffl serv medium rare initi convinc concept surprisingli work well textur velveti subtl flavour truffl made dish special anoth interest take spanish classic came next form grill squid stuf steam bun work realli well littl setback special mayo dish suppos featur littl also tast much differ regular mayo last dish grill pork loin green salsa chees sauc great way finish meal meat cook perfectli chees sauc creami flavoursom salsa light refresh accompani food recommend nice fruiti white wine work well especi squid apart food worth mention realli wonder attent staff restaur ana david extrem help accommod also member rosi crew nice answer question request bright smile face highli recommend place anyon want tri tradit spanish food sometim slightli adventur form enjoy ambienc cosi colour restaur heart madrid,good review,4,Spanish

Cocktails are nicely done and certainly worth a try. The food was disappointing though. We had expected much more. The spicy potatoes were far from spicy so it fell a bit flat on its promise. The croquet jambon had a nice crispy outside but the filling was so soft that it just came dripping out almost like sauce. The seared Tuna was nicely done and is certainly a nice dish both in presentation and taste. There was another dish of which i forgot the name which was like a tortilla with beef? It tasted very muffy for some reason.

We went back on Saturday & - oh dear - the situation was very different. Service was indifferent - for example, we had to ask for plates & oil & vinegar to go with the bread they delivered & just walked away - and the food, when it finally arrived, was cold. My steak was actually cold to the touch! We sent it back, & they just microwaved it. The ‚ÄòFrench fries‚Äô they promised turned out to be undercooked saut√© potatoes; when I complained, they said this was what they called ‚ÄúFrench fries‚Äù. Ok, so they then gave us free desserts, but by then the mood had been spoiled - and the vanilla ice cream turned out to be (unwelcome) lemon sorbet. The manager came out to apologise, & explained that they were having problems with the electrical supply, but that really didn‚Äôt explain the poor service & cold food.

Amicis is such a lovely restaurant visually, but what makes this place special is the mouth watering food and drinks, as well as the atmosphere and not forgetting the exceptionally friendly staff. We were staying locally, so made a point of popping in every day for either brunch, lunch, dinner and for just a sharing board and wine one afternoon, which we enjoyed on their very sunny terrace!

Cutting to the chase: we came back twice in 3 days we loved it that much.  We received the warmest welcome on arrival from Fabio and Maria; something most restaurants have forgotten how to do these days. The location and style of venue is relaxing, fun and stylish. The menu was so good it was difficult for us to choose. The quality and presentation of the food was sensational and extremely good value. We washed all this down with some beautiful red wine, chosen by my wine connoisseur colleague; which he rated highly.  Service was at the perfect pace, with staff checking that we were all happy throughout without making you feel pressured.  The atmosphere made you feel at home with people enjoying the surroundings whilst delving into the gorgeous food.  The venue is full of taste and has been brought back to life with revealing some of the original walls of the building - as well as creating a private room for parties which we would love to have made use of with a longer stay.  Thank you Amicis for creating a restaurant which is the epitome of what a restaurant is all about: Amazing atmosphere and food.  We will be seeing you again.

We were greeted warmly on entering, and treated very well throughout our meal. The food, starting with mozzarella sticks and having ribs and pulled pork for mains, was tremendous and fresh. Everything you could tell had been made there and then and had the care and attention you would expect from a family run establishment. The ribs, slow cooked for three days were tender and flavoursome, a real delight! The pulled pork sandwiches were exceptional, both dishes accompanied by superb french fries and a hot dip (very hot if you have too much!) which had a superb subtelty of flavour. I loved it.  All in all I would recommend Alright very highly! Very good food, for a reasonable price (you would pay similar if not perhaps even more in the UK), with fantastic service and a great atmosphere ( it was very busy but never stressed).

I had the mozzarella triangles with a sweet chilli sauce, which were amazing, but when the owner brought out a sample of the fake risotto to try, I fell in love and asked if I could change my main course order, (having ordered the cheeseburger), they went one better, giving me my cheeseburger (with no bun - they said it would be too much and they were right) and risotto on the side.

The owner came over to us and explained many things on the menu, and even some special items that weren't listed. Everything in the restaurant is homemade except the bread- on Tuesdays, they spend the whole day making the nachos from scratch- both the dough and the condiments. The sauces are all unique and homemade with such detail, time, and thought that makes the dining experience so unique.

Hamburgers are quite good (but not the best in Madrid), and as I said ribs are exceptional).  The local is nice and comfortable.

American food made with love"". Waste time and money on American style food when in Madrid, Spain? Not usually but the rating and comments intrigued. Nearly 8 km out from central Madrid but acceptably accessible by metro (exit Barrio del Pilar station) and about a 10 minute walk. Opens 1400, arrived about 1415 on a Tuesday afternoon and already half full. Table for two available but suspect a reservation might be prudent, was packed by about 1430. Ordered starters/entrees ""Smoking Wings"" and the (off menu ... ask wait staff) ""Fungi Risotto"" with shaved Manchego (cheese) and a touch of black truffle. Mains, the flagship ""Alright Ribs"" and the ""Porky's Sandwich"".  Smoking Wings nothing special, bit too dry, in (smoking?) sauce plus small supplementary bowl of sauce. Sauce definitely not ""smoking"" (if meant to imply spicy and hot) ... more like a mild barbeque sauce. Fungi Risotto ... superb. Umm ... well that's about it really ... simply superb. Right up there with the best we've ever had ... anywhere on this planet. If you like mushrooms (and if this was their usual standard), you WILL enjoy. Alright Ribs ... their flagship and a real standout. Unlike the drowned in baste/sauce varying from ""pleasantly barbeque"" through ""too sweet, too sour, too spicy, too bland"" served at 99.9% of rib joints ... to disguise the dried out texture, these ribs were almost devoid of sauce and had a ""dry rub/light grill"" appearance. Incredibly tender and superbly moist with a natural ""meat"" taste. Literally ""fall off the bone"", the rib bones could be lifted out of the meat completely devoid of adhering meat tissue. Generous amount of meat. Looking at the menu's claimed ""48 horus"" (hours) preparation time I think it would be appropriate to suspect a ""sous-vide"" ultra low temperature cook procedure followed by a ""flash grill"" for colour (or color if you are from a country that does ""English lite""). Highly recommended (no, not ""English lite"", THE RIBS). Porky's Sandwich ... A light soft hamburger bun with a generous amount of very tender pulled pork drenched in a ""just right"" barbeque sauce and with a small amount of enclosed salad. Not the ""wow"" factor of the risotto or ribs but still very good compared to the usual ""hamburger style"" offerings usually encountered elsewhere. Both ribs and sandwich offered with small accompanying fries or salad. We both chose fries but as encountered elsewhere in Madrid (Spain in general?) they were a rather ""limp"" shoestring variety. Properly cooked ... but probably for a long time in way too cold oil. Not our preference ... but if that's the way the locals like 'em, so be it. Lubrication, a blanco/white wine of unrecognised label. ""2016 Verdejo"" (2016 green olive) ... beats me too, but was pleasantly light and drinkable. A ""compassionate"" 5 out of 5. Compassionate because I consider that any criticism automatically disqualifies a maximum score. However, in this case the overall excellence of the food doesn't deserve downgrading by such a large ""minimum amount"" (20%) simply because of the mediocre chicken wings.

After checking TripAdvisor, we were pleasantly surprised to find this highly rated upscale restaurant literally around the corner from our hotel. It was nicely decorated and provided a great atmosphere. We started with sliced calamari rings that were lightly breaded and fried to perfection. For entrees, I had the suckling pig that was excellent. My wife had the monkfish. It was fabulous and much more than expected being served as a whole fish sans head, in a wonderful oil and garlic sauce. For dessert we shared a slice of almond cake and coffee‚Äîa perfect end to a delicious meal and a wonderful evening.

The food and Service was fantastic but the best part was the cultural experience. We were seated and immediately served a teaser: 2 pieces of blended spicy sausage, it was delicious. We ordered a salad for 2, and I forgot they serve fish on their salads but it was still tasty (I did scrape the fish aside): and though we were out for steak which they had; we opted for the 1/4 pig for 2; which was served with potatoes and was very juicy and tasty. The table next to us ordered the steak; again the experience, they bring the cooked dish out for your view them take it back to cut it for serving; the steak is served with a clay grill so each person can cook it to their liking as it is cut/sliced for you. It smelled so lovely and they were definitely enjoying their meal as we were ours. At the end of the meal the bring what we, being American, thought looked like oil and vinegar. We were perplexed as the bread was served first: we asked and they said ‚Äúyou drink a shot of each to help with digestion‚Äù. So we did in Spain as Spaniards do, it gives us a little buzz whatever it was, lol. The best was watching others enjoying their meal, talking with their friends and family, relaxing it really was a social gathering, no cell phones, people actually talking to one another laughing and enjoying good food and Good company.

Maria made everything so easy from the initial booking to sorting out food choices and gave us the private room downstairs which was absolutely perfect for what we needed (a bit of space of our own without disturbing other customers). The restaurant itself is really lovely and the food was exceptional with the group having a variety of things from the menu and everyone clearing their plates. In particular the steaks were cooked very well and the sharing boards were perfect and very good value for money.  I want to say a BIG thank you to the bar and waiting team at Amicis who were excellent and dealt with a group of 18 women admirably, going out of their way to accommodate our requests and having a bit of fun with the group, wearing big smiles on their faces - thank you, you added to our Madrid experience and I couldn‚Äôt recommend Amicis more highly, both as part of a group and as a fun, good quality restaurant to visit while in Madrid ",2018-06-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12880799-Reviews-or220-Amicis-Madrid.html,UID_11213,0.005,0.73,0.266,0.9961,0.4005303030303029,0.5493939393939393,0.183275,1072,100,0.0932835820895522,0,12,False,41,0.1698113207547169,0.2075471698113207,0.2452830188679245,0.0943396226415094,0.2075471698113207,0.0188679245283018,0.0,0.0,0.0188679245283018,0.0377358490566037,200,125,4.355,0,0,leav review restaur visit friday st june hen parti best time maria made everyth easi initi book sort food choic gave us privat room downstair absolut perfect need bit space without disturb custom restaur realli love food except group varieti thing menu everyon clear plate particular steak cook well share board perfect good valu money want say big thank bar wait team amici excel dealt group women admir go way accommod request bit fun group wear big smile face thank ad madrid experi recommend amici highli part group fun good qualiti restaur visit madrid,very good review,5,Spanish

The staff are very friendly, but also put you entirely at your ease. The proprietor is great and his mother is wonderful. During the course of the meal she brought out three freebies just for me to try - her take on gazpachio soup, little toasts with special salt (delicious but I never found out what was special about them!) and some little fried balls that were very tasty. I went with their recommendation to start, which was very tasty - risotto with truffle oil and mushrooms. Then ribs as per the trip advisor recommendations. The meat simply melted from the bone, in an amazing sauce. Good chips too. I have never before done the thing where you close your eyes involuntarily when you taste something. I did tonight. To top it off, a delicious 'Arab tart' (I think that was the translation) and two ice cold pints of beers on 2 for 1. All for less than e25. So lovely, so tasty, so welcoming.

We turned up without a reservation, and luckily for us they squeezed us in and could not do enough to make our visit special.  The owner leads from the front, and has a fantastic and infectious personality, carefully explaining each dish. Really attentive and cannot do enough for you.  We had broken eggs to start (share). I'd had this before in Spain but not tasting like this. It was mixed at the table and tasted amazing!! Even my 16 year old daughter who is fussy liked it.  For mains the girls had ribs (to die for) and me and my son had a New Delhi burger and Phili cheese steak. All meals were really well seasoned and tasted amazing. No leftovers!! Finding room for a dessert, we sampled the cheesecake and brownie. In most restaurants the dessert is often a let down. Not here. As much care went into these dishes as they did the main meal. Perfect end to the visit.  As the one who pays the bill, the best thing came at the end, as the bill was really reasonable and the service quick and efficient.

We got a big selection of foods, all of which tasted amazing, and was great value. The waiter, Monty, absolutely rounded off the experience - he was extremely friendly, professional and efficient, with an impressive memory (he took the orders for our table and the one next to ours by memory, and not a mistake!). He was very thoughtful with the bringing out of dishes as well, so we were only working on 2 dishes at any time, ensuring we got hot, freshly-prepared tapas the whole meal through. We had the patatas in alioli sauce (large), the truffle omelette, chicken wings, croquettes (small), pork loin, and two of the tropical mocktails between 2, and we were absolutely stuffed at the end. You could easily fill up for under 15 euros per person (we went harder and spent about 20 each), and it was absolutely delicious.

Our dinner here is a fond memory that we will surely cherish for a very long time, and I very strongly recommend it. We had the tasting menus at 38 euros (there is also a 29 euro version with fewer courses), and the experience was magnificent. There's more than enough food to fill you up, even if you don't stuff yourself with their bread, and the dishes are extremely varied and very, very tasty. We also loved the desserts that the menu came with, and in fact we were simply impressed with every single thing we tasted. It is also important to mention the ma√Ætre; he was bursting with enthusiasm from the moment we walked in to the the moment we left, and he didn't waste a single opportunity to try to make our meal as pleasant as possible. Some other reviewers commented that his outlandish nature lessened the experience, but we found him endearing. It is worth mentioning that you do not have to choose the tasting menu and can instead order √† la carte, although I highly recommend the tasting menu. One final tip is to call ahead and book a table, because the restaurant is quite small and they aren't open for very long.",2017-11-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10284384-Reviews-or30-Shalakabula-Madrid.html,UID_674,0.0,0.857,0.143,0.9752,0.2198681972789116,0.581516439909297,0.5159875,1214,113,0.0930807248764415,0,26,False,42,0.1702127659574468,0.1276595744680851,0.3191489361702128,0.0851063829787234,0.2127659574468085,0.0,0.0212765957446808,0.0,0.0638297872340425,0.0,221,149,4.497737556561086,0,0,littl restaur offer amaz experi miss dinner fond memori sure cherish long time strongli recommend tast menu euro also euro version fewer cours experi magnific enough food fill even stuff bread dish extrem vari tasti also love dessert menu came fact simpli impress everi singl thing tast also import mention tre burst enthusiasm moment walk moment left wast singl opportun tri make meal pleasant possibl review comment outlandish natur lessen experi found endear worth mention choos tast menu instead order la cart although highli recommend tast menu one final tip call ahead book tabl restaur quit small open long,good review,4,French

We got a table right near the door, which didn't give us much of a sense of the restaurant, but did allow for people-watching on the street.  The place is known for its paella, but we were more in the mood for tapas. (The table next to us got paella, and it looked fantastic.)  Among the items we ordered: Patatas bravas, solomillo de cerdo, and a cheese injected with pesto. Everything was fantastic.  Jordan was helpful and very funny.

As it was, we found it by accident, wandering the neighborhoods. From the outside, it looked warm, cozy, bustling with happy patrons and servers. It was filled with art, music, laughter and amazing smells. We stuck our head in and asked if they had room for us. We apologized that we had no reservation. The host was so accommodating and kind. He really took his time looking at the seating chart and the pending reservations. It would have been so easy for him to just turn us away, but instead he made room. He told us when he would need the table by, but despite that, never rushed us. Even when we were coming up to the time for the next reservation, I tried to catch his eye to pay, and he made it clear that we should relax and enjoy ourselves. All things in good time. All smiles.  As for the food and the drinks: Wow! This South American restaurant was slinging some of the tastiest food I've had in a very long time. (My mouth is watering just remembering our meal). Because we had less than an hour, we chose to have cocktails and split three dishes. We had one of the specials, one of the ceviche, and one of the taco plates, and it filled us up. We also tried the cocktail special which was a mango habanero margarita. A tricky drink. There's many ways it can go wrong. The bartender created a perfectly balanced drink, with a nice amount of smoke, sweetness, and heat. It was delicious. All of our food (and the food we observed around us) was gorgeous, delicious, and perfectly and quickly executed from the semi open kitchen in the back. I recommend this restaurant highly and would suggest reservations.

Fortunately for us, the other place was packed so we found Bresca.  Very small, but since we were dining long before the traditional Spanish dinner time, there was an empty table. Four of us shared 2 pizzas and Sangria (of course). We are not huge eaters, but we are not light either. The 2 pizzas were just enough. Not like North American pizza these were very thin crust with very light sauce and mozzarella not grated, but rather melted balls like in a tomato mozzarella salad. The tomato were halved cherry tomatoes. The taste and texture was amazing.  Our server spoke just enough English that we could communicate effectively and took excellent care of us. The entire meal for 4 was just over 50 Euro) Just as we finished the place was completely full with people waiting outside.

The shrimp were small without shells on a crunchy green banana tortilla with coconut rice which was very flavorful and delicious. Everything was superb!!! Had a cocktail which was also great.

The lovely waiter came across and explained the menu to us which was a very nice touch. The starter was a set starter, Cold carrot soup wuth coconut and curry. I am a fussy eater however it was very good. we both had fish taco's for main which had on the side home made pico de gallo, homemade nacho's with a hot cheese sauce. very tasty, desert was a mango dessert, very refreshing and tasty.

However for the first few evenings had been disappointed with the restaurants we had eaten at in terms of either service or quality of food, but we found this wonderful restaurant for the last night of our trip.  For the last evening we were looking for something a bit special as the trip was to celebrate one of the couples 50th birthdays. After some searching on TripAdvisor we found Casa Jaguar which already had very good ratings. One of our group contacted them via Facebook and following a swift message exchange a booking was made with one of the co-owners Marianno (we also requested candles for a cake as part of the meal). The restaurant nestles down a side street off the Plaza de Santa Domingo and despite the external appearance is surprising large inside. We were warmly greeted by the staff (who were very friendly and attentive) and shown to our table. The food was excellent and had a real South American influence and was very fresh and certainly tasty and by far and away surpassed anything we had eaten thus far on our trip. The cost for the food was reasonable and the wine was not excessively priced either. Marianno made himself known and we were treated to a few shots in celebration of the birthday couple (it was his as well so we bought him a drink). He also delivered on the candles and all in all we had a great time. We would certainly recommend this restaurant to anybody visiting Madrid and statying around the area of the Grand Via and Plaza Mayor.

The flavours are well balanced and the serving is generous. We didnt have room for dessert or cocktails. I watched the yong woman making several though and wished I had tried the lemonade and the Pisca Sours, they looked really good. The lemon/lime juice is freshly squeezed and it looked great. The decor is funky and fun and they even have a 1970's style arcade game that you can play for free.

Every other time I go down town, I try to savor the delis served in Sr.Ito The food is simply fascinating, all kind of flavor combinations imploding in your mouth the ""japo-burrito"", the sausage and b√©arnaise sauce gyozas, and their nigiris, eel with foie, butter fish with miso sauce or flamb√© salmon with citrus are a must, simply dilicious. And on top of that, a cozy and friendly atmosphere that you will want to repeat again as soon as you step out of Sr.Ito. Every time a newcomer arrives in Madrid, I take him/her there, since Sr.Ito never lets you down. If I had to describe the kind of food, that would be a Japanese based restaurant with a Spanish touch, but also French, Peruvian and Thai, which makes it a perfect combo. It is true, that sometimes on weekends it is full on and reservations early in the week are the only way to get a table, but on week days it is not so hectic and meanwhile you are tasting exquisite dishes, you can better enjoy the friendly stuff.",2017-10-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10232563-Reviews-or30-Sr_Ito-Madrid.html,UID_11619,0.0,0.865,0.135,0.9804,0.2629227053140097,0.5163733609385784,0.43132,1067,94,0.0880974695407685,0,30,False,38,0.1568627450980392,0.2156862745098039,0.2745098039215686,0.0392156862745098,0.2352941176470588,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0392156862745098,0.0,0.0196078431372549,198,132,4.393939393939394,0,0,one year half sinc open becom landmark restaur madrid everi time go town tri savor deli serv sr ito food simpli fascin kind flavor combin implod mouth japo burrito sausag b arnais sauc gyoza nigiri eel foie butter fish miso sauc flamb salmon citru must simpli dilici top cozi friendli atmospher want repeat soon step sr ito everi time newcom arriv madrid take sinc sr ito never let describ kind food would japanes base restaur spanish touch also french peruvian thai make perfect combo true sometim weekend full reserv earli week way get tabl week day hectic meanwhil tast exquisit dish better enjoy friendli stuff,good review,4,Japanese

It was my birthday dinner, and the experience started off well, with us joking and sharing laughs with the owner, who was welcoming and fun. The seaweed salad and edamame Sr.Ito had a nice flavor but was excessively salty. The gyozas were average and nothing special. We ordered a bunch of nigiri, and the rice was room temperature and not the correct temperature (body temperature). None of it had wasabi applied.  We then ordered the matcha and chocolate cake and carrot cake for dessert along with some hot teas. Our waiter set down our teas, which were in glass cups, and one of the cups broke and spilled hot tea all over my leg, causing burning pain! He cleaned the spill on the floor with napkins, but then proceeded to place those dirty, soaked napkins on our table! He apologized profusely and applied toothpaste to my leg to help with the burn. When I returned to the table, the desserts had been sitting out with the ice cream melting. He didn't offer new scoops of ice cream. The carrot cake was too sweet. We each had one bite and didn't touch it again. The matcha cake was good but also on the sweet side.  At this point, we were willing to overlook what occurred, because accidents happen, but the waiter added insult to injury when he gave us the bill and said ""everything was ok."" Everything was NOT ok. We did not enjoy our dinner, and I left with a burn. The owner avoided us and never came to apologize. He sat at another diner's table next to us chatting with them and would glance over but never approached us after the accident, nor did he offer to compensate by comping the bill or even a portion of it. In the states where we are from, that's how it would've been handled. My godmother voiced her displeasure, to which the waiter repeatedly said it's not his fault and that there was nothing he could do personally. That's not the point. He may not have been able to do something, but the BUSINESS can, and failed to. The waiter finally offered to comp one of the desserts, as if that would make us happy. We don't care about 5‚Ç¨; they can keep it. It's just really bad business how the situation was handled, and we will never be back.

Normally, this is the type of place I would walk by without a second glance. Thank goodness for Trip advisor and its reviewers, as it came up as a great option for the area we were in! We walked into this place not knowing what to expect, and were delighted with our meal. The kitchen is open, so nothing is hidden. Everything is made fresh, so dietary needs can likely be met. They had an English menu, and everyone spoke way better English than I did Spanish (how embarrassing for me) We started with the Inca salad (shared with my hubby, plenty enough for 2), and then I had the Risotto, and my husband the tacos. What a treat! All the dishes were bursting with flavor, and delicious. While waiting for our dishes, I watched the owner, change the music, singing as he moved about tidying up, and meticulously clean the bar, wash the glasses, and check the overall appearance of the restaurant. It was a unique experience to watch him take so much pride in his ""baby"". We spoke with him later, and he was a delightful young man (at least 30 years my junior)! We had great food, some very nice wine (3 glasses), and topped it off with the coconut flan. Yum! We were then rewarded with an aperitif ""on the house"" (which seems to be a common tradition in this country). All this for under 50 Euros. Please...avoid all those places in the squares, plazas and those scattered everywhere along the tourist paths, walk a few blocks and discover a lovely place to dine, with lots of atmosphere, super clean, and support a local young man with a commitment to serve great food. I am sure you won't be disappointed. After all, I am very fussy about everything...quality of food, cleanliness, decent wine for a decent price, and prefer organic when I can get it. If I was delighted, I can only imagine how you will feel. I attached a menu so you can check it out.",2017-05-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10382291-Reviews-or80-Casa_Jaguar_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_11675,0.011,0.797,0.192,0.997,0.2439583333333332,0.5263888888888889,0.39466,1891,177,0.0936012691697514,4,72,False,57,0.1122448979591836,0.173469387755102,0.2755102040816326,0.0918367346938775,0.1224489795918367,0.0204081632653061,0.0306122448979591,0.0408163265306122,0.0918367346938775,0.0408163265306122,349,218,4.421203438395415,0,0,well folk first normal type place would walk without second glanc thank good trip advisor review came great option area walk place know expect delight meal kitchen open noth hidden everyth made fresh dietari need like met english menu everyon spoke way better english spanish embarrass start inca salad share hubbi plenti enough risotto husband taco treat dish burst flavor delici wait dish watch owner chang music sing move tidi meticul clean bar wash glass check overal appear restaur uniqu experi watch take much pride babi spoke later delight young man least year junior great food nice wine glass top coconut flan yum reward aperitif hous seem common tradit countri euro pleas avoid place squar plaza scatter everywher along tourist path walk block discov love place dine lot atmospher super clean support local young man commit serv great food sure disappoint fussi everyth qualiti food cleanli decent wine decent price prefer organ get delight imagin feel attach menu check,good review,4,Spanish

Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the selection of food and wine. I could not have asked for a better recommendation: I had the Peruvian potato wedges with spicy cheese as a starter and the Shrimps on green rice with coconut sauce and pineapple as a main dish. Both were perfectly seasoned and very tasty. The pineapple gave the dish a very interesting sweetness. The potato wedges were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - perfect! I have to say the outside of this place made me wonder if this is going to be worth my while (we were approached by three promoters outside the restaurant trying to lure us into strip clubs), but the food was close to perfection and the service was outstanding.

Kazakhstan, Hong Kong, Bora Bora - it was always an oasis to me.  The visit to El Jardin was supposed another in a line of nice experiences with Intercontinental. Well, I was very wrong.  I didn‚Äôt expect very innovative food, but definitely good one, classical with a classy service. The shock started immediately; we were served bread and butter and the butter was in plastic single portion packs which one would expect at a breakfast in a 3* hotel, but certainly not at an elegant dinner.  They only had one type of wine glasses and they used it for both white and red wine. The glasses were not appropriate for either. Wine tasting after the bottle was opened - forget about it; they just poured almost full glasses and that was it.  Then they forgot to bring the appetizer to the gentleman hosting the dinner; I felt embarrassed... The food was ok, but really just that. At a serving of jamon costing 29‚Ç¨, one would expect much more than ‚Äúok‚Äù. My tortilla de patates with foie gras and saffron was good, but more due to the foie than to the tortilla itself. I was glad I didn‚Äôt order the pasta since it looked very poor (two guests sitting next to me did it). I had red curry with seafood. Fine, but it was a red curry with yellow color; another in a series of mistakes that evening.  The service was totally confused and inefficient; their poor English making the communication difficult. Serving and removing plates from left/right was not a rule, but random. The absolutely worst sight were the waiters taking plates and then - in the middle of the dining room - scraping the leftovers from several plates in their hands to a single one, just like in a cheap diner or company cafeteria.  Instead of a pleasant, elegant dinner, it was a let‚Äôs-get-over-with-it-ASAP for the twelve of us...",2018-10-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4059604-Reviews-El_Jardin_del_InterContinental-Madrid.html,UID_11737,0.099,0.789,0.111,0.443,0.0798083623693379,0.4985423925667828,0.4761473684210526,1949,162,0.0831195484864032,0,58,False,52,0.125,0.125,0.3125,0.0875,0.2125,0.0125,0.0,0.0375,0.075,0.0125,347,205,4.6023054755043225,0,0,intercontinent brand stand assur assur get high standard servic provid matter kazakhstan hong kong bora bora alway oasi visit el jardin suppos anoth line nice experi intercontinent well wrong expect innov food definit good one classic classi servic shock start immedi serv bread butter butter plastic singl portion pack one would expect breakfast hotel certainli eleg dinner one type wine glass use white red wine glass appropri either wine tast bottl open forget pour almost full glass forgot bring appet gentleman host dinner felt embarrass food ok realli serv jamon cost one would expect much ok tortilla de patat foie gra saffron good due foie tortilla glad order pasta sinc look poor two guest sit next red curri seafood fine red curri yellow color anoth seri mistak even servic total confus ineffici poor english make commun difficult serv remov plate left right rule random absolut worst sight waiter take plate middl dine room scrape leftov sever plate hand singl one like cheap diner compani cafeteria instead pleasant eleg dinner let get asap twelv us,bad review,2,Indian

The meat was very good served with hot asparagus and fries both of which were very tasty and the large chips crispy outside. My spouse ordered the sea bass. It came as three pieces of fillet on a bed of sweet potato and she enjoyed it very much. We also shared a salad for which we specified no cucumbers or onion and it came as requested together with a selection of oils and vinegars. The dessert of pannacotta was nothing special.

I read reviews on Trip Advisor; t most were very positive, averaging 4 and in the pictures on their website it looked good, so I risked it. But I must say there were only two good things about Dogma; the people that took good care of us and made for a swift service, and the bill that was quite fairly priced (149‚Ç¨ for 4 people, not bad).  However, the food I am afraid left me unimpressed and feeling rather deceived. The fish soup was a thick concoction, edible but not what we expected. We shared a paella de verduras that was supposed to have mushrooms, but there was no trace of mushroom and it was not tasty! An exception: the solomillo (meat) was decent. And finally, the dessert was not only totally insipid (a coffee mousse) but the presentation was very poor too. In addition, the atmosphere and ambience were not at all what I expected. It made me sad. The restaurant is located on Alberto Alcocer, a street whose part closer to Castellana is completely different to that where Dogma is; an unattractive area to walk around.

We ordered the octopus salad, grilled monkfish and codfish with pilpil sauce. The head waiter said codfish was not available and so changed to codfish in lobster sauce which was the bacalhau unknownst to us.. Minutes later he came back and said the monkfish is not available but the monkfish noisettes with prawns and garlic is available instead, saying that it was a Sunday and they don't get fresh supply. Now if the grilled monkfish is not available but the noisettes was that means it must have been from yesterday. Then we asked if they could do the seafood paella for one instead, after a lot of discussion in the kitchen they came back and said it was alright to do for one person. When the dishes were served, the octopus was not on greens but on potato salad, all the main dishes were so salty and the lobster paella was totally mushy and inedible and the lobster meat was powdery and not fresh, the whole dish was returned virtually untouched. They tried to offer us champagne when we didn't even order wine because we had too much drink already.

Our host was Jonathan and he took exceptional care of us for the whole evening. Food was excellent and was delivered exceptionally quickly. Be warned, Pizza would feed 2 as would the pasta Bolognese. Wine options were also very good and the whole deal was very reasonably priced. ‚Ç¨79 for a bolt of wine, 3 main courses, water and a desert. I would highly recommend Malafemmena if you‚Äôre in the mood for some good Italian food in an excellent setting and ambiance. Only one suggestion, If you could provide oil and balsamic with the bread before the meal it would add to the authentic experience. And 1 idea, our local Italian back home serves a mascarpone and Nutella calzone with vanilla ice cream as a desert. I think it would be a great addition to the menu. Thanks again for a great evening.

We were shown to a table and instantly the environment and good air conditioning made us feel at ease.   Despite being the only customers, we were looked after attentively by multiple friendly staff members. Food and cocktails were amazing. We had paella and a Spanish casserole.  We were even more astounded that despite the high class environment, that the prices were only fractionally higher than the street stalls outside l. We were given excellent service, apertif and breads and concluded that this restaurant represented excellent value for money. Staff were very friendly and we happily gave 20 euros in tips.

Drinks service was slow, and we had to keep asking for more drinks. The restaurant was busy, and there did not appear to be many waiting staff on duty. We mainly ordered fillet steak (i must point out that the steak was delicious) and one of the party ordered Paella. The steaks arrived - the vegetables and chips were cold, and had obviously been sat waiting in the kitchen? The sauce, whilst tasty, was gelatinous in appearance. The paella still hadnt made it to the table. Infact, we had eaten our main course by the time it arrived. The paella was very disappointing- it tasted ok, but comprised of rice, calamari and perhaps small clams or mussels? Not a single prawn, not a single king prawn. We informed the waiting staff, and the paella was not charged for on the bill. The only other good point was the quality red wine which was recommended.
