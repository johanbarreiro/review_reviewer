Luckily, the super-pleasant Roberto (the main dining room manager), offered us a dinner at the elevated tapas/bar tables. So we had a drink and coffee (arguably the best we have tasted in Madrid!), and Roberto patiently, and professionally answered our menu related questions. So finally it was food time. After some delicious fresh bread, with very tasty olive oil, Tomas, our greatly attentive, and professional server, got us some grilled goat cheese over apple jam, and mixed greens salad. Just awesome! Two of us shared the 1 kilo of T-bone steak, medium, served with roasted potatoes. I heard the sirens sing as I brutalized the steak, as did my companion! It was so good, I am drooling just telling about it Our third companion had the grilled Hake, that came with some vegetables, and got extremely high reviews for taste, aroma, and presentation.

He gave us suggestions on our food orders, and rightly prevented us from over ordering because all the dishes seemed so yummy. We tried the chicken curry, the steak mignon, the tomato soup, and the salmon skewers. All super yummy. The sangria was really nice too. We really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere which prevailed in this little Taberna el Sur. Jonne even played a tune on the guitar to entertain some small kids at the next table. Wonderful experience!

We sat at one of the outdoor tables on the sidewalk underneath an umbrella. The waiter congenially informed us that we could order tapas that did not involve anything being cooked, as the chef would not return for some time. So, we ordered and enjoyed two very nice tapas; one with “macerated” chopped tomatoes on toasted bread, and one of Iberian ham. The tomatoes on the first dish were truly excellent. They might have even been more flavorful than the tomatoes I grow in my garden at home. Of course the jamon was delicious and was presented in an interesting way (photo). We sat and sipped our beverages for long enough that we were there when the kitchen opened. So we decided to order a couple of plates that we weren’t able to order earlier. One was “special” anchovies tapa, the other a salad with “apple jam and fried goat cheese.” The special anchovies were very large fillets, apparently from somewhere specific, and were quite good. They were swimming in good olive oil and were enjoyable to eat with the crusty bread served alongside. I’m not sure I’d order this again, but we wanted to try something “special.” Meanwhile, the salad was absolute genius; a nice mix of greens with the incredible combination of the cheese and the “apple jam,” which tasted more like pear and made an incredible foil for the fried rounds of goat cheese. These rounds were larger in diameter than typical goat cheese, sliced 3/8 inch thick, and caramelized to a light brown crunch on the exterior, while remaining creamy in the center. Sublime. Overall, a very casual and memorable dining experience…",2016-07-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or630-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_19822,0.005,0.894,0.101,0.9782,0.2926754385964912,0.5923767752715121,0.39408,1752,136,0.0776255707762557,0,38,False,67,0.1,0.2,0.36,0.1,0.14,0.02,0.04,0.0,0.04,0.0,304,194,4.766447368421052,0,0,arriv earli kitchen open dinner servic visit previou trip madrid enjoy want return sat one outdoor tabl sidewalk underneath umbrella waiter congeni inform us could order tapa involv anyth cook chef would return time order enjoy two nice tapa one macer chop tomato toast bread one iberian ham tomato first dish truli excel might even flavor tomato grow garden home cours jamon delici present interest way photo sat sip beverag long enough kitchen open decid order coupl plate abl order earlier one special anchovi tapa salad appl jam fri goat chees special anchovi larg fillet appar somewher specif quit good swim good oliv oil enjoy eat crusti bread serv alongsid sure order want tri someth special meanwhil salad absolut geniu nice mix green incred combin chees appl jam tast like pear made incred foil fri round goat chees round larger diamet typic goat chees slice inch thick caramel light brown crunch exterior remain creami center sublim overal casual memor dine experi,good review,4,Spanish

The decor was elegant, the staff were attentive and informative without being stuffy. We had the experience menu which was great fun and really showed the artistry and skills of the chef without compromising on flavour. This 20 course meal with accompanying wine was sensational. Ramon took our taste buds on a world tour. I particularly enjoyed his nod to his Catalan roots with a menu containing ingredients from Vic and the butifarra.  Although I do love the food and cosiness of the Kitchin in Edinburgh but having eaten in a few Michelin places in Europe this has to be one of the most technically skilled and interesting menus I've seen. Possibly the best one I've been to. The flavours of the dishes were varied from delicate to very rich and the wines chosen really surprised us and perfectly suited the flavours of the food.  A nice touch is that Ramon comes to meet each table to talk about the menu. A wonderful place and a great experience and I hope We get the chance to return again.

The sangria that my husband chose was a particular hit. I would stop in if you are in the area - you can take advantage of the free admission to Reina Sofia and then have a nice dinner. There are a couple of tables outside, but there is an extra charge for these.

The dining room is compact and there are not many tables but there was no lack of atmosphere. The room itself is beautifully decorated and we found the service to be very good indeed - cool, professional and efficient but not stuffy. We had the 20 course tasting menu and it was quite an experience! I'm pleased to say that we loved almost everything. As one might expect, several of the dishes are very inventive indeed and presentation is as important as flavour. Snr Freixa himself took the food order and returned later in the evening to see if everything was OK - it was a nice touch.

We had arrived early that morning via overnight bus and were hungry and tired when we headed out from our hostel.

The waiter did not speak English, and as we did not speak Spanish, we tried to communicate with hand gestures. In a few moments, the waiter excused himself, and the chef (who spoke English) came out to converse with us. We were served and waited upon by him for the rest of the afternoon.  We ordered a meal of the day, along with a margherita pizza. As part of the meal of the day, I chose a caprese salad (which was not originally included in the options, but since I am vegetarian, the chef agreed to serve it to me), the olivia pizza and a glass of red wine.

As the outside restaurant area was full, we got a table for two in the actual restaurant downstairs which was very cosy and comfortable place to eat. Service was excellent and our waiter spoke very good English. The reason I'm giving only 4 out of 5 stars is that all the food we ordered (goat cheese salad, chorizo and a little pincho presa iberica as a side dish) came to the table at different times. I got my salad first when my aunt still had to wait for her chorizo, and when we had both finished, the waiter brought the side dish to the table.

It starts always great with the bread offered..... As a german citizen you might suffer with bread in Spain. Well not here, the bread brought in freshly from Ramons father is just amazing. My favourite in Madrid. I have read complaints about the restaurant being pricey. The opposite us true compared to very other big european city. Trust the young sommelier , he is among the best in Spain..... Challenge him and trust him...... Today only spanish wines but i do not feel like drinking a Verdejo or Albariño...... Offer ne sth different..... The sommelier will not disappoint you.... It is right there is no view from the restaurant, however there is a small garden. Look on the creations on your plate. They are besides great and delicious always an artistic eyecatch. Finest european glasses ( Baccarat etc) and stoneware ( Hermes etc) are the rule. Atmossphere however is not royal but funny and relaxed. Everybody just wants you to enjoy the food. And it is easy to enjoy it.......the only thing that could be a little better are the deserts.

The only availability was at 9:00pm. On the evening of our booking, we turned up and were told that there was no table for us. We were utterly surprised to hear this. The staff in reception then told us that an email message was sent tout at 7:00 pm to let us know that there was no availability. How on earth could they possibly expect their customers to check their email only 2 hours before the time of their booking? Did they not take into account that people have to get themselves ready, then have to travel somehow to the restaurant? Upset and frustrated, especially when we didn't know where else to go for our meal, we were about to leave then they told us that some one didn't turn up for their table and that they could give us that table. The mess-up, however, was made up for a rather excellent meal. What was most impressive was that Ramon Frexa himself waked around to greet his customers and took the orders himself. He then walked into the kitchen to work on the food. As the restaurant is not large, and the number of tables and diners limited, the service was very personal with many special touches. The food was amazingly innovative and was so beautifully presented and was full of exquisite flavours. Some of the courses were not simple dishes but unfolded in several 'acts', each one was a surprise for the mind, the eye and the palate. We ended up having a great experience at this place, to which we shall return. But we will check our e-mail inbox or ring them before we set off. Better still, we will be cautious and will also book elsewhere in case there is no table for us.

After looking in trip adviser we found this little place. Upon arrival we was greeted by our waiter Enrique who was everything you could want in a waiter. He was polite and helpful and very attentive. I can't praise him enough for his service. We had a stater of mixed chorizo and cheese and it was lovely. We then order a paella ( $29- brilliant value) and it was beautiful, the king prawns tasted like they had just been pulled from the sea. Best paella I've ever had. Throughout our meal we was given little tapas and at the end a little dessert.( non of which we was charged for) We ordered a bottle of wine from a winery we had visited earlier on in the holiday, and it was decanted and poured for us.

Some guests are next to stage for those who choose beverage and show. The dinner guests were seated one off the stage and a little better seat/ perspective. They offer a dinner menu with points for each item to choose from. Couples who are sharing can order several items for the allowed points. We chose chicken paella, Iberian ham, manchego, vegetable salad of red peppers and desserts were included too. Two glasses of wine or one alcoholic beverage per person. The food was good but the show was great. It starts out a little show but they increase the intensity as they perform.

The sign to the right of the door was filled with photos of niños y niñas. And a one table sat four children, with the five adults at an adjacent table. After asking for menus in English, I ordered the tuna belly salad, a great combination of tuna, tomatoes, pepper, and beans with olive oil. My Bride ordered the bonito. Neither plate was empty when dinner was served, as the portions were more than enough to satisfy two hungry travelers. The fifth star was earned by one of the adult men, who communicated with broken English, French, and Spanish, offered the Bride a glass of wine from his bottle. The verdict was the house wine was good, but his was far better. When his supper was finished, we hugged him in thanks.

The service by Alex and Johnny, is fast and energetic but not pushy. The food comes out fast and is tasty. Our meal which included salad, main courses, dessert, bottled water, beer, excellent glass of Rioja red wine, coffee and liquor, came to the ridiculous price of 38 Euros.

The 15 euro/person price of the flamenco show, including a drink, was too good to resist, and the place was so inviting and cozy. The show itself (consisting of a guitarist, a male and female dancer, and a female singer) was one of the most enjoyable flamenco performances I have seen! (And I've seen several, in Madrid and in Seville). The performers were full of joy and enthusiasm, and had wonderful rapport. They even invited the audience to sing along with some of the songs, which was great fun! The staff at the restaurant were also super-nice. I will definitely come here again, and bring friends. I just hope that they don't raise the price and become like the other commercial, over-expensive tablaos that abound in Madrid!",2014-01-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3847118-Reviews-or370-La_Taberna_de_Mister_Pinkleton-Madrid.html,UID_20024,0.0,0.762,0.238,0.9919,0.2918449197860962,0.4093137254901961,0.4079125,889,76,0.0854893138357705,3,31,False,27,0.1555555555555555,0.2,0.2888888888888888,0.1333333333333333,0.1777777777777777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0222222222222222,0.0222222222222222,155,107,4.741935483870968,0,0,roam around area one weeknight friend visit husband live madrid walk mister pinkleton chanc euro person price flamenco show includ drink good resist place invit cozi show consist guitarist male femal dancer femal singer one enjoy flamenco perform seen seen sever madrid sevil perform full joy enthusiasm wonder rapport even invit audienc sing along song great fun staff restaur also super nice definit come bring friend hope rais price becom like commerci expens tablao abound madrid,good review,4,Spanish

My wife and I were on a month-long driving adventure through Spain, Portugal and Morocco. We ended our travels in Madrid. We were seeking an authentic Flamenco performance for our last night and our hotel concierge thankfully recommended this terrific venue. We were enthralled by a most impressive 2-hour show with a brief intermission. The theater is casual and intimate, so there isn't a bad seat in the house. About half the attendees were locals and the others tourists. Guests can choose the show with or without dinner service. We wanted to focus on the performances and were glad we decided on just cocktails (the first drink is included in the ticket price -- for two people with 2 cocktails each about 80 Euros with taxes ). This was not the typical canned money grab show for tourists. The performers were all consummate professionals and displayed a genuine passion for their art. I came to learn that most Flamenco in Spain is done by independent artists rather than traveling intact groups. Much like professional jazz musicians, each performer has attained a high-level of mastery and knows well the standard repertoire. The performances are often spontaneous and can even be without rehearsal. Wow, my wife and I were in genuine awe of the flair, speed and accuracy of the guitarist, the percussion, the vocals and of course the dancers. Absolutely amazing performances by all. A most impressive experience we will be talking about for years. Highly recommended.",2019-09-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3847118-Reviews-or20-La_Taberna_de_Mister_Pinkleton-Madrid.html,UID_20063,0.011,0.836,0.153,0.9887,0.2776436781609195,0.5878735632183908,0.3279176470588235,1530,119,0.0777777777777777,1,33,False,38,0.1129032258064516,0.1290322580645161,0.3225806451612903,0.0483870967741935,0.2096774193548387,0.064516129032258,0.0161290322580645,0.0161290322580645,0.032258064516129,0.0483870967741935,255,169,5.003921568627451,0,0,truli one memor even madrid wife month long drive adventur spain portug morocco end travel madrid seek authent flamenco perform last night hotel concierg thank recommend terrif venu enthral impress hour show brief intermiss theater casual intim bad seat hous half attende local other tourist guest choos show without dinner servic want focu perform glad decid cocktail first drink includ ticket price two peopl cocktail euro tax typic can money grab show tourist perform consumm profession display genuin passion art came learn flamenco spain done independ artist rather travel intact group much like profession jazz musician perform attain high level masteri know well standard repertoir perform often spontan even without rehears wow wife genuin awe flair speed accuraci guitarist percuss vocal cours dancer absolut amaz perform impress experi talk year highli recommend,very good review,5,Spanish

As we walked in I looked around to see what others were eating. It looked like everyone was having something different. We sat down and I examined the wine list. It had a variety of moderately priced wines that I knew were very good plus a few expensive bottles. I was thirsty and when I saw the people at the next table drinking tall cold beers, I decided that beer was right for this meal. We started with the fish ceviche. One of my buddies from grad school is Peruvian and her dad made wonderful ceviche. This was even better. It was the best ceviche that either of us had ever eaten. The ceviche had a choice of spice level and we chose ""medium"", without really knowing what that meant. A small bowl of the spicy liquid came along side and, in moderation, added a terrific flavor. A good start to the meal and a good match with the beer. For our main course we split a potato thingie that was not fried and had some good stuff on top. We also had the fried mixed seafood which came with octopus, shrimp and a bunch of relatively mild white fishes. And hunks of what I think was yuca. Excellent! Not at all greasy and full of flavor. The servings were large and we split the three dishes and had no room for dessert.

We struggled a little as there was so much choice on the menu and we ended up choosing a couple of meals that were not quite what we expected. A word of warning - some items on the English menu were listed as peppers but were mixed with green chill is which were astonishingly hot so be aware. We had a lovely table but was a bit too quiet downstairs as very low music level - I know this is something that not everyone approves of but being a bit louder would have lifted the atmosphere. We did have some very good meals - one of the standout ones being the hake for a main course plus one of our party had white chocolate brownie which was lovely. Perhaps try the Manchego cheese for dessert - you get lots and goes down well with lovely red wine. Personally we had a better meal elsewhere in Madrid but a table for 6 on a Saturday night is a little tricky to find and pre- book. We may had a a bad night - there was a hen party in too round the corner so perhaps that was why the service was a little sluggish too,2016-09-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or590-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_20160,0.072,0.791,0.137,0.9672,0.0947633744855967,0.3947736625514402,0.5854999999999999,1100,115,0.1045454545454545,0,13,False,49,0.1290322580645161,0.1451612903225806,0.2419354838709677,0.0967741935483871,0.1612903225806451,0.032258064516129,0.0161290322580645,0.032258064516129,0.032258064516129,0.1129032258064516,221,130,3.981900452488688,0,0,ate restaur last night local hotel good review struggl littl much choic menu end choos coupl meal quit expect word warn item english menu list pepper mix green chill astonishingli hot awar love tabl bit quiet downstair low music level know someth everyon approv bit louder would lift atmospher good meal one standout one hake main cours plu one parti white chocol browni love perhap tri manchego chees dessert get lot goe well love red wine person better meal elsewher madrid tabl saturday night littl tricki find pre book may bad night hen parti round corner perhap servic littl sluggish,good review,4,Spanish

We had one of those meals here. Our table was in the vaulted downstairs dining room surrounded by original brick walls and hooks from which hams were once hung to dry. The area is small but not crowded with plenty of space between the tables for privacy. The upstairs bar has many hams hanging and there's a good size charcoal grill there too. Like much Spanish cooking the presentation is quite simple but it's the quality of ingredients and care in cooking that shines through here. We had the Iberian tapas to start and the acorn-fed pork for main. All of this, and the desserts which followed, were delicious. The staff were attentive and helpful without being pushy and seemed genuinely keen that we should have the best possible experience. We chatted with the owner, the son of the parents who established the restaurant in 1962, before we left and his enthusiasm for the quality of what he offered to guests was apparent. I'm sure you could find restaurants with (perhaps) finer dining, a more impressive location, or whose staff spoke perfect English, but I think for a great meal in Madrid you'd be hard pressed to find something better than this for a memorable Spanish dining experience.

We ate in a 200 year old meat cellar downstairs. Staff were incredibly professional and friendly....decent command of English. Calamari was perfectly lightly breaded and served fresh and hot. Ceviche and scallop salad was delicious. T-bone was extremely tasty and juicy. We had this cream cheese dessert which was insanely tasty. Waiter recommended a nice bottle of red wine. The entire meal cost around $120 which I regard as good value for money in a top end restaurant. I will definitely come back here any visit to Madrid. I promise you won't be disappointed.

It was a quaint place with room for about 50 people. The tables were very close to each other but it was too bad. We were served drinks and two little bowls of snacks. ( Our drink came with the ticket price) The wine was ok but maybe you could have order something better as I saw a small bar area. We did not go to the dinner show so can’t review that. The performance was good but if you’re not fluent in Spanish forget understanding what they are saying. The performers that did speak spoke so fast we couldn’t even catch one word. I guess words don’t matter when the story is told through dance and song. The dancers were entertaining, singers ok, and the guitarist was very good. We spent more time watching his finger work the strings then the dancers. I wish there had been more of a variety in dancers. The two that did dance were good but I’m sure there are many more personal styles. It’s worth the 30 euros for a couple hours of entertainment.

The restaurant has some tables outside on the street with two dining rooms inside downstairs. If we hadn't read about it we probably would have passed it by as it didn't have any menus on obvious show outside. The restaurant was really close to our hotel which was on the Plaza Oriente, opposite the Royal Palace. We booked a table through Trip Advisor in the cave dining room. The dining room is atmospheric and small seating only 18 people and we were really pleased with our choice. The waiting staff were very welcoming and polite .They gave advise on the menu and drink choices and were very knowledgable about the dishes and ingredients. We had bread and olive oil, a Main course and dessert each with a jug of Sangria and bottle of water and the bill came to 69 euros which was very reasonable for the quality of food. It felt like fine dining on a mid-range budget. All the food was beautifully presented and delicious..we left nothing on our plates! The toffee pudding was recommended by the waiter and was absolutely divine. This is a real gem of a restautant and we would recommend to anyone.  We found it a lovely way to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday.",2017-09-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1511527-Reviews-or420-Meson_Restaurante_La_Mi_Venta-Madrid.html,UID_20275,0.0,0.851,0.149,0.9893,0.2034166666666666,0.4681666666666667,0.2745833333333333,1279,116,0.0906958561376075,2,22,False,52,0.0869565217391304,0.217391304347826,0.3695652173913043,0.0652173913043478,0.217391304347826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0217391304347826,0.0217391304347826,231,148,4.536796536796537,0,0,visit la mi venta celebr birthday read review trip advisor glad restaur tabl outsid street two dine room insid downstair read probabl would pass menu obviou show outsid restaur realli close hotel plaza orient opposit royal palac book tabl trip advisor cave dine room dine room atmospher small seat peopl realli pleas choic wait staff welcom polit gave advis menu drink choic knowledg dish ingredi bread oliv oil main cours dessert jug sangria bottl water bill came euro reason qualiti food felt like fine dine mid rang budget food beauti present delici left noth plate toffe pud recommend waiter absolut divin real gem restaut would recommend anyon found love way celebr husband th birthday,good review,4,French

From the guitar player to all the dancers and singers. I loved it was not a quick show and we really enjoyed ourselves.

I chose this restaurant because of the reviews on here and i'm pleased to say, it did not disappoint!!  We dined in ""the cave"" - the whole feel of the place from the minute we arrived to the moment we left was fantastic. The service was absolutely impeccable - Carlos, the waiter - helped us with things we didn't understand on the menu, and spoke perfect English (which was good for us because we speak very little spanish). When we ordered our wine, he gave us its history and told us all abut the flavours we could expect, he also did this with the oil for the bread - i've never seen a man so passionate about oil, Haha! He also had a really loud, arrogant customer on the next table which he handle very very well!  The food was lovely, i had the Sea bass and my girlfriend has the Hake, both came with veg which was roasted to perfection. We tried each others and both agreed they were fantastic.

Even though the place was packed when we got here, it only took about 5 mins for us to get a table. This was great, especially because there were 2 groups of people in front of us waiting for a table as well.  The place is quite small, but it has a great atmosphere. We enjoyed every moment of our lunch there. The waiters were very helpful and we went along with their recommendation for a red wine, which paid off.  For food, we got a tuna tartar to start with, and it was absolutely delicious. After that, we got the grilled octopus, beef secret and chicken curry. Everybody was more than happy with their food. We all tried all the food on the table and agreed that everything was just delicious.  We were unable to order some dessert as well because we were full, but I wish we could, we would have certainly been impressed.

Not being familiar with Spanish wines, we asked for advice, and had a delicious rosé.  For starters we had the anchovies (from the north coast, and delicious), and the grilled green peppers. The peppers were an enormous serve, we couldn't finish them.  Meat is their specialty, but we opted for the paella. It was very good. My only critiques would be there wasn't a single pipi (clam) in any of the shells on my plate (or within the rice) and the paella was almost cold by the time we got to it. I think this was as the waiter served it from the pan onto plates for us, this took some time, and the plates used were cold. I'd suggest they need to serve it onto warmed plates to help retain some temperature.  We had the Gin and Tonic sorbet for dessert which was delicious.  Certainly worth going, we booked online and scored a great table downstairs in the old curing room. Thanks to all the staff.

Acorn fed pork is so good and it even taste like a different meat: boar or beef and very lean. I heard T bone steak, lamb are also good. Fried calamari is so so as they do not do seasoning before frying. Also it could be Spanish style and they don't fry until crispy. Really big portion though. But be careful with salt as this restaurant tends to decorate with salt (may be to remind us that it is originally ham making business), they even gave extra bowl of sea salt too.

We were drawn in by the fun name, and then learned that they have dinner/shows. There are three show times nightly, and we chose the first - at 7pm. I can't imagine how they do three shows nightly unless there are different dancers, because it was VERY high energy and passionate! Really fun, and not very long - so you get a good sampling of the music, dance, and singing while enjoying drinks and - if you want - food. We didn't order the dinner to begin with, but then decided to order some things off the menu. Tasty!  There was even an audience participation part of the show, where some ladies were invited up to learn a few moves.

I’ve also read reviews herein about the performers lacking “passion”, not true, these people were very passionate about the music and their performances. The guitarist was very, very good, and the guitarist is the backbone of a flamenco dancer’s performance. The main dancer was very good, she was lithe and sinuous on the dance floor and really made the performance entertaining for everyone.

Mas al Sur was just about a mile walk from our hotel and easy to find with google maps. We were greeted by a very pleasant gentleman who immediately gave us a menu in English. We ordered the Sangria pitcher, and it was the best Sangria we had in all of Spain. The pitcher was filled with fresh blackberries and oranges, and perfectly seasoned over ice. Then for the three adults, we split the Mediterranean salad, pork Rojas, beef tenderloin, and seafood paella. This was so much food, but absolutely delicious. Hands down the best paella in Madrid.  For dessert we split a very decadent piece of cheesecake with blueberries and had three shots of Baileys. The walk back to the hotel was very much needed!

Although we had sampled tapas all over Madrid and were not terribly hungry when we arrived, we devoured the Padron peppers, ham croquettes and the chorizo from hell, aptly named and flaming hot. With Javier's suggestion we had the ""secret meat"" dish which was the most delicious pork we've ever had. We also enjoyed the grilled vegetables and the green salad spiked with goat cheese and baked apple. Not to be missed. The meal ended with a sampling of homemade liqueurs, the best of which was the homemade Bailey's alternative that was much better than the original. the entire experience was outstanding, from the gracious and professional service to the food and all the way down to suggestions on where to go for a meal on a day trip to Toledo.

So a lot of the big restaurant were fully booked . We came across this on TripAdvisor and although it said it was fully booked on website we thought we would go in on the off chance we could get a table and we r so glad we did . We when at about 8 ish . To be honest you would walk past the place thinking it was just a bar but the restaurant is downstairs . The staff were very friendly and the food was top notch . We had read that it was a tad expensive but I disagree we had pinchos to start rather than a 'starter ' and it was enough . Our main course of steak / lamb chops were excellent and the desserts were to die for .

I was starving and this place looked promising. I’m SO happy we got to come here, it was quite busy but we were able to get seated fairly quickly at the bar (best spot!)— they offered us a table a few minutes later but I said the bar was fine :) We ordered the Tortilla de Patata comes with a really good white sauce (Must get!!), a Jarra de Sangria (delicious), Hamon Croquetas (comes with many! And my fiancé’s favorite dish) and the pork cheek dish (also must get!!)— the tortilla de patata and the hamon croquetas came out super fast! And so satisfying. Gustavo was so helpful and fun, he truly made our experience amazing! I sat in front of him drawing faces using chocolate sauce on plates for desserts. I laughed because the drawings were funny and creative. I asked if I can do one, and he said after I’m done eating! We both enjoyed the food so much, and had such a great time drinking and laughing. I was done with the food and ready to make a face!! Gustavo handed me a clean plate then the chocolate bottle. I originally tried to draw him, but didn’t account for the consistency of the chocolate and how hard it would be to control it (picture attached)— I did well my first try! And it made everyone laugh and it was cute :D — I thought he was gonna use it for some lucky table, but he gave us a delicious slice of passion fruit cheesecake!! If you love cheesecake, the flavor is delicious (I don’t like cheesecake but this is now my favorite!) Gustavo gave us a shot of some type of Madrid drink, which tasted like caramel.

Each of them were absolutely satisfying.

Probably the best meal thus far on our trip through Spain. The waitress who waited on us was very helpful, both in terms of suggesting how much to order and in helping with the gluten-free needs of a member of our party. Even after ordering, one of the chefs came out to make sure we had what we needed on the gluten free front. Then the food came out and it was all delicious. We had a curry chicken dish, a shredded flank steak, a spicey potato tapas, scrambled eggs and asparagus, a beef filet dish, and a pork dish. It was fortunate that they provided enough good bread to soak up the sauces with, because we didn't want to miss any of it. The restaurant is off the beaten path, but don't be deceived.

Since it is underground there is no cellular reception there, which is great in my opinion, since it gives you a chance to disconnect and just relax and enjoy the company :) We ordered a bottle of red wine, which was superb, and kept on ordering exactly what our waiter recommended.  Anong other dishes, we had the t-bone steak and the pork, both done to perfection.  It was my husband's 40th b-day, so the desert came with a candle, a happy b-day made of strawberry syrup on the plate, and a song from our waiter.
