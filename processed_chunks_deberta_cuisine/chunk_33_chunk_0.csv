For this very reason - you will have to book to avoid disappointment.  It is very elegant, with very well laid out dining tables, separate dining areas, private funciton rooms, and an open view kitchen/brasserie at the back. There is a small bar in the entrance for those who choose not to book.  Little details like the expensive crockery and cutlery, food served on warm plates, lighting that dims to give it a more private atmosphere, Dim lighting and the excellent service are all positive traits that come to mind when I think of this restaurant.  The prices used to be unaffordable to most, especially when you want to enjoy their highly-reputed meat, but as of recent years' they've cut back a bit due to the hard times. They've even got a very good lunch menu at an affordable price. This shows that the demand for high-flying expenses have diminished considerably in recent times, and so this place is really open for many more people. Starters are elegant and light, and the presentation is lovely too. Please try the Tomate, and the provoletta (melted cheese with crackers, this oen perhaps isn't so light!). The meat is the core competency of this place, which I've briefly described below, and the desserts are delicious. Try the Piña if you're feeling guilty, or simply let yourself go and try the ridiculously sweet panqueque!!! Ask for a Isla de Capri or Duquesa, which used to be my favourite dessert (no longer available but they somehow conjured one for us last time!). It is a profiterol with vanilla ice cream on top and a coat of melted chocolate and light custard - rather beautifully presented too. It is to die for!  The highlight of this place is the meat. Lomo Alto Fileteado, Chuletón, and Solomillo are all to die for. They use the best Argentinian meat and have it flame-grilled to your choice. The only added ingredient is salt, and I can say - hands down - that you will NOT eat better meat!",2013-01-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d795312-Reviews-or50-De_Maria_Calle_Felix_Boix-Madrid.html,UID_28412,0.073,0.783,0.144,0.9804,0.2380030692563937,0.5322356603207665,0.8440055555555556,2027,160,0.0789343857918105,7,62,False,67,0.1139240506329113,0.1518987341772152,0.2278481012658227,0.0632911392405063,0.1265822784810126,0.0379746835443038,0.0253164556962025,0.050632911392405,0.1265822784810126,0.0759493670886076,354,235,4.7175141242937855,0,0,de maria exclus restaur celebr footbal player wive dine regularli reason book avoid disappoint eleg well laid dine tabl separ dine area privat funciton room open view kitchen brasseri back small bar entranc choos book littl detail like expens crockeri cutleri food serv warm plate light dim give privat atmospher dim light excel servic posit trait come mind think restaur price use unafford especi want enjoy highli reput meat recent year cut back bit due hard time even got good lunch menu afford price show demand high fli expens diminish consider recent time place realli open mani peopl starter eleg light present love pleas tri tomat provoletta melt chees cracker oen perhap light meat core compet place briefli describ dessert delici tri pi feel guilti simpli let go tri ridicul sweet panquequ ask isla de capri duquesa use favourit dessert longer avail somehow conjur one us last time profiterol vanilla ice cream top coat melt chocol light custard rather beauti present die highlight place meat lomo alto fileteado chulet n solomillo die use best argentinian meat flame grill choic ad ingredi salt say hand eat better meat,good review,4,Spanish

It's a brand new restaurant only open for two weeks. I came to find it via a recommendation from top-rated Madrid restaurant Astor Gastro-place (No.4 on TA) just down the street. I tried to get in to Astor, but they were full, so I asked them for a recommendation, and they sent me to Cedron. A little hard to find, but right in between Astor and Plaza de las Carros. In fact, I had a view of the Iglesia de San Andrés Apostol, (St Andrews Church,) right outside the window from my table. It's my last night in Madrid after five nights, and I was eager to find a nice place for my last meal. A place with nice ambiance, good food, and a proper seat. As a solo traveler, I was tired of standing to eat, or sitting at what amounts to little more than a spice rack shelf to eat my dinner. What a wonderful find to be able to sit at a proper table! And nice music to round out the mood. I knew i was in a good place when the server described my perfectly pale glass of chilled Rose' to be the color of ""onion skin."" Yes, she gets it! I only had two things...the Eggplant Hummus with Pomegranate and Feta Cheese, and the Fried Cerviche with shaved red onion on top, but both were just lovely. A perfect ending to my visit in Madrid.

This restaurant is located in the financial district not too far from Bernabeu stadium (home of Real Madrid FC) and by the types of cars that people arrived in and the well-to-do clients, it was certainly a high end place! We arrived at 9pm as the restaurant opened, and we were given a prime table outside. Then the surprises began including a cold gazpacho to start. We ordered a bottle of Roija, blue cheese and walnut salad followed by steaks. We should have split the salad as each was big enough for 3 people, but every bite was delicious and the steaks (filet mignon and Ribeye) were grilled perfectly and were some of the best we have ever eaten! Between each course was a new surprise - amuse bouche, champagne, sorbet and more, all complimentary! Sharing some dessert, we were treated to free limoncello and pacharan liqueurs to finish off our night! We had a wonderful relaxed dinner at a very reasonable price (compared to high end steak houses in North America) and would definitely go back to De Maria on our next visit to Madrid! The valet even ran out to the main road to summon a taxi to take us back to our hotel- great ambiance, great food, and great service!

33124,33125,De_Maria_Calle_Felix_Boix,5,Positive,review_50903322,De Maria in Hortaleza - probably my favorite restaurant in Madrid,"Since there's no entry per location and De Maria has quite a few of them, I have to clarify up front - my comments relate to their Hortaleza location.

I've been also to both the Preciados and Correo locations, but they are a definite step down from the De Maria Hortaleza restaurant. Why so? Well for starters, the Hortaleza location is the newest and best looking of the bunch. The dining room is very large, with high ceilings so you never smell smoke from the smoking section. The lighting is great - strong enough that you can read your menu, low enough that you can relax and eat comfortably. The bar area in front is great for a quick bite also - quite a few nights I've been there for their special, and you can get in and out pretty quick. The grill is far enough in front that the restaurant is not permeated with the smell of smoke (something I cannot say about El Gaucho - yikes) But back to the restaurant part. Service in this restaurant is outstanding. Full disclosure: it may help that I am argentinian and I can connect with the staff (which is close to 100% argentinian). It may also help that over two years I went to this place at least once or twice a month (which I must admit, is the way to go - gotta love the ""glad to see you again"" level of service is still alive somewhere and that regulars are treated like special customers). But I've also seen them serve other tables around me and I've noticed the same level of service - courteous, never pushy, always suggesting or correcting if someone overorders or is not sure what they want, always quick with a complimentary sorbet at the end of the meal.  The meat is also very good at this location - both the ojo de bife and the entrana are very tasty. I've even had the asado de tira (which can be tough and greasy if not cooked well) in multiple occasions and loved it every time. Good provoletas, nice and crisp empanadas, awesome fries - everything is on target. You won't find a truer argentine parrilla in Madrid.  Bonus points: as a solo diner, I've never felt unwelcome, rushed or anything less than fully appreciated here (and I've done my share of sunday lunches at De Maria, traveling on my own, as well as plenty of solo dining all around Madrid). In a city that can be downright rude to solo diners in many, many places; this is a welcome find. When I brought business associates from the US here, they were always impressed as well (again, me being a regular helped that along, I'm sure) So, if you have a hunger for argentine beef and want to have a good experience head to De Maria in Hortaleza. Tell the maitre d' that the crazy argentine who used to lunch alone on Sundays on asado de tira and fries while reading a book sent you - who knows, it may help along ;-)",2009-12-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d795312-Reviews-or60-De_Maria_Calle_Felix_Boix-Madrid.html,UID_28447,0.039,0.721,0.24,0.9992,0.2769657029478456,0.5792605311355311,0.6116315789473683,2755,235,0.0852994555353902,0,82,False,97,0.1029411764705882,0.1470588235294117,0.2794117647058823,0.0294117647058823,0.1617647058823529,0.0441176470588235,0.0441176470588235,0.0147058823529411,0.1323529411764706,0.0441176470588235,516,292,4.337209302325581,0,0,sinc entri per locat de maria quit clarifi front comment relat hortaleza locat also preciado correo locat definit step de maria hortaleza restaur well starter hortaleza locat newest best look bunch dine room larg high ceil never smell smoke smoke section light great strong enough read menu low enough relax eat comfort bar area front great quick bite also quit night special get pretti quick grill far enough front restaur permeat smell smoke someth cannot say el gaucho yike back restaur part servic restaur outstand full disclosur may help argentinian connect staff close argentinian may also help two year went place least twice month must admit way go gotta love glad see level servic still aliv somewher regular treat like special custom also seen serv tabl around notic level servic courteou never pushi alway suggest correct someon overord sure want alway quick complimentari sorbet end meal meat also good locat ojo de bife entrana tasti even asado de tira tough greasi cook well multipl occas love everi time good provoleta nice crisp empanada awesom fri everyth target find truer argentin parrilla madrid bonu point solo diner never felt unwelcom rush anyth less fulli appreci done share sunday lunch de maria travel well plenti solo dine around madrid citi downright rude solo diner mani mani place welcom find brought busi associ us alway impress well regular help along sure hunger argentin beef want good experi head de maria hortaleza tell maitr crazi argentin use lunch alon sunday asado de tira fri read book sent know may help along,good review,4,Spanish

As lobster salads go, they were well executed. The main courses were rack of suckling pig (fair, forgettable) and veal shoulder.

The waiter carried 90% of the meal back into the kitchen, never asking if anything was wrong.

So we made a reservation for a dinner in Santceloni (located next door with the Hesperia Hotel at Paseo de la Castellana) with the degustation menu.  I cannot say anything about the food but original, marvelous, fantastic. No negative points in my case. The combination of flavours is so well balanced that feels simply OK, like the normal way it should be, amazing. I was expecting large dishes with little food and in fact, most of them were like that, like just a hint of heaven. I was expecting also to be hungry afterwards, but, honestly, not, I was not. Fish and duck dishes were served as small portions but acted as complementary dishes for this purpose of not feeling hungry. Hors d'oeuvre were so delicious that you could have a meal just with them. And I must admit that I did not like that much the cold tomato soup with oyster.  The service is, of course, correct. All personnel, waiters, sommelier, maître d', etc. are so knowledgeable about the whole experience of a dinner, choice of wines, champagne, breads, cheese, etc. that you really feel in good hands. The atmosphere is elegant, comfortable and modern. Little could be said about a 2 Michelin star restaurant that you could have not read or heard anywhere else. The experience is simply overwhelming. But paying the bill too. Honestly, the food is grandiose, but the price is so exaggerated that feels even offensive. Yes, you pay for original recipes; yes, you pay for experts at your service; yes, you pay for perfection in the kitchen, but the difference in price between 98% perfection in other restaurants and 100% in here seems posh.

We asked the receptionist who told us that it was closed! Finally she managed to call and tell us where to go and there, what a surprise! We found the best, friendliest and most efficient staff I have ever seen -by far, even for Starred restaurants benchmark. We chose the Gastronomic menu with the wine pairing (EUR 70) which I would recommend. The menu starts after 3 appetizers offered. Overall, I must say that all the dishes based on fish were above superlatives and the desserts were generous too. Not to miss for cheese lovers is the cheese selection (try the Spanish ones) which is amazing.

The whole experience is what you would expect from a 2 starred restaurant and I would not expect to write a bad review. All the staff have a distinct desire to give you the perfect dining experience. Each of my dishes was remarkable for the quality of its ingredients, the careful balance of its tastes and textures, the precise skill of its preparation and the painterly care of its presentation. A real experience for all five senses.  I would not opt for the tasting menu unless the entire table does so. It can becomes fussy and irritating for diners if not.  I can not wait to come back here.

It's attached to a hotel outside of the city centre. PROs: - Exceptional service! I'm not sure if it is because of it being a Michelin star rated restaurant or because my husband and I have been exposed to the impolite service we received in other average restaurants in Madrid! -There's a Metro stop one minute walk from the restaurant. -Beautifully plated food. It is truly like eating a piece of art! -Meals come with extra (very small portions) like amuse Bouche, appetizers, and plate of dessert. CONs: - It is away from the city centre. So if we wanted to take a stroll after dinner, there weren't anything nearby except a Metropolis full of buildings. - Quite expensive for the portion you receive. For example, I got the suckling pig for the Entree which costs €55 - on a plate were 5 square pieces of (mostly fat) meat 2"" in size each.  - Similar to my point above, everything cost money including bread - which by the way they will offer but won't say that they'll charge you. -Prices are not shown when handed the dessert menu. What we had was great. When we received the bill, they were €22 each. Overall, if you want to experience outstanding service (which is very very important to us), I would suggest to try this place. Be warned that it will cost you average €150 per person! Compared to other Michelin star rated restaurants we've been to, I would say this wouldn't top the list on value. I believe there should be a balance of artistic qualities and portion served.

When we arrived at 8:30, the bar area, which is rather small, was 3/4 full and teeming with energy. The crowd was a mix of middle aged couples and older folk, well dressed but not overly dressed, completely enjoying themselves. We ordered the house Rioja and the house Somotano red for 2.20€. Both were excellent young wines that were served with a tapa of cooked shrimp with some snails. Fantastic! The next round we tried the Ribera del Duero, which was also quite tasty, same price, and served with croquettes of béchamel and trufa. Delicious pairing! The service was very attentive and friendly.

We couldn't remember enjoying a steak cooked as well as it was done here (medium rare) in a very long time.

As others have said, its a local neighbourhood kind of place. The bar is bustling, noisy, and full of people enjoying the delicious tapas and cooling canas of beer.  But for the real deal head, struggle past the punters pressed against the left hand wall and go through the door to the back where a cosy, intimate and unashamedly old-fashioned restaurant serves top quality food at remarkably fair prices. Especially notable? The zabarinos (baby scallops); chick peas with prawn (more delicious and succulent than can possibly be done justice to in this review; the grilled turbot (rodaballo) ..in fact all the fish dishes are excellent. Be sure to try one or two of the desserts - the apple tart with ice cream is amazing - wafer thin with a lightly crispy base and an intense apple-iness that is irresistible.  Service is old school Spanish - very proper, very professional. somebody describes it here as ""self-important"" - I understand what the reviewer is saying but I think the main waiter just takes a pride in the great job that he does. And he does. Once you've finished eating, you'll never be rushed out of your seat - if you fancy staying for a nice long G&T you'll be able to relax and enjoy your digestivo.

Unfortunately, while the main course meat dish was the highlight, most of the other courses were far-outshined by the delicious amuse bouche offerings.

Granted, we dined there on New Year's Eve and most restaurants do fail to meet expectations on such highly anticipated occasions. But, the food was absolutely superb. What was troubling was the curious service that book-ended this most incredible meal. Perhaps the first problem was in part our fault. We entered the Hesperia Hotel to gain entry. After a bit of kerfuffle at the maitre d' stand, we were escorted by a waiter (who, by the way, was just as confused as we were) into an elevator and down to what could only be described as the basement. A musty funk brushed our faces as the elevator doors opened onto an unlit room scattered with furniture. We were polite, but the waiter spoke up. ""What is THIS?,"" he snarled as we groped our way toward the light. Out of the mist a hostess emerged and took over our tour. Civilization, at last!  The New Year's Eve tasting menu was really quite good. And the service was swift and efficient. Too swift. So swift we felt as if we were getting the bum's rush, especially after we had had our 12 grapes at midnight and paid our bill. Amazingly, we were hurriedly ushered up a heretofore unseen flight of stairs that led to street, entirely bypassing the Hesperia Hotel.  What was that all about?

What we can give feedback on is our experience of the quality of La Castela’s customer service, and specifically its professionalism faced with its error over our booking(see the backstory below) – of which inadequate, complacent, and the perhaps the worstexperience we have had with any restaurant in 25 years of international travel, is an entirelyaccurate review! In February we book a table for two people for dinner at 21:00 CET on Friday 18 March2016, as part of our planned holiday in Spain. On Monday 15 February we received an emailconfirmation of this booking from La Castela. At 16.54 CET on the day of our booking, Friday 18 March 2016, we received an email reminder and further confirmation of our booking from La Castela. We hurried back to Madrid from a day in Toledo, hungry and looking forward to a relaxingand leisurely dinner, and arrived at La Castela at 20:50 CET on Friday 18 March. On arrivalwe were first told that the restaurant had no record of our booking! Mistakes happen, and the measure of any good restaurant is how it recovers when faced with its mistake. In this instance La Castela was found entirely wanting. The senior waiter was dismissive, and quickly returned to eating his own dinner having not given our problem more than cursory attention. Another younger waiter then tried to help. Ultimately he found a booking for us on “Tuesday”, not the day or date on the confirmation we had produced asevidence of our booking for 18 March. And what did La Castela offer us; a table if we could finish our meal in an hour and vacate it by 10pm!? We declined this entirely unsatisfactory offer. As if to add insult to injury, at 21:02 CET on Saturday 19 March 2016 we received aninvitation from La Castela to provide a review of our experience on the preceding day translated from Spanish: 'We hope you enjoyed your visit to La Castela. It is very important for us to have the opinion of our customers. We are grateful to you very much for taking a moment and complete this brief survey.

They are from The Netherlands and enjoy in particular good raw materials, specially seafood, shell fish and vegetables. I selected La Castela following friends advice as well as it was chosen for Michelle Obama when she was in Spain in the summer of 2016.  And it was fantastic: it was just simple, well served, fresh and delicious food. We had razor shells, squid with onion and Tuna salad for starters. The tomato was astonishing as a very basic food but that can be boring and neutral taste. The shells were tasty and perfectly grilled and squid as soft and juicy as it can be. We then moved into a variety of monkfish, hake, turbot and lamb chops with salad and roasted potatoes as company. And ended with three deserts to share: rice pudding, apple pie and meillefoille with cream. Water and some white wine of Rueda.  We didn't fill heavy but pleased. Service was implacable and price to quality more than fine. Yes. We will definitely come back here and I absolutely recommend this if you want to taste a full and diverse range of the best food in Spain.

Every time, while visiting a new cities, besides the historical and architectural attractions, we always try to have a good food experience.  This time, during our trip to Madrid, we went to the Santceloni Restaurant. It was not voluntary choice, our hotel's concierge made us a reservation (so no Trip-advising before). However we knew that our dinner should be delicious, especially because it has been awarded 2 michelin stars. The Restaurant itself is very beautiful. All of us, we were charmed by it's deco, the choice of colors, furniture, etc. We were also welcomed warmly and during the whole meal the service was attentive to our needs and always ready to answer our questions. However at the end we had a slight problem with an unexperienced waiter, who instead of bringing us the right desserts (we actually pointed them in the menu!!), twice got us different sorbet flavors instead of wanted positions.  We decided to order ""a la carte"", so we tried different starters, fish plates, cheeses and desserts. Savory dishes were good, but they were not exceptional or very elevated. Peace of fish (of course I realize that it has the best quality) with a peace of carrot, morel mushroom or a foam. I actually expected more. Nevertheless the sweet part was amazing!! I saw a lot of obligatory setting up at the dessert section and so many different taste combinations. It was hard to choose, but each of us was happy with his plate and unwilling to share even a bite with the others.  I also would like to talk about their Sommelier. Sometimes, in the different restaurants the wine waiters seem to be very serious and snobby, creating kind off unpleasant atmosphere, but this guy here, not only suggested us a perfect wine, but also was ready to chit chat a little about his profession and place itself.  To sum up. I have to admit, that I saw ""more"" creativity on my plate in the small bistros than in this two star restaurant, but I also agree, that it is still a very nice place to go and have a good meal with your family or friends.",2013-07-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717403-Reviews-or110-Santceloni-Madrid.html,UID_19629,0.034,0.753,0.214,0.9978,0.2788994338994338,0.6298784548784548,0.598915,2085,172,0.082494004796163,4,63,False,88,0.1818181818181818,0.1948051948051948,0.2857142857142857,0.0649350649350649,0.1558441558441558,0.0,0.0129870129870129,0.0129870129870129,0.0649350649350649,0.0259740259740259,367,231,4.670299727520436,0,0,could say restaur everi time visit new citi besid histor architectur attract alway tri good food experi time trip madrid went santceloni restaur voluntari choic hotel concierg made us reserv trip advis howev knew dinner delici especi award michelin star restaur beauti us charm deco choic color furnitur etc also welcom warmli whole meal servic attent need alway readi answer question howev end slight problem unexperienc waiter instead bring us right dessert actual point menu twice got us differ sorbet flavor instead want posit decid order la cart tri differ starter fish plate chees dessert savori dish good except elev peac fish cours realiz best qualiti peac carrot morel mushroom foam actual expect nevertheless sweet part amaz saw lot obligatori set dessert section mani differ tast combin hard choos us happi plate unwil share even bite other also would like talk sommeli sometim differ restaur wine waiter seem seriou snobbi creat kind unpleas atmospher guy suggest us perfect wine also readi chit chat littl profess place sum admit saw creativ plate small bistro two star restaur also agre still nice place go good meal famili friend,average review,3,Spanish

Front of house is a tapas bar featuring the freshest seafood, which was very busy with local business people at lunchtime. We started with a glass of wine or beer which was accompanied by free dishes of fresh shell-on prawns before being shown to the table we had booked in the dining room at the back.

Tapas were brought in groups of two or three dishes, brought swiftly but timed to arrive just as we came to finishing the previous selection.

I will spending New Years Eve in Madrid with all my family. Being originally from Spain, and having been to the restaurant before during a business lunch, I decided to organize our dinner plans for that date at the wonderful restaurant at the Hesperia Hotel. We are a party of five adults, one 4-year old and one 1-year old. Given that we frequently visit highly rated restaurants and, therefore, know that different businesses have different policies, I carefully checked the terms on SantCeloni's website. Nothing seemed to indicate that children were not allowed or welcomed. In fact, this being the restaurant at a prestigious hotel in Madrid (and given the special date –New Years Eve), I simply assumed that, in light of the warmness culture of the Spanish, it was probably appropriate to bring my kids (otherwise well-behaved and little gourmands themselves).  I made my reservation through their website, making it clear that I had some children in my party. I tried to make it as soon as possible (8:00 p.m. or so), although only 22:30 p.m. was available. With much embarrassment, I immediately received a phone call letting me know that ""although children are not specifically prohibited, they are not welcomed in the restaurant"" ""they generally would not enjoy the experience"" and they offered a baby sitter during dinner.  I thought this was completely disappointing from a client point of view: 1) this is New Years Eve (a family gathering from a Spanish cultural point of view), 2) considering the numbers at our party, we thought they would make every effort to welcome us (perhaps by suggesting a separate area from the main dining room? –they do have such possibility), 3) we believe our kids have the same right to enjoy good food as adults have and teaching them how to do so at an early age is extremely important (was the alternative to feed them with pizza and leave them with an unknown baby sitter during the last day of the year???). Having been with my kids to numerous Michelin rated restaurants (including Sergi Arola's –whose brother personally cooked a tremendous seabass croquette for my son!) all over the world (and run by much more reputable/known names than chef Oscar Velasco), I can only say that this is not how a business should be run: the client (and his demands) should always be put first. Otherwise, it should be clearly stated on their website to avoid disappointment. I strongly recommend not going to this restaurant. A culinary experience should be one that meets all of the client's expectations, including having a clear sense on rules and, of course, trying to please the client.",2012-11-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717403-Reviews-or120-Santceloni-Madrid.html,UID_28498,0.046,0.858,0.096,0.9714,0.1295950216450216,0.4981008658008658,0.4898,2705,210,0.077634011090573,1,82,False,70,0.1022727272727272,0.125,0.3522727272727273,0.0454545454545454,0.125,0.0113636363636363,0.034090909090909,0.0454545454545454,0.1022727272727272,0.0568181818181818,457,275,4.914660831509847,0,0,write share disappoint polici restaur spend new year eve madrid famili origin spain restaur busi lunch decid organ dinner plan date wonder restaur hesperia hotel parti five adult one year old one year old given frequent visit highli rate restaur therefor know differ busi differ polici care check term santceloni websit noth seem indic children allow welcom fact restaur prestigi hotel madrid given special date new year eve simpli assum light warm cultur spanish probabl appropri bring kid otherwis well behav littl gourmand made reserv websit make clear children parti tri make soon possibl p although p avail much embarrass immedi receiv phone call let know although children specif prohibit welcom restaur gener would enjoy experi offer babi sitter dinner thought complet disappoint client point view new year eve famili gather spanish cultur point view consid number parti thought would make everi effort welcom us perhap suggest separ area main dine room possibl believ kid right enjoy good food adult teach earli age extrem import altern feed pizza leav unknown babi sitter last day year kid numer michelin rate restaur includ sergi arola whose brother person cook tremend seabass croquett son world run much reput known name chef oscar velasco say busi run client demand alway put first otherwis clearli state websit avoid disappoint strongli recommend go restaur culinari experi one meet client expect includ clear sens rule cours tri pleas client,bad review,2,Spanish

If you have the time for a smoke (the garden one) i swear you will have a great laugh just watching them run. We all have skin problems.. Most of us are stressed and some just want to see as much of the word as possible. I myself have an extreme psoriasis so I will say this. We entered the restaurant and were greeted by hostess with pimples all over her skin.  Like seriously all over her body (face hands all). You don’t want to eat after that. All I wanted was to call the next dermatologist and tell him I found a perfect experiment for him. First you think about that woman as a woman and you ask yourself a lot of questions. Not my cup of tea.  The food is sadly extremely overrated, out of the courses we had only 2 dishes were actually tasting.Or let me say out of the menu we kind of ate 2 dishes. We didn’t have one single surprise of anything we didn’t taste before.  For 130 euros each?! Really? + The rest .. a ttl of 500 euros for that  Come on. They think they are too good.. Question is at what.. Probably a stoned French who walked into that restaurant and said .. waaau the tables have a space of 2 meters from one to another the cheese table is huge , it’s a perfect room  But what the hell did he eat?  I am absolutely happy to provide the bill here and be contacted by whoever wants. The wine list is good (ok here he was right) tip the sommelier but really just for the wine you do not have to spend that cash. Go to a bar.

Prices are commensurate with a 2 star restaurant. If you take the grand tasting menu with the wine pairing (which we did) you will spend 240 Euros per person. You can order one of the 2 tasting menus or a la carte. The tasting menus are developed based on what is fresh and what your likes and dislikes are. We had the grand tasting menu and my wife & I thought it was superb. We saw something on the regular menu that intrigued us so we asked if it could be included and they obliged with no problem. You'll also get a long string of pre-appetizers, each very unique and exquisite in taste. Everything was seasoned perfectly. The one caveat is that despite the individual portions not being that large, 6 courses plus the various extras is simply too much food and if you eat all of it you will regret it. Similarly, we had the wine pairing which was excellent, however it was far too much alcohol. I strongly advise not finishing all of it unless you are comfortable polishing off an entire bottle of wine per person. The room and decor were quite nice.

We did not like the small table at the back of the dining room they gave the two of us (we had reservation) and they swiftly gave us a larger table in the main dining area. We also asked to change an appetiser after seeing what other tables were having (a tuna tomato salad) and they quickly checked if the kitchen had already prepared what we had originally ordered. Decor of the dining room is classic but not dated. The dining room is small but we did not feel cramped.  The restaurant serves traditional Spanish cuisine.

Very authentic, with full, hearty meals at a good price. And if you want picante, you can get picante! It's nice because they don't drown the food in cheese, so you can really taste the flavors. The atmosphere is simple and cozy but elegant, which is a nice change from the other candy-colored Mexican places. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and attentive.

We meekly obliged and then got called back up. We were seated in the right hand corner next to a window. So far so good. We were then studiously ignored by the two young madams who were masquerading as 'waiters' for about 25 minutes. We finally got a menu. then, after some time, some bread arrived. Meanwhile two 'suits' next to us were well into their main course (of a hearty five course lunch - we had plenty of time to observe and count).  We checked the underside of our shoes to see if there was any 'doggy do' which was keeping the staff away from us. No, all clear. We have no idea what the problem was. It just seemed incredibly rude and incompetent. Finally our orders were taken and our food arrived. But, where was the water and drinks? We waited while the food became cold. In desperation, one of us went downstairs to retrieve the floor 'manager' and to get some wine. We were very tempted to walk out. We are glad we stayed, because the food was exquisite. We enjoyed the food immensely, but the service was so awful, we couldn't wait to get out.

The best was kept exactly the same, though: the food. We had revuelto de morcilla (scrambled eggs with a typical Spanish sausage that has some rice in the filling) and a vegetable tempura. Both were the best examples of the respective dish. The down side is the typical disadvantages of going out for dinner in Madrid without a reservation: the place is always crowded, you have to be lucky enough to find a small corner on the bar, and eat standing with a fork and a napkin on your hand. It seemed like it was also possible to book a table, but the menu appeared to be different. Despite of the noise and the crowd, it is definitely worth it to visit Laredo.

When he opened in Madrid, we were pleased to see the great reviews. His excellence lives on here. There are rustic touches in the elegant and modern dining room reminiscent of Con Fabes that provide a nice juxtaposition to the glass and steel and iron foundational elements and the central and imposing colossal sculpture that dominates the main dining area. The service is top drawer- friendly, helpful, attentive, but not intrusive or cloying. In a word, perfect. The cuisine is modern and tres a la mode- explosions of flavor and unexpected constructs and forms. It is just plain fun to give yourself over to the chef de cuisine and the sommelier and let them make you dinner of their choosing with wine pairings that perfectly match the food. A great deal of the fun (and dining here is meant to be fun as there was much laughter and joy coming from many tables) was created by the sommelier who was so enthusiastic about his choices and expressive in his descriptions of the wines put before us. Indeed, this is an enthusiastic place- for your comfort, enjoyment and relaxation.

This was the perfect afternoon lunch spot to meet with friends. They had an amazing deal which included a drink, a tapa, your choice of hummus, and a dessert for €10, which is SUCH A GREAT DEAL. I know this deal is only until 2:30 I believe and I'm not sure on what days but it was so worth it. The hummus was warm and came with fresh baked bread and vegetables. Thinking about it makes my mouth water. I will definitely be returning!!!

They took us here and we were all sincerely pleased with the ambience, atmosphere, warmth, quality of food, quality of drinks and outstanding service at this place.  Usually I divide my reviews in pros and cons, but this place has no cons.  When you arrive there is a bar type of area, where people are having tapas, mostly standing. Very busy, but with good atmosphere. Tapas and entrees are really amazing. I'm pesquerarian so I couldn't try the jamon serrano but that looked really amazing and my colleagues loved it. The bread was also good, and the cheese was so tasty.  You will see lots of napkins in the floor! They say that the good tapas places in Spain are those were there are napkins there, so this one must be considered amongst them ;-) Once you are done with step one of the night, which is the tapas and drinks in that bar entry area, you may choose to go inside through a small door, where there have a proper restaurant, with spacious seating.  We ordered a lot of food to share. I had the rice with octopus and squid and it was simply delicious. Also I tried the lenguado some of my colleagues ordered and I found it awesome. Also the veggies with fried eggs were good, and overall everything I tried I found exceptional.  Wine was very good too!

The food was fantastic! One course wasn't exactly to our liking but was whisked away and replaced with something totally delicious almost seamlessly. The cheese selection is to die for!! It is displayed on a huge wooden table.  The only complaint we had was the sommelier. We didn't go for the wine pairing but I asked for a recommendation for a glass of red wine to accompany the cheeses. The sommelier never smiled, took an already poured glass over without discussing any options with me beforehand, told me nothing about it, didn't stay to see if I liked it (which in fact I didn't really) and off he went. That was a real negative point for such an expensive, highly rated restaurant. I think he assumed we didn't care or knew nothing of wine which was not the case. A real shame.

Evidently those mean nothing because I can tell you that every course except dessert made me gag. I started off with smoked mackerel that was chewy and could not have possibly been fresh. I spent the rest of the evening with a napkin stuffed with half-chewed mackerel in my suit jacket pocket. My main was sea bream which was also awful. I don't think it was fresh and the brown muscle was overbearing, possibly rancid and permeated the whole fish. I also got the tail end, which is the cheapest cut. Worse, it probably cost 50-60 euros. My wife didn't have as rough a time as I did but I asked her to rate her meal and she gave it a 4 out of 10. For these prices you should expect much more. Look, I can't explain the other positive reviews here but coming from New York City, and having eaten at other Michelin star restaurants here, this place was severely disappointing and probably the worst meal I had in two full weeks in various places across Spain. But forget Michelin restaurants in NYC where you can basically know you're going to eat well for the price like Del Posto, Babbo and many others: you can eat better than Santceloni anywhere where they have pride in the freshness of the food they serve. I routinely have better meals at home without having to pay $450 for it. Maybe you'll have a better experience than we did. Many people seem to enjoy this place. I will just tell you that the food was basically inedible.",2014-04-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d717403-Reviews-or100-Santceloni-Madrid.html,UID_26537,0.081,0.81,0.109,0.8639,0.0580667789001122,0.5470679012345679,0.4254,1501,136,0.0906062624916722,0,34,False,52,0.1153846153846153,0.1153846153846153,0.2692307692307692,0.0192307692307692,0.1538461538461538,0.0384615384615384,0.0576923076923076,0.0192307692307692,0.1538461538461538,0.0576923076923076,277,182,4.422382671480144,0,0,place brainer michelin star evid mean noth tell everi cours except dessert made gag start smoke mackerel chewi could possibl fresh spent rest even napkin stuf half chew mackerel suit jacket pocket main sea bream also aw think fresh brown muscl overbear possibl rancid permeat whole fish also got tail end cheapest cut wors probabl cost euro wife rough time ask rate meal gave price expect much look explain posit review come new york citi eaten michelin star restaur place sever disappoint probabl worst meal two full week variou place across spain forget michelin restaur nyc basic know go eat well price like del posto babbo mani other eat better santceloni anywher pride fresh food serv routin better meal home without pay mayb better experi mani peopl seem enjoy place tell food basic ined,bad review,2,Spanish

Arrived at around 1pm, the Tapas bar was quite full of people but the dining room inside was not opened yet. In the midst of a crowd we managed to get a table with two high chairs. The bar tender was very polite and helpful. Lots of seafood there - we ordered a few Tapas and the bar tender asked if we would like to have the ""cabarineros"" - the Spanish giant scarlet prawns. Lucky we ordered them - so delicious! If you are not a Spanish you don't have much chance to taste it and it must be more expensive outside Spain.  All the Tapas we ordered were presented elegantly and they were very delicious. A man next to our table asked my wife to come over and share his Tapas - some fried small clams which he said was unique in Spain. We started chatting and I guess this is the Spanish way of meeting people in Tapas bars. The atmosphere of the bar was excellent. The food was elegant. The price was reasonable.

Maybe a choice too quickly made after seeing this restaurant in Google and being in the area. When entering it becomes apparent that this is a place (even though located in a relatively new neighborhood of Madrid) that emulates traditional Portuguese restaurants like the ones you can find in Lisbon: traditional tiles (or imitations thereof, as the restaurant is not that old) on the walls; Portuguese paintings; dark wood; several plates, glasses and heavy tablecloth already on the table. Then you see an army of waiters; too many for the number of guests present. It reminded me overstaffed Brazilian restaurants, where most of the time the waiters were…waiting. As for the food, our impressions were mixed: the small starters and cod (bacalao) carpaccio was good; the bread was fresh; the cod (yes, this is a place that specializes in cod) with seafood rather mediocre: tasteless, not a little bit salty, not a little bit hot, nor the prawns tasting very fresh), and the uniform brown color of all its ingredients did not help either. The waiters did not seem to be in a good mood: we received short answers to our questions, no small talk or smile. In general, the food quality, quantity and overall experience was poor for what we paid (prepare 30-50 Euros per person).",2020-09-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1553154-Reviews-Tras_os_montes-Madrid.html,UID_28620,0.027,0.862,0.111,0.9639,0.1051728219696969,0.4625378787878788,0.5328857142857143,1510,115,0.076158940397351,0,45,False,51,0.125,0.1607142857142857,0.3214285714285714,0.0892857142857142,0.1785714285714285,0.0178571428571428,0.0178571428571428,0.0,0.0714285714285714,0.0178571428571428,253,171,4.972332015810276,0,0,chose restaur lunch without previou recommend knowledg like portugues food frequent travel portug brazil good codfish tasti gener portion mayb choic quickli made see restaur googl area enter becom appar place even though locat rel new neighborhood madrid emul tradit portugues restaur like one find lisbon tradit tile imit thereof restaur old wall portugues paint dark wood sever plate glass heavi tablecloth alreadi tabl see armi waiter mani number guest present remind overstaf brazilian restaur time waiter wait food impress mix small starter cod bacalao carpaccio good bread fresh cod ye place special cod seafood rather mediocr tasteless littl bit salti littl bit hot prawn tast fresh uniform brown color ingredi help either waiter seem good mood receiv short answer question small talk smile gener food qualiti quantiti overal experi poor paid prepar euro per person,average review,3,Spanish

We made an (early) reservation for 8 pm knowing that most restaurants don't open till 9:00 pm. The entire staff was so accommodating realizing that we were from out of town and really doted on our group of 11. We were a diverse group with folks from Taiwan, USA, Ireland, Italy and Great Britain so the language barrier was difficult at times but they worked with us. The food was amazing. The wine was delicious and the waiters were excellent. They kept our glasses filled and the wine coming! It's so nice to be welcomed with open arms in a foreign country and to see such tolerance for us as I'm sure we were not an ""easy"" group to deal with. :) Some memorable things to order if you go: 1) anchovies in tomato sauce, Iberian ham, Steak Tartare with avocado (just don't order it in Italian like I did (carpaccio) or you'll get gazpacho. Haha. My bad!), the cheese plate for dessert, and the list goes on! I don't think you can order a bad meal here. They even brought us specialty after-dinner shots for the group to try along with some complimentary desserts. The outside terrace is simply wonderful at night. The owner made a point of catering to us. It was a truly awesome first night in Madrid. Give it a try. Thanks to Restaurante Sal Negra for welcoming our diverse group with open arms.

The restaurant is pleasantly arranged, especially the terrace with a nice mix of gently modernised classical dishes and quite surely a rather good wine selection, which we could not really take profit of, due to the circumstances. A very nice touch for us was that a large number of the dishes are available as half-rations, which allows to sample more food even if you're not really hungry. Service was very good, although the waiter seemed slightly taken aback by us wanting to share a few half-rations for starters, which for us was perfect: as it left some space for desserts. The food was generally very tasty and the overall impression very pleasant, the price range was reasonable, for being in Madrid and this area, With just a bit more 'sparkle' in the main dishes - perfectly fine, but not outstanding - this would have been a five-star rating, which I give rarely.

The earliest you can get a table is 8.30pm and you know what? No real Spanish person is going to turn up before 10pm 2. You are going to need to embrace some broken Spanish (unless you are fluent) and that is a very good thing 3. It may be underwhelming from the outside but it is outstanding on the inside. Every dish we had was special.  Things you really need to try  1. The Iberian Ham 2. The herring with mango and avocado (yes your head says no but your taste buds will say Yes! Yes! Yes!) 3. The Galicia octopus 4. The sardine and tomatoes salad 5. The sorbets, either, the mint and mojito or the lemon. So fresh, bursting with flavor and the perfect way to end a warm Spanish evening. We were here on business but it would be equally suitable for a couple. Not so sure about families unless your children will eat more adventurous food and are used to being up late.

The space is an old hardware store (“ferreteria”) and it’s been converted into a trendy restaurant. The first room is like Harry Potter’s wand shop - wooden cabinets everywhere accented with all types of shiny hardware, half of the cabinets haphazardly open to reveal colorful bottles of liquor, and a tall wooden rolling ladder to reach them all.  The second room had an entirely different feel - a kitchen with an all-black theme and an antique-style stove. A man sitting at the counter there looked the part, with rounded spectacles, a satin vest, and a mustache like an old time train conductor. A huge modern-style painting hung on the wall behind some tall wooden slab cocktail tables. One room further, where we ate, had an angled wooden panel ceiling and narrow tall tables with glass display-case tops, revealing a treasure trove of hardware and metal trinkets and old receipts.  Every dish was perfectly executed: tuna tartare, octopus, the best croquetas we’ve had yet. And the crowning achievement was a platter of jamón ibérico that we watched being sliced from different sections, after which it was plated beautifully and served with an explanation of the flavors we could expect from each. There was also a pisco sour involved and a chocolate mousse that we all shared, and the whole experience was so sumptuous that it was painful to leave.  FYI - we came early before 8pm so it was easy to get a table without a reservation in their upstairs dining room, but be aware that they also have a downstairs dining room with a bigger menu and it would be wise to book that far in advance!",2019-07-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d15210699-Reviews-or20-Ferreteria_by_EGO-Madrid.html,UID_21601,0.01,0.904,0.086,0.9609,0.1783333333333333,0.4638095238095238,0.37233,1738,128,0.0736478711162255,1,35,False,36,0.1509433962264151,0.1320754716981132,0.2264150943396226,0.0754716981132075,0.1320754716981132,0.0377358490566037,0.0566037735849056,0.0377358490566037,0.0943396226415094,0.0566037735849056,304,199,4.7105263157894735,0,0,moment step insid obviou exactli kind place hipsteri thing seen yet spain space old hardwar store ferreteria convert trendi restaur first room like harri potter wand shop wooden cabinet everywher accent type shini hardwar half cabinet haphazardli open reveal color bottl liquor tall wooden roll ladder reach second room entir differ feel kitchen black theme antiqu style stove man sit counter look part round spectacl satin vest mustach like old time train conductor huge modern style paint hung wall behind tall wooden slab cocktail tabl one room ate angl wooden panel ceil narrow tall tabl glass display case top reveal treasur trove hardwar metal trinket old receipt everi dish perfectli execut tuna tartar octopu best croqueta yet crown achiev platter jam n ib rico watch slice differ section plate beauti serv explan flavor could expect also pisco sour involv chocol mouss share whole experi sumptuou pain leav fyi came earli pm easi get tabl without reserv upstair dine room awar also downstair dine room bigger menu would wise book far advanc,good review,4,Spanish

I had a few recommendations from some friends so I knew it was going to be ok, but I was not sure that was going to be enough not to disappoint my dad... We entered and the place is already surprisingly cool, we had some vermuts there and then we went downstairs to eat. A very nice waitress gave us a tour around the spectacular place, filled with art pieces. And then the magic: we ordered the ""Jamón experience"", I wouldn't call it a plate, that lovely Fernando created and walked us through it. Now seriously, I'm from Spain, I eat jamón very often and so does my dad, who actually has a little obsession with it, and this was nothing like we tasted before. There was maybe a surprise factor, but I don't think anybody would not be suprised by this. And then the cecina was awesome, the croquetas and the El Capricho meat were also very good, but man!

We drank a bottle of rosé cava and a bottle of water and total bill was 112€ which I thought was money well spent. The decoration is minimalist in tones of grey and black. Tables are fairly close together but everyone behaved themselves and ate fairly quietly: quite an exploit for Spain.   Service was friendly and generally efficient, although a bit quircky to start with. We were initially the only customers. When asked if we wanted an aperitive I said no, but I'd like to see the wine list straight away. The staff chatted among themselves and the wine list took well over five minutes to travel as many meters. The cava was duly opened and poured and we had started to drink it when two complimentary gin tonics turned up. Very kind, but we'd have preferred the GT's before opening and starting the wine!   The piped music was a little strange at first: modern crooner versions of songs that should have been left well alone (a remake of a Beatles hit in crooner style, I think it was"" Daytripper"", was particularly unfortunate). The restaurant filled up very discreetly and we had a most enjoyable evening, especially because the ""music"" had been turned down to a more acceptable volume (it was never blaring but nonetheless a little intrusive at the start). Customers seemed to be very happy with their choice of restaurant and food, leading to a nice ""warm"" ambiance. We didn't bother with a dessert as what we had eaten was quite enough...and we are enthusiastic eaters! The restaurant has an extensive wine list with prices for most pockets.

The place is very nice, modern and upscale (if not a bit stuffy). Most of the clientele were in business suits, and the wait staff mirrors that - they are very serious and professional. We split 3 beers (Kirin on draft), a large bottle of water, a seaweed & cucumber salad, the signature shrimp tempura, two rolls and two cups of coffee. A small plate of edamame was presented without cost. Everything was excellent, the shrimp tempura (though not typical) was amazing. The quality of their seafood is very high and the serving sizes are decent. I would definitely put this on our list of highly frequented restaurants if it wasn't so expensive. We spent 105 euro for our light lunch, but we could have easily spent twice that if we had ordered their recommended 'bar menu' and a bottle of wine. I'm glad we went and I would highly recommended it for anyone who loves Japanese food. Overall, it's a great place to go for a special occasion (or if your company is picking up the tab).",2015-02-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2446455-Reviews-or30-99_Sushi_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_2991,0.014,0.846,0.139,0.9836,0.2019206349206349,0.5360555555555554,0.2234454545454545,1145,96,0.0838427947598253,0,38,False,49,0.1538461538461538,0.1538461538461538,0.2307692307692307,0.0,0.1538461538461538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692307692307692,0.0384615384615384,209,140,4.483253588516747,0,0,want tri place coupl year knew would neighborhood weekday lunch made reserv websit place nice modern upscal bit stuffi clientel busi suit wait staff mirror seriou profession split beer kirin draft larg bottl water seawe cucumb salad signatur shrimp tempura two roll two cup coffe small plate edamam present without cost everyth excel shrimp tempura though typic amaz qualiti seafood high serv size decent would definit put list highli frequent restaur expens spent euro light lunch could easili spent twice order recommend bar menu bottl wine glad went would highli recommend anyon love japanes food overal great place go special occas compani pick tab,very good review,5,Japanese

As Spain is second only to Japan in fish consumption (and variety) it has a number of good sushi bars/Japanese and Japanese style restaurants, and the 99 Group is in their upper ranks. Their Maki sampler (2 pieces each of four different Maki rolls) is very well presented and an interesting, and attractive, variation on this traditional fare. The shrimp and vegetable tempura was perfectly done, as was the toro sushi. There is a good wine list, reasonably priced. We arrived around 11 pm on a quiet weeknight, and found the restaurant about half full. The service was prompt, but not pretentious.

They take classical dishes and give them a Spanish touch. The combination is sublime for my taste. It is quite similar to Kabuki in my opinion. We arrived early, and chose to sit in the bar, watching the sushi chefs work. I would recommend doing this, specially if you are 3 people or less, as it really gives another dimension to the meal, watching how they skillfully prepare the food. We started with the miso soup, which had some truffle on it. Very tasty. The usuzukuri was very interesting as well, as you could see the mixture of traditional sashimi and spanish flavors working really well. Then we had mostly nigiris. All of them were excellent. Personally, I really liked the sardine and anchovy combo, the butterfish with truffle and the scallop, but you cannot really go wrong with anything else. From previous visits I remember the tiger prawn tempura fondly.

We preferred to eat at the bar due to the great atmosphere, full of locals and hardly any tourists. This place is in Retiro park residential area and hence in a very nice neighbourhood.

We ordered 3 main courses with Tuna, fish and Ham with a bottle of their Rioja. For 15 Euros for the wine, it was very good.

But, we went inside and realized the restaurant was in the back and it is lovely and quiet. Unfortunately the waited told us he had no record of our reservations ... I had my confirmation and locator number but he kept telling me no... Then another waiter came over and said "" just give me 10 minutes and we will seat you"" ... He was true to his word, and I am so grateful because we had a excellent meal and time at La Castela. We ordered a great bottle of wine with our sautéed chick pea with king prawns ... Then we had a order of Sea Bream and Monk fish, both just perfect.  We had a lovely time, wonderful meal. So don't let the bar fool you... There is a lovely place behind the door!

However, hummus has never been one of them - until now! After trying hummus in both Spanish and Middle Eastern (and even Moroccan) restaurants as well as any kind of supermarkets, I had almost given up on finding a decent version of this dish in Madrid. Nevertheless, on a day like any other, I stumbled upon La Hummuseria entirely by chance. Based on my previous experience and seeing how the place was completely empty even at lunch time was not very promising, but my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try some of their hummus. Little did I know that it would completely blow my mind. From the first bite, I was hooked and couldn't quite believe my taste buds. This was the best hummus I had tried since I left the Middle East (which is indeed saying something). As if that wasn't enough, the bread that came with it was also pretty good. And, perhaps most surprising of all, was the fact that the staff were also nice, smiling and helpful (another rarity in Madrid). For this reason, I am absolutely certain that La Hummuseria will be able to revolutionize both food and service in Madrid. My only regret?

Our server Roberto, was the sweetest. He was funny but very receptive , and superbly efficient. We had a wine sangria ( cava ) and beer and both of them had a nice kick and tasted really nice.

It's been around a week since I ate at this hummus heaven and I still find myself day dreaming about the amazzzing food. A lovely little find, along a quiet street in the area of Chueca, my friends and I almost walked right past it. The design of the interior is bright and colourful which adds to the friendly atmosphere, along with the lovely staff members who went through the menu with us. My friends and I chose the menu of the day, which consisted of a homemade drink (lemonade/iced tea), a starter (we chose caramelised pear with rocket and goats cheese), hummus of your choice (garlic, chile/mushroom and more!) with warm pitta bread, and if that wasn't enough, a desert (I had homemade banana and chocolate cake with blueberries and raspberries). All for ONLY 10 EUROS!! Such a good value for the quality and quantity of food you get. Considering we had to take our deserts home in a box because we had no room left in our stomachs, says a lot!  I would recommend this lovelyy place to anybody (especially hummus lovers).

The menu is limited given the size of the place, but Giuseppe greets each table, explains what is best that day, and we listen to his advice, which ends up being some of the best Italian food we have ever had. The pasta and seafood is fresh, and Giuseppe is a maestro with sauces. He admits his tiramisu is not the best in the world, though it is the best is Spain, and I think he may be right. My family has eaten here around 5 times, mostly because of how good the food is, but also because of the vibe. It's like you are in the house of a couple for dinner. More than once we have had to shift tables mid-meal to accommodate another party, and others have done the same for us. When we order wine, it's red or white, not a carta de vino, but the wine is good! When it gets hectic Estella and Giuseppe have been known to spar with each other a bit, not unlike what would happen at my house! So, if you are looking for some of the best Italian food in Madrid, and like an intimate, casual and unique environment, and like to get to know the owners, this is a good place for you. A few words of advice, based on experience and other reviews. Make reservations directly, I use email, though whatsapp works, and confirm them. I know on one occasion they misplaced our reservation, but we were there early and they seated us, and another party who came in later could not be accommodated (I think there is a review out here from that person). Also, they really only can fit around 12 people max, maybe 2 parties of 4, and a party of 5-6 is tough to fit, so if you are that size, reserve much more in advance.

We went two of us for lunch, with an expectation to have roasted suckling pig. Upon arrival, around 1400, we were told that the suckling pig is not available, that one needs to order it in advance. Also the alternative lamb was not available for two, there was one leg of lamb only. This was disappointing for a restaurant that offers these delicacies as first and foremost on the their menu. When the one leg of lamb arrived on the table it turned out to be somewhat dry, with boring potato chips on the side. The other dish was pork chops which were tender and delicious.

The artichoke dish was fantastic - I believe it had porcini mushrooms and foie gras. Whatever the mix, all flavors went exceptionally together. The gambas al ajillo was great - the shrimps were a bit sweet (naturally, not from sugar) and very tender. The roast suckling pig was simply seasoned, but a very basic lettuce tomato & onion salad combined with it made these two dishes really come to life.

Best meal we had in our entire trip in Spain! I could go on about how every dish was so incredibly delicious, how the pasta was mouthwateringly fantastic or how we still talk about how amazing it was, but the best part was how proud the chef was of his food and it clearly showed. He came to our table to talk about the specials, his favourite dishes and to show us the fresh seafood brought in that day. We were entertained and amazed to watch him cook every meal from scratch in his kitchen. The meal was a true reflection of his passion and understanding for cuisine and unexpected combinations (pappardelle with salmon and strawberry pasta - amazing). Definitely get the mussels for a starter and truffle pasta for dinner. I’d fly to Spain just to eat there again.

We requested and received a table with a view of the kitchen. We were served a complimentary pre-meal ""appetizer"" and it was beautifully presented and delicious. For the first course we split the Bogavante Azul, a lobster dish, and it was delicious. For the second course we decided to split the Cochinillo (suckling pig). We asked for one dish to split but were served two separate orders. This is a misunderstanding that we could accept because perhaps the waiter did not understand my husband's Spanish, although he specifically said ""una ración para compartir"" (one portion to share). The cochinillo was surprisingly dry and the sauce that came with it was on the salty side and of insufficient quantity. This is no doubt Hortensio's version of cochinillo, and I must say my husband and I both much prefer the traditional style, moist and served in its own juices. One irritating thing was the fact that the wine server wiped off the top of the bottle with her bare hand after each pouring, and we observed that she did this at all tables. To my way of thinking this is an unsanitary practice. I would suggest that as we have observed at all other fine dining establishments they use a napkin to wipe off the bottle.

A fine air of anticipation for a lovely dining experience prevails! The chef trained in Lyon and chatted with us about our visit to Madrid. His tall toque represents his great skill in the kitchen. He manages to combine lovely sauces with the meats and poultry dishes of Spain. There is an open kitchen so it is possible to observe the great care that these beautiful dishes require.

They elect to remove your wine and water bottles from the table and pour when they see that you require a top up. This can only work where the waiting staff pay attention and we have been in some Michelin starred premises where we have to repeatedly ask a waiter for more water or wine. However, this was never a problem in Hortensio where the waiters were almost telepathic in their vigilance. As an aside, the napkins were the largest we have ever seen, verging on bedsheet size. As a messy eater I liked this. Now, the food - this was outstanding and delivered an intensity of flavour that we have seldom previously found. Every dish bore the hallmark of a chef at the top of his form - imaginative, creative and with ingredients of premier quality.

It's a small place on a side street, quite intimate, but works well for business, you can hear each other talk and you aren't TOO close to the next table.

The turbot was good but perhaps a little bland and for my taste SLIGHTLY overcooked (I'm being picky). The service was very deferential but inaccurate, they weren't 100% on remembering who ordered what.

The menu is focused on a few well conceived and executed dishes designed to give a Spanish culinary journey. We had an consommé infused foie open ravioli that was divine followed by a sea bass carpaccio that was flavorful and melt in your mouth. The main courses selections were squid, pigeon and lamb.

Hortensio is an elegant restaurant fitting for business and formal/important occasions with a nice atmosphere in a beautiful area of Madrid. Not a wide choice of dishes but those we tried were very well made, with a modern touch and a valid presentation. The chef (Mario, a young, modest and very gentle guy who also owns the restaurant) went around the tables to talk to the guests at the end of the service. We appreciated it. The bill was not for all pockets (around 80 euros per person for 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, 2 desserts and 4 glasses of champagne), which is a bit too high for what we had (65 Euro would have been more appropriate), also considering the average prices in Madrid.

The local is very nicely done, great brick walls nice wooden floors tables are impeccable. The service is good, I have had better and much worse. Food is good but not great, normally I would be happy but when you consider the price of the food, it throws me off. Personally I had the egg yolk with a corn souffle as a first plate, then I had the lb as a main. The egg was not at all special, heavy and the tastes did not blend well.

El Sainete is located in the building that for years was the Egyptian restaurant, El Faraon and since then has undergone at least 3 ""reincarnations""; all of them failing miserably. Lets make one thing clear immediately. This is a Mahou brewpub. That sentence alone will send a shudder down the spine of most self-respecting craft beer lovers. In Mahou's strong desire to get a foothold in that market they've bought stakes in Michigan-based brewery, Founders and Spanish brewery, Nomada. Of the 20 beers on offer, 10 are from those two breweries while the other 10 are rotated with guest beers. The beers that I've tried in two separate visits have been excellent. Clean, fresh and full of flavour. Cheaper than several bars in Madrid and certainly cheaper than in Barcelona. Expect to pay around €5.50-€6.00 for most American pint measures. The most disappointing aspect for me was the lack of other drinkers. And I mean lack. In fact, no one. Last Friday night for 2 hours I sat alone while 5 bar staff amused themselves and engaged in group thumb-twiddling. The same on my first visit, a Sunday evening. Many bars faced with this lack of custom would no doubt close down but Mahou have clearly put alot of money into this project installing digital beer menus that can be downloaded to a smartphone and downstairs a restaurant serving ""alta cocina"". I still harbour major doubts that the average craft drinker finds this kind of gastronomic adventure interesting. So all in all, a risky first toe-dip by Mahou into the brewpub market. In my opinion they've chosen a poor location with a history of failure and the food is not going to entice people like me who much prefer a good spicy burrito or pulled pork cob to go with a pint. I'm sure with Mahou's enormous resources this bar can cling to life longer than most but the early signs dont auger well.

Our waiter served everything with the exact timing we requested, and with a smile!! They gave us some ajo blanco (a white gazpacho) to start the meal and it was delicious. Indeed, everything we had was delicious. We first had Pluma Iberica which is a cut of meat from the black pig fed on acorns. You would not know the meat was pork. Tasted like beef, only better. The sauce it came with was also delicious. We then had Rabo de Toro--bull tails--only instead of being served with the bone, the meat was pared from the bone and then shaped into a pleasing circle. Again, the sauce was delicious. For dessert we had the souffle de Turron. Normally, we are not big fans of souffles, but this too was amazing. A great way to finish the evening. The wine we had was a Ribera del Duero--Hacienda Monasterio. Smooth and full bodied. We highly recommend it. To top the evening off, the chef came by our table and we had a very nice chat. He is an artist in the kitchen and a real gentleman. This restaurant is a must if you are in Madrid. Also, request a table near the kitchen so that you can watch the magic of the attention to detail and the precision that goes into preparing the dishes.",2016-10-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7686372-Reviews-or20-Hortensio-Madrid.html,UID_1025,0.006,0.851,0.143,0.9887,0.4279166666666665,0.6002898550724639,0.2621363636363636,1326,129,0.0972850678733031,4,43,False,49,0.125,0.175,0.375,0.025,0.175,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.05,0.025,246,158,4.394308943089431,0,0,husband dinner septemb restaur one michelin star three servic impec waiter serv everyth exact time request smile gave us ajo blanco white gazpacho start meal delici inde everyth delici first pluma iberica cut meat black pig fed acorn would know meat pork tast like beef better sauc came also delici rabo de toro bull tail instead serv bone meat pare bone shape pleas circl sauc delici dessert souffl de turron normal big fan souffl amaz great way finish even wine ribera del duero hacienda monasterio smooth full bodi highli recommend top even chef came tabl nice chat artist kitchen real gentleman restaur must madrid also request tabl near kitchen watch magic attent detail precis goe prepar dish,good review,4,Spanish

Forst of all, I reserved a specific table and the restaurant gave me a different one, a table with underlight bubbles that were driving everyone crazy. The service was slow, very slow, 1 waiter could not handle all the tables in the area at once.  The wine selection could not be worst. Absolutely the worst wines I have tested in Madrid.  When the food started to arrive, I could not believe that a place would serve such terrible plates.

The guacamole was delicious!! My taco however was horrid. My husband seemed to like his but it wasn't fresh. They had been warmed in the microwave which isn't up to my standards but you do get what you pay for.  The lady serving didn't know much English but she was very sweet and tried her best to communicate with us. ,2018-01-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13112972-Reviews-or90-El_Rey_de_los_Tacos-Madrid.html,UID_6046,0.058,0.801,0.141,0.9236,0.2520833333333333,0.5454166666666667,0.4251333333333333,607,65,0.1070840197693575,2,14,False,21,0.1111111111111111,0.1481481481481481,0.1851851851851851,0.037037037037037,0.1481481481481481,0.074074074074074,0.037037037037037,0.074074074074074,0.1481481481481481,0.037037037037037,119,85,4.084033613445378,0,0,there bar front tabl chair back spot tini empti price cheap grab whole load taco cheap price got huitlacoch taco husband got meat chicken taco also got guacamol share guacamol delici taco howev horrid husband seem like fresh warm microwav standard get pay ladi serv know much english sweet tri best commun us,bad review,2,Mexican

It was my lucky day: I had the chance to eat a marvellous Spaghetti ai frutti di mare ( pasta seafood). As an Italian, I am rather skeptical when it comes to eating Italian abroad but I have to admit that the experience in La Piccola Trattoria made up my mind: each ingredient - starting from the pasta (handmade) to the musses (very fresh) - was delicious and even the presentation of the plate was impeccable. Not to mention the culan with pistacchio (woooow). I have the luck to live next to this cozy restaurant and Mr Giuseppe will see me every other day, but for those of you who want to see an experienced and passionate Italian chef in action I’d suggest to reserve one of the few table available.

The owner took the time to translate everything for us as well as telling us what he thought we would like and he was right. The lady at front of house was very sweet even though we didn't have much language in common!  The main things about the food was the excellent flavour and freshness- nothing seemed pre-prepared. Can't think of a meal in Italy that was better and can think of many worse! We came twice in one week.

Maybe we came in on a day they were short staffed, because there was only one girl working (who seemed really sweet but we speak primarily English and she spoke primarily Spanish so there was definitely a big language barrier and we couldn’t understand much). We ordered the tuna dip for an appetizer (which was good but definitely just tuna out of a cab with mayo and some other stuff along with tortilla chips from a bag thrown on a plate). We then got 4 different tacos. My boyfriend said it appeared that the girl was pulling meat out of prepackaged bags, like they were just store bought pre made meats. The tacos came and they were pretty underwhelming. We got the chicken mole one, I really didn’t like that one, it also was basically just a pile of mushy sauce, barely any chicken and had a weird flavor in my opinion. The two pork ones, pastor and another one I forget, weren’t bad but the slow cooked pork looked pretty unappetizing to me. Overall I was sadly pretty disappointed with this place and don’t really understand how it got such good ratings. Thinking maybe we ordered the wrong stuff? But it was all pretty disappointing so I’m not sure.

Got to El Rey around 8:45 PM looking forward to try some Mexican food after being in Madrid for a few days.....that spicy spirit calls unto you in mysterious and profound ways. Waitress was friendly and promptly took our drink and food order. Our horchatas (rice drink) were definitely not homemade and very much powder based. The only good thing about the horchatas were that they came out within the first five minutes of ordering.  The place is very small and with only a handful of patrons...5 to be exact.....we waited and waited and waited and waited. Finally after 45 minutes, we received our appetizer of queso fundido with rajas. There was plenty to be desired here as it was melted cheddar that quickly hardened, topped with slices of poblano and onions, along with kernels of corn. 10 minutes later, we finally get ONLY a portion of our order. In case you’re not keeping track, this is 55 minutes after we placed our order!!! We, party of 2, ordered 3 tacos each....2 cochinito pibil, 2 tinga de pollo and 2 carnitas. We only got 4, sans carnitas. Waitress acknowledged it wasn’t full order and would be bringing the rest out soon. What about the taste you ask? Well, the cochinita pibil was really flavorful though the corn tortillas it was on didn’t do it justice. Can’t say the same of the chicken. You will see that they use THE MICROWAVE quite a bit here. Tortillas were dry and brittle, which made the taco fall apart instantly, and not in the way where juices are running down your fingers, consuming you in Mexican ecstasy my friends. More like when your chubby cousin really wants to look good in a skinny Aeropostale T-shirt but nothing is held in. Love you primo!! We finally get our last two tacos, but what is this??? More tinga de pollo tacos?!?! And not my favorite of the two I must say! Waitress took the tacos back and while she and the “cook” tried to sort it out, we decided to cancel the last of the order as it was after 10 pm at this point. No apologies, and in fact the “cook” seemed offended we cancelled as she said she was about to heat up the tacos....meaning tortillas in the microwave.  1 star for the waitress who really was friendly and another for the cochinita pibil.

However, this was more of a bar first and taqueria second. It wasn’t the best Mexican food, but it was good - and they have a fun way of presenting the tacos.  The tacos are small (like CD sized) and you order them individually. I ordered four. The best was the pork with marinated onions. The worst was the chicken - it was dry and hard like it was cooked and left out all day.  I would try a few more Mexican restaurants before coming back here.

The place was busy, but we found a table, and a waiter brought us an English menu almost immediately. We ordered two glasses of sangria and two empanadas, one cheese and onion (queso y cebollo), and one Arabian style (estilo de Arabe). The sangria was wonderful, with the requisite slices of fresh lemon and fresh orange. While both empanadas were good, the clear winner was the Arabian style. It had finely ground meat (lamb?) subtly favored with many spices. Delicious! Service was prompt and attentive; we ordered five minutes after we arrived, and 2 minutes after that we had our sangrias, and 5 minutes after that we had hot and freshly made empanadas at the table. Our bill was €12.40, a good price for a great light lunch. This place is very well located if you are staying at the Urban Sea Atocha 113 hotel (reviewed elsewhere here on TA); it was a five-minute walk.  We stopped in again the next day for a second meal, this time around 6pm. We had the ham and cheese (jamon y queso) empanada and the chicken (pollo) empanada, two sangrias, and a sparkling water. While both empanadas, split between us, were very good, we thought the pollo was the better of the two. Our bill this time was €15, which seemed fair to us for a good dinner. So, our overall empanada ratings: The Arabian was best, followed by the chicken, followed by the cheese and onion, followed by the jamon y queso. That said, all four were excellent.

The staff are very helpful and it was suggested that I might go for their tasting platter.

I reached there around 1pm and seems like there're another 2tables who reach there almost the same time with me. Although waiters are busy, i do get to order after 3mins, which is quite fast in Spain! Meat Empanada is crazy delicious and price is really affordable. However, they seems to be more busy around 1:30pm. Asked for bill but no one respond to me, so they just keep 'quickly' clearing my table, twice (They are too fast that I can't even stop them to ask for a check again LOL). Which makes me feel like they were actually chasing my out when they ask me 'do you want a check?' after clearing my last plate. So my conclusion is staff wasn't friendly at all and makes me feel unwelcome.

We got the restaurant around 12.30pm and it was empty, a bit hot inside but the waiter sat us by the open window, which was great a small little table. We ordered a coke and a water. He brought these as well as some olives. We ordered a ham/rocket pizza & goats cheese salad, both were made on the premises and both were really good. Didn't leave anything, but was a struggle as pizza was very large - I would say not a typical Tapas as didn't really have tapas menu, but had small tarts, pastries, pizza, salads open sandwiches, all look delicious. If you want some thing quaint and rustic, visit here, we timed it really well as half an hour later and the place was heaving (1pm-1.30pm)- but I believe they have another tapas bar just up the street (as only accommodates around 20 people).

The place is very fancy and well designed in its own, so for a surprise party it was the best setting I could have chosen. The guests had plenty of space to sit and dance, no one pushing and getting in our way, which was great and hard to find other places that are busy on a Saturday night!  The best part of the night was Adrian (The sweetest, most cheerful and energized clown) that worked at the bar, he was just incredible! He helped us set up all the decorations and was beyond helpful throughout the whole night, never did he forget about us, which was so sweet and showed so much care for his clients!  Lastly, everyone had a great time and my sister loved everything about the night, so surprise birthday party well done with a lot of much needed help from the bar.

The restaurant prepared a room without charging us extra.  Service was great but could be better if the servers could realise that I am left-handed and rearrange the table setting for me.  For foods, we went for a la carte because most of us are small eaters. Since the restaurant emphasised on its local natural ingredients, I feel like for both my entree (egg from Mos, roe of Choco) and main dish (tuna) were a bit over salted. The sauce and dressing don’t compliment the food. Its probably just me who didn’t enjoy the food. The rest seemed to enjoy their foods. I tried my mum’s waffle or foie. It was exceptional.

I would not call this place a restaurant, it’s more like a bar. The wine and the drinks was great but not nothing that’s sticks out from other cocktail bars. We tried three small dishes, two was ok but one I couldn’t even eat. The small dishes was very expensive of what you get. Drinks and wine was otherwise good price on, 3,5 euro for a glas of wine and drinks 10 euro. If we just went for drinks l would give this place 3,5 in rate but for eating 2.

We tried the breakfast empanadas which were OK and cachapas con queso de mano, also ok. I was surprised with the cachapa price. It costs 9,50 eur but it is not worth it once you get it, in my opinion it is extremely overpriced. For that price I was expecting something bigger and tastier. Juices are very good, don't know if they are natural though. The place is very clean, service is very good. Waiters super kind.
