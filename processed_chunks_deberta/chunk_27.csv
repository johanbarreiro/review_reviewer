We went to La Paloma primarily to try their organ meats and other unusual dishes. This is a normal upscale restaurant in the upscale district of Salamanca. It by no means specializes in organ meats, but the chef does usually have a few such items on the menu. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped us choose from three or four different offerings. We started with something a little different but still unusual: erizos (sea urchin) grated and served in sea urchin shells along with a quail egg. They were delicious and tasting of the sea. One of our main courses was the manitos de cerdo (pig’s feet), which must have been somewhat labor-intensive to prepare. All the bones were removed from the feet (I did find a very small one) and then the remaining “meat” was shaped into a patty and sautéed and served with a mustard and truffle sauce. This was an elegant presentation and far from the typical image of “pig’s feet”. Our other second course was the mollejas de ternera (veal sweetbreads), braised with vegetables, pretty much the way they would be prepared in France. Our wine was a bottle of the house Rioja. Like many restaurants in Madrid, La Paloma offers half portions, a necessary corrective to the Spanish custom of serving huge amounts of food. If you are not a fan of organ meats, you should read other reviews and find out what else La Paloma offers. This is an excellent high-end restaurant with a broad selection of meats, seafood, and vegetables.",2012-07-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2317039-Reviews-or40-La_Paloma-Madrid.html,UID_23758,0.019,0.891,0.09,0.9763,0.1205729166666666,0.5174218749999999,0.3729785714285714,1581,132,0.0834914611005692,0,40,False,47,0.1224489795918367,0.1632653061224489,0.2448979591836734,0.0,0.1020408163265306,0.0408163265306122,0.0408163265306122,0.0612244897959183,0.1836734693877551,0.0408163265306122,278,185,4.690647482014389,0,0,case confus review restaur la paloma call jorg juan madrid went la paloma primarili tri organ meat unusu dish normal upscal restaur upscal district salamanca mean special organ meat chef usual item menu waiter knowledg help us choos three four differ offer start someth littl differ still unusu erizo sea urchin grate serv sea urchin shell along quail egg delici tast sea one main cours manito de cerdo pig feet must somewhat labor intens prepar bone remov feet find small one remain meat shape patti saut ed serv mustard truffl sauc eleg present far typic imag pig feet second cours molleja de ternera veal sweetbread brais veget pretti much way would prepar franc wine bottl hous rioja like mani restaur madrid la paloma offer half portion necessari correct spanish custom serv huge amount food fan organ meat read review find els la paloma offer excel high end restaur broad select meat seafood veget,good review,4

If we had discovered it sooner we would have gone more often and will certainly go again. Located in the Goya area of Salamanca in Madrid, this is an elegant and stylish restaurant - somewhat formal with a very professional level of service. We found the menu interesting and varied - on our visits supplemented by a few ""specials"". The wine list offered a wide range of Spanish wines - suiting most tastes and pockets. As another reviewer has mentioned ""half servings"" are offered for those with a smaller appetite. Also as noted by another reviewer, on our visits most other customers were fairly formally dressed or at least in smart casual attire. This is not an inexpensive restaurant: our dinners of three courses (no ""half servings""), wine, coffee and armagnac were around 75€. However, given the quality of the produce used, the high standard of cooking, the level of service and the ambience, we believed it was worth every euro spent.

She recommended a new tapas dish to their menu, which was amazing, and even brought out chocolates when we said we were too full for a whole dessert.

The upstairs was completely full with people having a drink, so we went dowstairs where they have a few sit-down tables. The downstairs is pretty much their basement, and looks the part, so we were a bit worried, but we shouldn't have been. The tapas were tasty and the waiter extremely friendly; we had the fish balls in a green curry sauce (recommended by the waiter), the peppers with cheese, and the shrimp on toast. All were good.

We were skeptical when we walked by because it doesn't look like much more than a bar from the outside since the tables are all downstairs. But, we went in based on the reviews and we were very pleased. The server was really great. I felt bad that she had to keep going up and down the stairs to get everything, but every time she got to our table she had a warm smile on her face. She was very friendly and helped us pick out some dishes based on what we told her we wanted. Everything we ate was delicious! The portions were larger than expected for tapas, but we weren't complaining. This place was exactly what we were looking for. I would go back in a heart beat.

We also had pizza which was rich in flavor, well baked and generally fine. Sangria was very tasty. The place itself, in my opinion, lacks an idea for the theme.

As we got talking, we learned that she and her sister, the manager, were Venezuelan, so a lively discussion ensued. The menu has many tapas options that can be ordered in small portions of five items or individually for a larger plate. We instead ordered the meal from the dinner side of the menu, that features paella. Our server showed us all the items on an I-pad that greatly helped us to make our choice. On her advice, my husband ordered the ""peeled""' seafood paella and said that it was the best paella he had ever had. I ordered the pasta tagliatelle with beef in a light broth. Sensational! From a decent list of wines, again on recommendation, we enjoyed a regional red. By the time our mains had arrived, the place was filling up and when we left, it was full. We returned the following day for tapas, the plate portions of three selections: pork skewers, stuffed mushrooms,and ham croquettes that we shared.This was followed by, of course, the ""peeled paella.""

I was there at lunchtime on a Monday and I only heard Spanish spoken. Not a tourist in sight (apart from me). The owner was friendly, speaks perfect English and helped me decide what to eat, primarily by talking about lots of dishes that weren't on the blackboard menu. I had meatballs and chicken curry, washed down with Rioja. The meatballs were perfect and the sauce was delicious (the generous bread serving helped to do this). I chose the curry as another website I saw when googling claimed it ""the best ever"". I'm not sure about this but it was very, very good. Chicken curry with green beans and mashed potato - weird combination for us English but very good nonetheless. If you want traditional, non touristy, good value tapas then please go here.

The staff were very professional and polite and they made us feel welcome and special. It's worth the splurge if you're a foodie!! We didn't have the tasting menu, but instead ordered 2 appetizers, 1 entree and 1 dessert each. Personally I think this is the way to go! We got to try 6 different things plus all of the little tasty extras they bring you! Typically with tasting menus you only get a bite of each item, so ordering off the regular menu gave us a chance to taste a number of different things properly. Unique food combinations with interesting textures and twists kept this meal intriguing. They started with a delicious fizzy mojito that was unlike anything we've ever had before! Some things were a little odd, but it all tasted yummy. Some examples include: little morsels that looked like olives and had the flavour of olives, but was the texture of sponge toffee (for lack of a better description). There were also emulsified ham and cheese croquettes and olive oil that had been whipped into a butter like texture and served in a mini toothpaste tube with freshly baked breads- totally yummy! Going from memory there is no way I could describe the food and do it justice. Just know that they are extremely creative and really think about food flavours and textures! If you're a meat and potatoes kind of person you can give this restaurant a miss, but if you are foodies like us and love to try the best and most creative food in town then La Terraza del Casino de Madrid is the place to go! One quick thing...it's very difficult to get a reservation! We called 2 months in advance and couldn't get in. However, any top notch hotel should be able to get you in with a phone call.

That practice is perfect for after 20 ""tastes"" you realize that part of the experience is the surprise to both your eyes, your tastebuds and your sense of touch. Your senses of smell and hearing don't get left out either for the fizz of the foaming machines and the aroma of what looks like pot roast, but isn't. Our meal started with a gin fizz that was frozen on the bottom and was topped with a warm foam on top so that you experienced the cold through the warm. The gin fizz moustache made you laugh and then you were on to snacks of the sweetest paper thin dried carrot rolled into a cigar shape and garnished with a tiny dollop of licorice sauce, a one bite savory ""pizza"", a walnut and truffle sponge that truly looked and felt like a sponge, and a tiny ""ice cream sandwich"" which was cold and had the smooth texture of ice cream but was savory parmesan cheese. After 8 of these little snacks eaten with fingers only, you are smiling, having fun, and feeling like a child, but a child with very sophisticated tastes.  Silverware is brought and then what I call the trompe l'oeil courses are served. The peach which is really frozen essence of tomato only 1/4 inch thick surrounds warm mozarella foam on a bed of basil and balsamic sauces and the poached egg that isn't an egg at all. The John Dory fish was served with five different preparations of lemon sauce each more delicate and flavorful than the one you just tasted. I hardly wanted to put them on the fish which was delicious by itself, but the combination was divine. I loved this meal. You get the idea. It is affliated with the genius, Ferran Adria of El Bulli, and if you can't go there, La Terraza is a great second.",2009-08-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d804175-Reviews-or180-Paco_Roncero_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_23840,0.0,0.822,0.178,0.9968,0.1958333333333333,0.636021505376344,0.4359416666666667,1791,169,0.0943606923506421,0,38,False,34,0.1176470588235294,0.1617647058823529,0.2941176470588235,0.0735294117647058,0.0588235294117647,0.0294117647058823,0.0441176470588235,0.0441176470588235,0.1470588235294117,0.0294117647058823,335,203,4.3462686567164175,0,0,given menu meal menu degustacion serv practic perfect tast realiz part experi surpris eye tastebud sens touch sens smell hear get left either fizz foam machin aroma look like pot roast meal start gin fizz frozen bottom top warm foam top experienc cold warm gin fizz moustach made laugh snack sweetest paper thin dri carrot roll cigar shape garnish tini dollop licoric sauc one bite savori pizza walnut truffl spong truli look felt like spong tini ice cream sandwich cold smooth textur ice cream savori parmesan chees littl snack eaten finger smile fun feel like child child sophist tast silverwar brought call tromp l oeil cours serv peach realli frozen essenc tomato inch thick surround warm mozarella foam bed basil balsam sauc poach egg egg john dori fish serv five differ prepar lemon sauc delic flavor one tast hardli want put fish delici combin divin love meal get idea affliat geniu ferran adria el bulli go la terraza great second,good review,4

Apart of the restaurant booking, you must know that this is a club building and either you must be a member or invited by one in order to just walk in, and they like jackets. We can complain as much as we like and jacket requirements will never be changed simply because they have enough events, dinners and celebrations organized by them self they do not value opinion of guests who come here for single visit. So we must endure for the food experience, 3.5 hrs later, having one course in the kitchen, after 21 course in total I can say bring that jacket with you. What you will experience is complete synergy in between kitchen with food prepared, and staff served food on your table.

Even though there is a set menu (either 12 or 16 courses), they will cater to any dietary restrictions. My wife is close to vegan and I am a carnivore. No worries. 2 different meals both sublime. They also have an extensive and reasonably priced wine list with multiple selections between $40-100, which for a restaurant of this caliber is both unusual and welcome.

I have visited so many from the San Pellegrino List and from Guide Michelin that I can´t count it. Before I have to say I was this week also at Ramon Freixa and Diverxo. ( I have also been in El Club allard last year which is on the range like Freixa)  I have lost faith in all lists after I visited Diverxo whicht I think is for me absolutely overrated and not worth the Money. Ramon Freixa was much better but also to arbitray. Luck for me I got a table in La Terrazza and I got back my faith. From the first to the last dish it was a pure pleasure which I had the last time at Berasategui in San Sebastian.  I took the Menü Degustation. The Starters where fantastic and for me the highlight was the White chocolate and the foie domino.  After the starters I had a perfect carbonara pizze with truffe- and olive oil masked as bonbons. Then I was invited to see the kitchen where I got a fantastic Chilli crab buns - thanks to the nice guys in the kitchen. Later I have had wonderful Scampi Ravioli, with tuna foie- great. Also the lobster was perfect served with Pancetta. The last main course the rabbit was my Highlight. I loved the taste of cocoa. Sweet provocation with strawberry and cream followed by chocolate and when you are full the waiter came with a cart full of sweeties. At the end you´re satisfied and lucky. For me a memorable dining night and under my Top 10 in the world.  Only one thing I have to criticize not for me but it´s possible that it disturb guests. I got a vew very good and delicious wines. The presentation is very simple you get the wine that´s it. No explanation in Detail about the Grape usw. For me it´s very OK I don´t like to hear about this things I only wan´t to drink the wine and it´s good or not.  Eventually next time speak with the guest if they want´t a explanation or not.

It soon became clear that this is because you are first taken to Chef Roncero’s “workshop” for some “snacks”, as they were called. They were fantastic....what looked like black and green olives (they weren’t) were filled with the most amazing olive oil, more olive oil frozen in nitrogen before an incredibly light creation involving prawns. From here onto the restaurant which is small and bright.

We had telephone calls and emails confirming our visit. We had an excellent flight of 17 courses with wine pairing. Service was excellent, even when the restaurant (kitchen and wait staff) was at capacity. The start of the experience is in the bar, then progresses to the kitchen area where another course is prepared in front of you. We were sitting near the open kitchen and it was a delight to watch the calm methodical workings of the chefs: concentration seemed more intense when the full restaurant was its busiest but there was no noise (talking, pans, etc.). The wait staff were excellent fully explaining each dish, how to eat the dish (actually very helpful!) and the wine selected to enhance at least one aspect of the dish.

In fact, we have to declare a - vague - personal connection with Dstage. We used to congratulate - and, I fear, slightly terrify - the chef patron on his frequent collecting of Michelin stars when we bumped into him in the lift in our building. If you find yourself with a spare €100, and you decide you deserve to spend it on yourself, do it here. This is, surely, as good as any restaurant in the world. If there are better, what can they be like? Our problem is how to review a restaurant without ruining it for you. You eat in three different places. An aperitif, usually seafood based, at the bar. Followed by another, prepared and explained on the spot by one of the dozen or so chefs at the pass in front of the (open) kitchen. You're lead through this - every dish, in detail - in the language of your choice, English or Spanish. The decor and atmosphere are simple and look smart. Exposed brick. Aluminium aircon ducting, Spotlights. Modern wooden furniture. Think, and this is a positive, brand new Pizza Express in a refurbished Victorian brewery furnished by Habitat. Tables are very large. Two of you will be seated at a place that could seat six at a push. The sense of space in a restaurant in this city is very refreshing. The fact is you shouldn't look at the photos or even read the reviews. You should go for the whole experience which has to include the surprise - the amazement - which some dishes provoke. But we're going to spoil two for you because you should ask for them on your tasting menu. Raviolis. It's the boss's signature dish. Three ravioli. A consomme. And three orange beans. And some tiny pieces of something like microscopic spring onion. And it's a work of genius. It's fabada. Condensed into three or so mouthfuls. It's the heaviest dish in the world turned into something light and still full of all the intense flavour it should have. You'll find yourself ekeing out that consomme. And those beans. They ain't beans. That's the sauce. Trapped in a bean! Maiz. There's a sort-of popcorn covered baked alaska, surrounded by candy floss. Sitting on the base of the plate, and we could write an article on the beauty of the serving dishes, is a sauce/jam/gunge of sweet stuff that ends with a hint of chilli. Rub your candy floss in it. Grab it in both hands and stuff lumps of the thing in your mouth. Then try to think of some adjectives with a silly grin on your face. Finally, tidy up with the hot towel that's magically appeared. Service is spookily, eye-openingly efficient. New plates and cutlery appear like magic. Wine and water are served silently and for once it's not to make you get through it quicker, it just keeps your table smart and tidy.

The kitchen is within the dining area meaning that diners can watch the kitchen at work and allows interaction between diners and chefs. The dishes were all beautiful in terms of taste and presentation, it was clear that a lot of time and thought had gone into creating every course. In terms of the quality of the food and the overall experience I found this to be incredibly good value for money and as is typical in Spain we didn't find ourselves being overcharged for extras, for example a glass of wine was €5. The waiting staff were also excellent, proving explanations if the food and drinks in English and provided an unrushed pace of service.

Upon arrival, greeted taken to cocktail table, ordered aperitifs, then 1st course arrived: Roman style squid in sort of mist. Excellent dish, probably the best of all. After completing this,mtaken to the bar counter opp the kitchen where we viewed the next course being developed: king prawn cebiche. This was the 2nd best flavored dish, or #1 by some. From Australia, king prawn seemed a bit small, ours are much larger, but we're in Spain! Then taken to the table where the next 10 courses were served:  Michigan, sweet mole, corn & tuba Tomato Garum Ladosa Red pepper rose, Crayfish, garlic & kombu Roasted fish skin & tuna toffe + other ones. In conclusion this was a superb experience. Many different items on each dish, some miniscule hard to view. No argument place is an epicurean experience & not to be missed while in Madrid.

When you do find the entrance a warm welcome awaits once you find D Stage. Your coat is taken and you’re directed to a seating area by the bar. A staff member arrives to take a drink order and explain the number of courses, 12, 14, 16 and ask after any food allergies. We opted for the middle number as we thought this would give us a good exploration of DSTAgE’s talents. I can tell you what we had on the day which may or not be available any other day. Despite my furious taking of notes of each course description given by the well briefed staff who brought each course to the table I needn’t have bothered. At the end of the meal we were given a nicely printed card with all the courses along with the wines.  While enjoying our drink in the bar we were presented with a smoking wooden tray covered in fresh briny seaweed and barnacle shells. Nestled in the middle was a pair of Roman style squid - soft pillows of squid that delighted when eaten   We were then escorted to the kitchen were our next course of King Prawn cebiche was prepared for us on a large block of rock salt then placed on a small square of banana leaf for us to eat. The head of the King Prawn provided the sauce for the dish. Then to our table.  A spare wooden table with only a napkin and water glass. The next few courses followed one after the other: A Mochi with a centre of sweet mote and tuba (fermented coconut water) accompanied by a glass of Ariyanas Dulce 2012 from Malaga. Then a Tomato with garum, with seaweed, anchovies, and black olives. Roasted avocado with peanut sauce and Vietnamese negus with a glass of Seda liquida Grand Cru Sake from Girona. An astonishing combination that shouldn’t work but went perfectly together. The next course was a Basque Roasted Red Pepper with red pepper rose topped with bread squares with Bat Gara Uno 2014 DO Txakoli di Alava. Stupidly good!! On to the Cod fish skin with nori sauce and confit of Tuna Eye. Each course brings with it another ingredient one would never guess. This one tasted heavily of the sea owing to the confit process. The wine was a Priorat from Scala Dei Pis dels Angels, 2017. Next was a presentation dish from the kitchen brought to the table and deconstructed. It was a large banana shallot roasted in a shell of coffee powder. The shell was cracked ad the soft succulent shallot reveals then sliced on to a plate with mushrooms and a coffee sauce. These ingredients blended together all the flavours of umami, especially when accompany by a refreshing glass of Ximenez Spinola Exceptional Harvest 2016 from Jerez. Wonderful.  On to the fish course. A chunky piece of brined cod topped with pieces of thin and crispy chicken skin. With this a glass of Sartenes o Canciones 2015 DO Ribera Sacra went perfectly. Now for the meat course, a 30 hour braised shoulder of lamb melted on to the plate topped with Kombu, cogollo and piparra, along with the Xentia 2015 Extramadura.  For fun there was a melon and fermented beet root presented on a cub of ice, eaten with the fingers in one bite. Dessert was a feuillette of fermented purple carrot with a layer of vanilla toffee. What’s listed on our menu as Corn was nothing of the sort. It was a cloud of candy floss sprinkled with corn with a quenelle of popcorn ice cream in the centre on a base of mango sauce. Eaten with the hands, impossible to eat with a fork, it brought back all the memories of a summer fun fair when you left with sticky fingers and face. Our meal at DSTAgE ended with warm towels so you cold wipe off the sticky delicious candy floss if you hadn’t already licked your fingers clean.  To finish off there was a petit four of a meringue shaped and coloured like a head of garlic. And it tasted of garlic as well. It was definitely a lunch to remember.",2018-12-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6884911-Reviews-or20-DSTAGE-Madrid.html,UID_23893,0.011,0.882,0.107,0.9967,0.2087012987012986,0.5307359307359307,0.3009125,3881,321,0.0827106415872197,2,62,False,83,0.1122448979591836,0.1224489795918367,0.2346938775510204,0.0816326530612244,0.1224489795918367,0.0510204081632653,0.0408163265306122,0.0510204081632653,0.1224489795918367,0.0612244897959183,716,407,4.412011173184357,0,0,restaur name outsid build neither number call de reguero find entranc warm welcom await find stage coat taken direct seat area bar staff member arriv take drink order explain number cours ask food allergi opt middl number thought would give us good explor dstage talent tell day may avail day despit furiou take note cours descript given well brief staff brought cours tabl bother end meal given nice print card cours along wine enjoy drink bar present smoke wooden tray cover fresh brini seawe barnacl shell nestl middl pair roman style squid soft pillow squid delight eaten escort kitchen next cours king prawn cebich prepar us larg block rock salt place small squar banana leaf us eat head king prawn provid sauc dish tabl spare wooden tabl napkin water glass next cours follow one mochi centr sweet mote tuba ferment coconut water accompani glass ariyana dulc malaga tomato garum seawe anchovi black oliv roast avocado peanut sauc vietnames negu glass seda liquida grand cru sake girona astonish combin work went perfectli togeth next cours basqu roast red pepper red pepper rose top bread squar bat gara uno txakoli di alava stupidli good cod fish skin nori sauc confit tuna eye cours bring anoth ingredi one would never guess one tast heavili sea owe confit process wine priorat scala dei pi del angel next present dish kitchen brought tabl deconstruct larg banana shallot roast shell coffe powder shell crack ad soft succul shallot reveal slice plate mushroom coffe sauc ingredi blend togeth flavour umami especi accompani refresh glass ximenez spinola except harvest jerez wonder fish cours chunki piec brine cod top piec thin crispi chicken skin glass sarten cancion ribera sacra went perfectli meat cours hour brais shoulder lamb melt plate top kombu cogollo piparra along xentia extramadura fun melon ferment beet root present cub ice eaten finger one bite dessert feuillett ferment purpl carrot layer vanilla toffe list menu corn noth sort cloud candi floss sprinkl corn quenel popcorn ice cream centr base mango sauc eaten hand imposs eat fork brought back memori summer fun fair left sticki finger face meal dstage end warm towel cold wipe sticki delici candi floss alreadi lick finger clean finish petit four meringu shape colour like head garlic tast garlic well definit lunch rememb,good review,4

The decor is post modern like the inside of a converted warehouse the kitchen and the numerous chefs is in full view of the diners but for all that it is cozy and there is a really friendly atmosphere not at all 'stuck up' or formal. The first course is served at the bar before moving to the kitchen for the second course and then to your table. All the food was interesting innovative and delicious, the wines were well paired but just a warning each glass of wine for the paring was very generous probably 125ml so after 8 glasses I was feeling the effects, if you aren't a big drinker be warned (unlike most restaurants where the paring glasses are small even mean). Whilst not cheap this was good value the meal that was closest to this in style I have had was at Funky Gourmet in Athens and that was 50% more expensive. Couple of points to note toilet facilities downstairs are fantastic worth a visit even if you don't need them! and typical Spanish they don't open until 9pm we arrived at 8.45pm for a 9pm booking and had to leave and come back.

Not a single word is spoken, as to underline the limitations of language or speech when describing that great show that life is. This is pretty much how I felt when going through the DSTAGE experience. The eyes and the mouth were on a roller-coaster of feelings, one fooling the other, leaving to the brain and the heart the strenuous duty of deciphering what was going on in front of them.  A tumultuous feast of 'trampantojos' - where everything tastes different from the way it looks - expects you from the moment you sit down at the table. You will still be debating with your partners what the last thing you ate was, trying to get a hint from the name given to the concoction or the kind explanation offered by the waiter, when the next delicious surprise will have landed in front of you. Adventurous, daring, elaborate, whether you will like everything that you will taste is irrelevant. I certainly did. What matters is what happens subconsciously, when an unexpected taste transports you elsewhere for a fraction of a moment. It's the playfulness of the unknown, the child-like curiosity that tickles our being when we crack open an Easter egg. This is no ordinary restaurant, it's a an amusement park for your taste buds.

It was my second visit but I enjoyed it as much as the first. This modern storytelling creative food restaurant with a casual atmosphere is the success story of Diego Guerrero who came from the 2 michelin star restaurant Club Allard. Dstage has only been in existence for 11 months yet already has its first star. If you want to book a table you need to do so 4 months in advance. The story of Dstage has reached many parts of the world through foodie tourists who have told its tale and posted photos of the wonderful culinary creations; each one a piece of art. It even reached The New York Times and I am sure that this article has something to do with its ever increasing popularity. I think in the haute cuisine category, it is surely Madrid’s number one. I look forward to seeing it next year in the top 10 or so of The Restaurant. It certainly deserves to be there. I loved the way the evening went. First you have a ""tapa"" with a drink at the bar, then you are taken to the bar of the kitchen and a chef makes your next course there and then in front of you. Afterwards you are taken to your table. Each course after that is served by a waiter or waitress who sometimes prepares the courses for you. That way you get to see how things are made. It's amazing.  The only thing that needs improving at Dstage is the spoken English of its employees. They all speak it or more probably have learned off by heart how to describe the dishes. The problem is that is nearly impossible to understand what they are saying as their pronunciation is so bad. I am seriously thinking of offering them private lessons in English pronunciation. Maybe I will get a free meal in exchange. Well that would be a good barter wouldn’t it?",2015-06-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6884911-Reviews-or230-DSTAGE-Madrid.html,UID_23911,0.033,0.779,0.188,0.9963,0.2000185528756957,0.5279643372500517,0.3513761904761904,1851,179,0.0967044840626688,0,29,False,65,0.1166666666666666,0.1333333333333333,0.3,0.0666666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.0166666666666666,0.0166666666666666,0.0666666666666666,0.05,0.0666666666666666,349,208,4.303724928366762,0,0,difficult describ dstage apart say one best haut cuisin restaur ever second visit enjoy much first modern storytel creativ food restaur casual atmospher success stori diego guerrero came michelin star restaur club allard dstage exist month yet alreadi first star want book tabl need month advanc stori dstage reach mani part world foodi tourist told tale post photo wonder culinari creation one piec art even reach new york time sure articl someth ever increas popular think haut cuisin categori sure madrid number one look forward see next year top restaur certainli deserv love way even went first tapa drink bar taken bar kitchen chef make next cours front afterward taken tabl cours serv waiter waitress sometim prepar cours way get see thing made amaz thing need improv dstage spoken english employe speak probabl learn heart describ dish problem nearli imposs understand say pronunci bad serious think offer privat lesson english pronunci mayb get free meal exchang well would good barter,good review,4

We are both foodies from the USA and we both work at restaurants. I has hesitant because i knew it was gonna be very expensive and i wasn't sure if it was gonna be strange for the sake of being strange. We got the tasting menu for 130E each. It is about 17 courses and i counted that i tried 23 different items (as some of the snacks had more than one item). The snacks portion of the tasting was the most unusal items. They very great and alot of fun. It got more traditional as the night went on. When we got to dessert, they made ice cream table side which was fun (even for me I am a pastry chef).  We made a long night of it, we took a break after the entrees to sit outside for about 15 minutes. They have a great patio outside that for some reason they don't use for dinner. People go out there for a smoke. We don't smoke but went out there to take pictures and get some fresh air. WE arrived at 8:30 and had drinks in the bar and we left at 1am. It was a night we will not forget. I have been lucky to eat at a few 3 star Michilin (Daniel NY, Le Bernadin NY, J. Robuchon,Toyko. This 2 star was my favorite of the all.

As a starter, the finger food appetisers were very delicately interesting and paired well with different types of olive oil. Yes there's a lot of olive oil but it is really a tea spoonful only each dish, it wont make you full all of a sudden. Eg packed in rice paper, or in an infused ball - the El bulli way. After that, we had the mains which were equally creative eg scampi in seafood stock, Iberico pork which is diced and fried, etc. the vegetable garden and the boiled egg is truly sensational - which is beyond words. Won't go into detail to ruin your experience. Dessert is good and the Citrus ice cream is paired well with small bites of orange and lemon skin, custard, sesame, marshmallow and a few other flavours. The food ingredient may not be posh or expensive, but the chef has used many ways to add different flavours to make it memorable. You will be guessing and guessing what you are eating.  Service is decent but it would be better if they went into detail of the food on the table, which is standard Michelin 3 star.

Even after 13 courses you will still be interested. Each course is a small but extraordinary experience and even the most oddball thing, like the 'vegetable garden' is delightful. OK, not every course is an entirely new, wonderful, eyepopping experience, as they were at 'El Bulli' but Adria was a genius. The chefs at La Terraza are merely seriously good. The difference between this and the usual (rather boring) Michelin star experience is that every course is imaginative and novel. You won't be eating stuff you have eaten a hundred times but which is very well cooked, presented and expensive. Here, every new course is original and brilliantly done. It beats the 'Fat Duck' hands down and there is no childish nonsense about wearing headphones for certain dishes or being forced to have the 'Mad Hatter's Tea Party.'

One thing deserves mention: they prepared a fruit sorbet at the table for us using liquid nitrogen - swirling fog all over. It was quite impressive. The sommelier helped us pick an excellent Spanish Chardonnay that did not break the bank. Also, for the last tapiplato of venizon loin the sommelier insisted we have a glass of rioja.

We happen to dine on the same night as the Casino was hosting a wedding reception -so the evening was made more glamourous by the sight of many men and women dressed in their best, celebrating a joyous occasion. You are transported to the restaurant in an old fashioned elevator with a folding brass gate and velvet settee. The restaurant is beautiful, with mirrors lining many of the walls. We opted for the smaller of the 2 tasting menus and selected wines with the help of the sommelier. As with other top tier restaurants in Spain, each course was a small work of art, beautifully presented. Every course was delicious, with some unexpected combinations of flavors. Dietary restrictions were accommodated without fuss or difficulty (every high end restaurant we booked actually asked us in advance about food allergies or restrictions). The wine list was expansive and fairly priced for a high end major city restaurant. Service was friendly and attentive. If you are able to dine in warm weather, ask if you can sit outside on the terrace. Dinner which included 2 bottles of wine and several glasses of dessert wine was about $190 per person.

The soup was unbeatable! The rest didn't have it because they had the cheaper menu.

The wine pairings were also excellent, and service was excellent on all aspects. The only hiccup in the evening is the order of two dishes, the first meat dish and the last fish dish, which should be fish first and meat after, in order for the wine to work properly. This is not the case, however, so ask for a red wine when you get the first meat dish and hang on to your white wine glasses, as they will bring fish after.

With its recent 2 Michelin star rating, I don't doubt Diego and his team will achieve a 3rd star soon. This was our 3rd time back. We enjoyed it so much this time around, we have another reservation next month! For those of you who haven't been there, the menu is not a la carte (as most Michelin restaurants). When you call and are seated, they ask for your preferences and other intolerances etc.. I always say - mala comida (bad food). They now have 3 ""experiences"" which you can choose from 12 (Dtaste) - 14 (Dstage) - 17 (Denjoy) petite dishes. 14 was a healthy size for dinner and would recommend 17 for generous lunch. With 2 bottles of wine and cocktails expect to spend 350+ Euro for 2 people easy. In the past, Diego created playful dishes like ""Faux-sabi"" and ""Garlic Meringue Dessert"" however he has changed his approach to focus on straight forward dishes. There wasn't a dish we didn't like, usually there is at least one dish you're not a fan of. One of my favorites was his interpretation of ""Chicken and Waffles"". Roasted Squab served with a brioche waffle in an aromatic sauce. My partner didn't quite understand my amusement being Spanish.  It does take several month's to get a reservation.They limit it to 4 months out and best to do it online. Be patient it is well worth the wait. There is no valet parking as it is on a pedestrian only street.  Apart from the food, what really sets Dstage aside from all the other competitors is the atmosphere and customer service. While it is a well heeled crowd, you didn't feel like you were being judged by both the restaurant and guests. Everyone was there for Diego and to enjoy the experience. Even better was the wait and kitchen staff, despite being at least 10 months from our last visit and the volume they serve, they remembered us and our preferences. Both Cristina and Zulima were amazing and kept it very lively. Everyone was smiling and happy but still efficient and professional. Other restaurants can learn from this especially a certain 3* restaurant who has flying pigs on their walls.  My only negative comment - they are not open Saturdays or Sundays. Which to be honest, they deserve those two days off!

I thought earlier in the week i had experienced excellence but in comparison this is the one for us. We were afforded an excellent table where I could watch closely the machinations of the kitchen which throughout our visit, and under the constant watchful eye of Diego ran like clockwork without a flicker of panic or chaos. The restaurant is informal and unpretentious with enough of an air of class to raise it above the norm. The menu was creative and exciting and is a credit to the obvious abundant expertise and brilliant mind of the 'Master'. Our service throughout was excellent with an exceptional and varied (and somewhat off piste) wine pairing to the 14 course menu we chose and the important front of house team complements the excellence of the kitchen. Portion sizes were perfect and one of the best I've encountered in a long while and I was thankful to find that Diego does not conform to the general final meat dish generally served under lashings of a heavy duty, rich sauce which personally, kills even the best taster menu for me, and has the confidence in the quality of his ingredients to allow them to breathe and speak for themselves. Without giving too much of the surprise menu away and to avoid spoiling for others we much enjoyed the face to face preparation of the second snack taken at the kitchen counter. Every course was perfection in all aspects. However, I do like to share my least and most favourite main dishes which might be difficult in this instance but if forced to make a decision it would be least, the ravioli and most the bun. Desserts were to die (and kill for, although not literally) and obviously further creations from the exceptional mind of Diego, the execution of all 3 final flourishes were exemplary and my hat and applause goes to those who took part in order to deliver those triumphs to our table.  As a number one, DStage has taken the lead but I will, of course, keep searching to ascertain if it can be toppled in the future but for now this is where it is (for both of us).  This has to be the number one and am shocked that it only has the one star, come on Michelin get your finger out!! A true star under magnificent leadership I was proud to shake the hand of the genius. This is not just food presented on a plate but, indeed, works of art. We truly saved the best to last, excellent value for money and would I recommend it - what do you think!!

Each restaurant I’ve been to ended up being a delightful surprise, due to their welcoming and elegant setting as well as to their delectable savors, real delicacies for our taste buds.  Last week a friend asked me to join her for diner on the same night at a restaurant that she heard to be « amazing ». A couple of hours later we were there: The presentation of the first appetizer that was served to us was refined, however its taste did not go along the same line.  Unable to eat it, we were however still enthusiastic for the next 10 platters that were to come.  Unfortunately, the following ones were simply a series of never-ending horrors, each plate being worse than the other.  Each new one made our stomach turn, halfway through the meal my friend was ready to leave.  We stayed until the end, nonetheless, barely touching the plates that kept coming. Dessert finally arrived, after some long and painful hours: A Meringue shaped like garlic on a chocolate bed. We thought that we would finally be able to eat something decent after this horror show. We were mistaken: indeed the sweet chocolate meringue was filled with GARLIC CREAM in the inside… I would therefore not recommend this restaurant to anyone, the city has enough exquisite restaurants to not have to waste your time and money on this place.",2015-02-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6884911-Reviews-or230-DSTAGE-Madrid.html,UID_23957,0.075,0.762,0.163,0.977,0.134469696969697,0.523542343073593,0.67872,1405,114,0.0811387900355871,0,27,False,43,0.1290322580645161,0.1397849462365591,0.2150537634408602,0.075268817204301,0.1397849462365591,0.032258064516129,0.064516129032258,0.064516129032258,0.086021505376344,0.053763440860215,249,168,4.626506024096385,0,0,arriv madrid almost month ago love citi ever sinc restaur end delight surpris due welcom eleg set well delect savor real delicaci tast bud last week friend ask join diner night restaur heard amaz coupl hour later present first appet serv us refin howev tast go along line unabl eat howev still enthusiast next platter come unfortun follow one simpli seri never end horror plate wors new one made stomach turn halfway meal friend readi leav stay end nonetheless bare touch plate kept come dessert final arriv long pain hour meringu shape like garlic chocol bed thought would final abl eat someth decent horror show mistaken inde sweet chocol meringu fill garlic cream insid would therefor recommend restaur anyon citi enough exquisit restaur wast time money place,bad review,2

It was a warm balmy night and with only about 15 tables outside there was a lovely intimate atmosphere whilst still having plenty of space around us.  We had chosen the full tasting menu and hadn't quite known how many courses there would be, but there were at least 25 and each one was a new experience. We sat down at 9pm and finished the last course approaching midnight so it was a full night of culinary delights!  I don't want to give anything away but I will say the menu is as inventive as it is delicious and the whole meal was a wonderful and unique experience that I would recommend to anyone visiting Madrid. The service was excellent and professional, but friendly, and dishes were all explained as they came to the table including what was edible and what wasn't! (which will mean more if you go :-).  The view from the terrace was a little more limited that I had hoped as you are close to another tall building but it was still amazing to have the experience outside and it really added to the night.  If I had any criticisms at all I would say that there were a lot of soft textures in the first third of the menu and it would have been good to have more of a mix but they did come later in the menu. Also, when the menu is 135 euros a head and the waiter offers coffee at the end, I would expect to be told that this was an extra rather than discover the 6 euro per cup cost when the bill arrives.  Overall though a fantastic night of wonderful food, innovation, beauty and skill that we will remember for a long time. My favourite courses were a wonderful cappuccino desert and a stunning lobster dish - and the sweets at the end are a wonderful conclusion!

It was an experience to be remembered even close to a year later. The chef had recently traveled to Peru and parts of Asia so the menu was heavily influenced by his traveled. I really didn't now what to expect but it was literally deliciously amazing every step of the way. From the cocktails before dinner that's we had in the sitting area. The small bites we had while at a counter near the kitchen where we also watched the chefs prepare things we would enjoy later. We'd been enjoying as many Michelin rated restaurants as possible during our ten week trip to Spain and this was by far our favorite. Even better than the ones in Paris. So. Damn. Good.

It's a small place, with a little bar upstairs and seating downstairs. Looks quite basic but don't let that put you off! The tapas here is the best I have ever tasted. So much so that we visited twice whilst on a 5 night break in Madrid.  On our 1st visit the taberna was full so we went for a drink and came back later, as Beatriz (the manager/owner) said she would have a table in about 30 mins. We are so glad we returned!! Beatriz remembered us and was genuinely pleased to see us. We were so hungry, having not eaten since breakfast, that we started ordering numerous dishes from the tapas menu. Beatriz was very helpful and suggested that 4 would suffice, but we could order more later if we were still hungry - which we did, as the food was so delicious.  On leaving we said we would return on another night and we were pleasantly surprised that when we did Beatriz remembered us again. She was just as helpful, friendly and cheerful as our 1st visit. Again, the food was delicious. Chicken red curry is a must order, although we cannot fault anything as all the dishes were beautiful. House wine is lovely too! We also received complimentary bread on both evenings, in addition to a mini dessert and drink with the bill. So kind and so thoughtful. Beatriz really looked after us and made us feel so welcome, it didn't feel like it was any effort on her behalf - we can't thank her enough!  We had two fantastic evenings here and will definitely be returning when we go back to Madrid.",2013-10-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3470895-Reviews-or420-Taberna_la_Concha-Madrid.html,UID_24040,0.015,0.72,0.265,0.9985,0.3119318181818182,0.5537878787878787,0.3760055555555555,1517,132,0.087013843111404,6,40,False,76,0.0892857142857142,0.2321428571428571,0.3571428571428571,0.0714285714285714,0.1428571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714285714285714,0.0357142857142857,281,178,4.391459074733096,0,0,taberna amaz small place littl bar upstair seat downstair look quit basic let put tapa best ever tast much visit twice whilst night break madrid st visit taberna full went drink came back later beatriz manag owner said would tabl min glad return beatriz rememb us genuin pleas see us hungri eaten sinc breakfast start order numer dish tapa menu beatriz help suggest would suffic could order later still hungri food delici leav said would return anoth night pleasantli surpris beatriz rememb us help friendli cheer st visit food delici chicken red curri must order although cannot fault anyth dish beauti hous wine love also receiv complimentari bread even addit mini dessert drink bill kind thought beatriz realli look us made us feel welcom feel like effort behalf thank enough two fantast even definit return go back madrid,very good review,5

It was also in the next block where we were staying so I was really waiting to go there. So, what did we get? Very typical Spanish tapas - muy típico - in the cellar with clinical lightning. The wine, ribera, was alright, and so was the hummus, but the pimientas con queso was, to be honest, quite lousy. Special racion for vegetarians, they advertise. I’ve been in dozens of better vegetarian restaurants and what Concha offered was also very typical Spanish vegetarian food where you just put some vegetable and cheese instead of jamon. If you want to visit Concha you are free to do so, but I am asking why don't you just visit any other bar/taberna from Cava Baja or La Latina?

Each course is served on one of a kind dishware, designed for the course. I suggest the wine pairing, particularly if you are a party of two.

Luckily, La Concha saved the day (or rather, several days!). This is a quaint little restaurant with delicious tapas that you don't see on other menus (i.e., foie gras and lentil stew). They had a separate gluten free menu and they served you gluten free bread on the side. We ordered several rounds of tapas and the restaurant was so busy I was afraid they would forget that we were gluten free and accidentally serve us our tapas on top of regular bread. However, I saw the kitchen staff announce to the server/bartender every time our order was ready ""sin gluten"", so that was a relief. As other people have stated, this restaurant is small and gets busy very quickly, but the service is still fast and friendly.

When we arrived back we were taken downstairs to the restaurant area which is very stripped back and casual - and not really what we were expecting. Still we assumed the food was what was the draw and that's what we were looking forward to trying. We ordered about 7 or 8 dishes between 2 of us and the waitress was very helpful suggesting things to order - she also let us know we'd ordered plenty and she wasn't wrong! Food wise we had some cold and hot tapas dishes, it all started very well with some very delicious cold tapas dishes, the tower of mozzarella and tomato was lovely as was the cured beef and parmesan but as we moved onto the hot dishes things started to go a bit downhill. The meatballs were awful (the couple on the table next to us didn't touch theirs and we couldn't understand why...until ours arrived.). The prawn toast wasn't great either and the thai fish balls were only ok. The bill was cheap but I don't think we left particularly satisfied and I wouldn't recommend this place to other people visiting Madrid, purely because it was too hit and miss with each dish.

After canceling my reservation and not realising it, we showed up and luckily got placed on the emergency bar table for two! Which honestly worked perfectly as I found the tables for two, simply two big and impersonal.  Everything we ate was exquisite. The navajas (razor shell) to start were excellent, then you move to the kitchen to have an incredible baby shrimp dish cooked on a Himalayan pink salt tablet, and so on! The desert for me was simply out of this world! Shaped in the form of a corn on the con and wrapped in candy cane, it was amazing. Strongly recommend a visit!

I had heard that he was trying to create a new, more informal place where he could experiment further with combinations of ingredients and flavors from far away places, and the result shows the effort that has gone into investigating and preparing the menu. I will not spoil the surprise by describing the menu here - part of the experience is letting your senses try to discover what each dish is made from, and savoring the different tastes that each course delivers in each mouthful. I will say that the attention to presentation is as detailed as to the taste, and that the service was outstanding. I enjoy a bit of banter with the waiters as long as they know how far you want to go, but they were always extremely professional.  The venue itself was very appealing to me - no sign outside, an industrial, almost loft-like space with bare brick, cast iron large window frames and an intimate atmosphere created by the lighting. You will be invited to enjoy a cocktail at the bar upon arrival, before being moved to the kitchen area and then to your table. At each place you will be served a piece of art.

Almost to the point of unfriendly, blunt, rude, not what you would expect from a 2 star restaurant.  Imagine one or two courses was delivered by saying “I’ll let you guess what it is & come back later”! Came back later collected our plates & still never told us what they were! This is not why we came here, we came here to be wowed by every dish presented.  Half of the courses here I describe as “pretentious” , creativity is one thing, pretentious is another. The taste just wasn’t to our liking.  I was hoping, keeping my fingers so crossed for a good ending at least, here comes this huge candy floss! Candy floss for goodness sake! There’s some mango purée inside but candy floss you get at the carnival or food fair! You can do better than that!  Go to Cebo, it’s another whole different experience !

Just 2 large tables and 4 smaller ones and a mysterious private dining room is all there is. And it's not really a terrace. It's an air conditioned room overlooking the inside courtyard of this private club but all the better for that in the summer heat of Madrid. Beware that the dress code for gents is a suit jacket, but it would seem that you can wear what you like as long as you have the jacket on. When we went, there was a group of Spanish men with jeans and trainers on but all with the obligatory jacket! Never mind, at least they didn't insist on a tie like in some of the more stuffier establishments in the UK.  Although Ferran had some part of the restaurant in the past he's well and truly gone now earning squillions as an international ambassador for Telefonica. In my opinion, no food experience could ever match El Bulli so there's no point in trying, but the Casino certainly still had his influence.  We had the smaller tasting menu for lunch as we were sampling Club Allard later that day and didn't want to over-face ourselves.  It was absolutely brilliant. From the Blumenthal-style cocktail made with liquid nitrogen at the start to the final dessert course everything was perfect. So was the service. Just simply faultless. Other reviewers have gone into enough detail on the actual dishes and there's no point in repeating them but I would simply say that if you are a lover of this style of food and you're in Madrid, you've simply GOT to be there.  And if you don't happen to be in Madrid, make a booking and arrange a trip.

We made reservations a month in advance, and were contacted th day before to consult with about particular tastes and allergies. The restaurant serves two versions of a tasting menu, we took the short version, which left us more than satisfied. There are some interesting features on how the food is served that are better left as a surprise, so I will not elaborate. The sequence of dishes was remarkable in flavor, presentation and creativity, with the right doses of irony and trompe l'oeil. Some dishes were re-interpreted Spanish classics, others were flights of fantasy, others were composed of very unusual and interesting ingredients. A meal to remember! The restaurant has been open only for a year, so I expect the crowds to be soon be clamoring for Michelin to bestow their shining stars. Service was excellent, and really welcomed in a city that has a long way to go in terms of service. The room was simple, with Scandinavian and industrial chic tones.

The restaurant is housed in a private club (casino) that is so visually stunning that it makes it worth the visit in and of itself. Like Per Se and 11 Madison Park, the chef prepares unexpected delights that just keep coming! Unlike these ""tasting menu"" restaurants, however, you get to actually choose your courses as you would in more traditional restaurants. In short, you get the best of both worlds...the chef's flights of fancy combined with a dinner you select yourself without being subjected to the tyranny of the kitchen! Dinner for two was less than three hundred dollars, as opposed to the $700.-$800. you would pay for a comparable meal in NYC. The service was relaxed, friendly, unpretentious and perfect! I do suggest, however, that you confirm your reservation before you go. We reserved through our hotel (Hotel Ritz, Madrd) and both we and the concierge wrote down the date and time. When we arrived, we were turned away by a rather frosty Maitre D' who scolded us for not showing up the day before. We were turned away. Returning to the hotel, the concierge argued to get us back in, but the Maitre D' was put out for most of meal. There was NO ONE waiting for a table. This did not ruin the meal, but best to check your reservation to avoid any inconvenience and embarrassment. Also, tipping can be different in Spain because they often do not allow you to put your tip on your credit card. Tips are left in cash or they will awkwardly make a separate bill for your tip. Best to check tipping policies in Spain, which tend to be different than they are in the USA and other parts of Europe. The restaurant is wonderful....don't miss it!",2013-01-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d804175-Reviews-or140-Paco_Roncero_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_22956,0.062,0.772,0.166,0.9929,0.3088611111111111,0.4702222222222222,0.4162277777777777,1765,157,0.0889518413597733,5,57,False,53,0.1290322580645161,0.1290322580645161,0.2258064516129032,0.064516129032258,0.1290322580645161,0.032258064516129,0.0,0.1129032258064516,0.1129032258064516,0.064516129032258,316,204,4.5886075949367084,0,0,mani wonder meal spain best dine experi la terraza del casino de madrid restaur hous privat club casino visual stun make worth visit like per se madison park chef prepar unexpect delight keep come unlik tast menu restaur howev get actual choos cours would tradit restaur short get best world chef flight fanci combin dinner select without subject tyranni kitchen dinner two less three hundr dollar oppos would pay compar meal nyc servic relax friendli unpretenti perfect suggest howev confirm reserv go reserv hotel hotel ritz madrd concierg wrote date time arriv turn away rather frosti maitr scold us show day turn away return hotel concierg argu get us back maitr put meal one wait tabl ruin meal best check reserv avoid inconveni embarrass also tip differ spain often allow put tip credit card tip left cash awkwardli make separ bill tip best check tip polici spain tend differ usa part europ restaur wonder miss,good review,4

The second amuse bouche of shrimp ceviche was served at the kitchen counter. Both solid ways to start our meal. We were then led to our table for the formal start of the tasting menu, which was full of delights and surprises. All were strong courses individually, but together, they flowed beautifully from start to finish. The stand-out dishes were the 'Peking Duck' (duck liver parfait sandwiched between roasted dehydrated duck skin crisps, tastes like peking duck, but texturally entirely different - in a word, genius!) and the roast octopus.  The wine match was fantastic and good value. Service was excellent, and whilst the level of English varied, everyone made an effort to explain everything in as much detail as they could. You could feel the passion in everyone's work, with no pretension in sight.

I was excited, for the first few minutes, but this rapidly disintegrated into disappointment and disbelief.  The location is certainly impressive, and the staff are attentive and courteous. The reverence given to the food however was almost risible. It is certainly adventurous, with some interesting combinations of unusual flavours (which do not always work), but nouvelle cuisine of a kind I have not seen for many years, the stuff of farcical comedy sketches - tiny toothpaste tubes of insipid sauces for one to pour on tiny, tasteless rolls of pastry, a miniscule chocolate served as an avant-garde amuse bouche journeying from the kitchen to my table as the lone inhabitant of a vast white plate on an even vaster silver platter... and when my main course finally arrived it too was on the leaner side of meagre .. as well as the colder side of tepid. I asked for a good red wine, but what arrived was mediocre and freezing cold - I know that this is often how red wine is served in Spain but it is not really to my taste, and when a heartier alternative at room temperature was politely requested, another iced version arrived. Had anyone listened to what I had said? The food is expensive - this was to be expected - but at this price and this level of surgeon-like attention to presentation and delivery something a little bit more special was expected. I had been looking for a rather special place to take some rather special guests in a few weeks.

I was remembering how it went by so fast and wished it lasted longer! For the welcome drink they had Pasco-sour which was made in front of us. Apart from the gimmick-ey liquid nitrogen (which was nice) - the lime was so so so sweet and smooth!! It just melted and the Pisco liquor was perfect addition! We tried the short tasting menu. We had anchovies in Vinegar, potato with ali-oli and sphereified olives. The potato was alright but the olives was lovely the way the flavor burst in my mouth! The Olive oil frozen toast with olive oil shuffle and olive oil cheese was okay. I loved loved the spicy popcorn and anaconda cone!! I wanted more!! I don't remember the mackerel Vietnamese roll to be honest. The white sea bass Tiraditos was really good. It was served on a piece of lime you had to bite on to. It was really good. Next was the Thai peanut. It was a peanut shaped shell made out of peanut flavor and inside was Thai curry flavors and coconut. It was short and sweet and really good. I love the presentation. The shrimp Omelette was a hit on the table. I was okay with it. It was a crispy and had small shrimp on it.  For the main course, we had the frozen gazpacho canapé. Which is alright. To be honest, I don't remember the almond vichyssoise, Dublin bay prawn, tomato and red mullet with mayo tout. The creamy rice yogurt, cockles, lemon was nice. The rack of suckling pig was really really good. The texture of the meat was great.  The palette cleanser was so so so pretty. The center section of the rose was removed and balsamic flavored red pieces we placed in between. They looked part of the rose. I can't imagine to say the beauty of the this dish.  The dessert was various components of citrus. I was plated well. I tasted good. But not the most memorable dish I have had.  I ordered the sheep milk cheese cake separately. This was not a typical cheese cake but it was smooth serving of sheep milk cheese. This was smooth and really really good. I could not finish it cause I was really full by then. We ordered the San Amato 2012 and 904 Gran Riserva 2001. I loved the wine. It was smooth.

With this in mind, I'd recommend NOT looking at the numerous photos online. The visual surprises are a key part of the experience.  The staff are warm and friendly. Dishes are explained in detail (at least in Spanish, can't speak for the English translation) and the service is faultless. Glasses are refilled with almost telepathic efficiency - wine bottles don't stay on the table. Especially of note was that the staff made the effort to ask if we'd viisted before - and when - and adjusted the menu as a result. The 8 course tasting menu, with a distinct Japanese/Latin American feel to it, actually extends to 13 dishes from arriving at the bar to finishing the dessert and is a stream of constant surprises. Ingredients - indeed whole dishes - you've eaten before in your life look completely new but may yet taste brilliantly familiar. Things you've never seen or even heard of are often spectacular, eye-opening discoveries.  So Dtsage is a culinary adventure. Approach with an open mind and you will not be disappointed in anyway whatsoever. Finally, ask for a table facing the kitchen if you want to observe the artistic precision of Diego and his team in progress.",2015-07-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6884911-Reviews-or220-DSTAGE-Madrid.html,UID_5674,0.008,0.856,0.136,0.976,0.1407878787878788,0.4828484848484848,0.2912142857142857,1314,98,0.0745814307458143,0,37,False,32,0.1428571428571428,0.0476190476190476,0.3333333333333333,0.0238095238095238,0.1904761904761904,0.0476190476190476,0.0476190476190476,0.0238095238095238,0.0714285714285714,0.0714285714285714,226,162,4.8097345132743365,0,0,dstage disappoint knock first restaur genuin worri give away spoiler mind recommend look numer photo onlin visual surpris key part experi staff warm friendli dish explain detail least spanish speak english translat servic faultless glass refil almost telepath effici wine bottl stay tabl especi note staff made effort ask viist adjust menu result cours tast menu distinct japanes latin american feel actual extend dish arriv bar finish dessert stream constant surpris ingredi inde whole dish eaten life look complet new may yet tast brilliantli familiar thing never seen even heard often spectacular eye open discoveri dtsage culinari adventur approach open mind disappoint anyway whatsoev final ask tabl face kitchen want observ artist precis diego team progress,good review,4

I guess we...,"DSTAgE was the first restaurant reservation I made for our trip to Spain and it was our last meal in Madrid. It makes me sad thinking about it. I wish I could go back in time and experience it all over again. I guess we left the best for last. I love the fact that many restaurants in Spain served the same menu at lunch time as they did dinner time. I know in NYC some restaurants offer that but in LA it is all about dinner. DSTAgE means “Days to Smell Taste Amaze Grow & Enjoy”. Chef Diego Guerrero left the two Michelin star restaurant, El Club Allard in 2013 to open up this restaurant last summer. In less than one year they earned their first Michelin star. The restaurant looked industrial with exposed brick and hardwood floor. I guess he wanted the emphasis to be on the food. Upon entering the restaurant a staff member checks your name on the list and invites you to seat at the bar area. You can have a drink and they serve you the first course . You are then taken to the open kitchen area where one of the chefs prepares your next course. After that, you are seated in the dining room. They have two tasting menus: DTASTE, with 10 creations, for 88 Euros, and DSTAgE, with 13 creations, for 118 Euros. We went for the shorter one and it was plenty of food. This must have been the most interactive restaurant experience we have ever had. A couple of the dishes with many steps were prepared in front of you. The servers/cooks were friendly and spoke English but at times we smiled when our waitress introduced every dish with, “I made this and that”. As I made an eye contact with Chef Diego Guerrero, he came over and I thanked him for the wonderful experience we had. He seemed very friendly and humble. we had the following courses: Sea Urchin & Citric Dashi As soon as I saw this dish, I knew we were in for a treat. I love uni and this was not only visually stunning, but tasted great also. The only problem was you wanted more of it, much more. King Prawn Ceviche This was like having a personal chef preparing an amazing dish for you. Every time I wanted to snap a picture, he added more ingredients to the dish. He first mixed the king prawn on the top of a himalayan salt slab. He then placed it on a strip of banana leaf and added all kind of garnishes. You were instructed to hold it like a cigar and drop it in your mouth like an oyster. Huitlacoche Mochi Interesting fusion of Latin and Asian. Quinoa Bread When our waitress mentioned quinoa bread, I was like What? Of Course I wanted to try it. I have never had quinoa bread before and found it nutty and dense. Now I have to find a recipe and make my own. How creative of them to come up with that. Tuna, Toffee & “Foiesabi” This was a surf and turf dish. Tuna and foie gras plus toffee for sweetness and crunch. A nice dish. Octopus roasted with “Tomatillo” We love octopus and enjoyed this dish. Tolosa Bean Ravioli with Cabbage Broth This dish was amazing. Who knew beans could taste so heavenly. The cabbage broth almost tasted like dashi. From Winter to Spring As you can see there was a big production for this dish and was very interactive. Torching and mixing all kind of exotic ingredients from around the globe. It tasted sensational. Red Mullet braised with Saffron Sauce and Crispy Scales A nice light dish. “The Butcher’s Cut” This must have been the first beef dish we had in Spain because we all know how much Spanish love their pork. Not only the presentation was original and imaginative, the beef tasted out of this world. Maji Leaf After that heavenly beef this was a nice refreshing treat. Popcorn with Strawberries and Sweet Egg Yolk I liked the strawberries more than the popcorn and loved the presentation. Purple Garlic A meringue filled with black garlic cream was a nice ending to a wonderful lunch. Now, I have to go and wipe off my tears!!

It is part of a private club in one of the NH Hotels. Security was a bit overly enthusiastic in terms of even letting us in, although we had reservations made well in advance.  We dined inside, not on the terrace, but that made little difference because the issues that quickly surfaced have nothing to do with service, ambiance or décor. They lie in what is going on in the kitchen and in the mind of the chef. Selecting this as our third top-level dinner in a week in Madrid was a mistake. We had previous dined at Goya in The Ritz Hotel and Zalacain and were impressed by both. But, imagine going to what you think is going to be a top notch experience and leaving, as one previous reviewer put it, “feeling a little sick.” Not sick just because we’d spent over $500 US on what turned out to be little more than a disconnected array of amuse bouche dishes, but also because these little tapas tidbits were just short of being terrible in terms of taste and did not mesh in any way we could identify.  This was an assembly of odds and ends, leading up to the final dish of rabbit cevit, which, in our opinion, was nothing special.  Coherence among this many items would seem to be essential if the diner is to come away with some sort of conclusion other than that the chef is doing his own thing.  Some of the minute dishes were fine: the ‘mackerel teriyaki,’ ‘lobster with olive oil soup’ and ‘Monkfish with celeriac puree and chick pea comsomme’ were quite good, but most of the rest of the twenty some tiny servings were garishly cute and not especially tasty either, at least not to our reasonably sophisticated palates. (Over 40 years, we have enjoyed many meals prepared by Europe’s and Asia’s top chefs and never felt so put off as we did here.)  Almost everything we tasted was loaded with salt. I sent one dish, a mixture of mozzarella, anchovies and basil jelly, back as being beyond my limit for sodium. Desserts were fine, but again, nothing exceptional. Service however, was embarrassingly fine. Our waiter worked hard bringing out and explaining dish after dish and we ate and commented hopefully, but in the end, service cannot supplant great taste experiences and a coherence among the different textures and ingredients served. The wine list was large and impressive, but we elected to have the sommelier match three wines for us with the dishes. He struck out with his first offering, a sherry that, from our non-Spanish perspective, didn’t work with anything we were served. His second wine was a white neither of us could identify with and so I requested that he select a Spanish sparkling wine, a moderately priced cava. It was satisfactory, more or less, although grossly overpriced, but I think that by then they had lost us.  Finally, I think there is a difference between demonstrating creativity and just being cute. Two examples: (1) A tiny tartlet with some non-descript contents was served with a small pharmaceutical-style tube of unidentified contents. We were told to open the tube and squirt the contents onto the tart. Other than a very salty flavor, there was nothing to this. (2) A so-called ‘Kellogg’s Paella’ involved a clear plastic package of enhanced Kellogg’s Rice Krispies cereal that we were instructed to add to a small demitasse cup of mediocre seafood bisque. Halfway through this, we were told to add a single tiny, seemingly raw baby prawn, (what we call ‘popcorn shrimp’ at home), and then squeeze a clear plastic tube of some glop into the mixture. The result? Glop. Cute. Pointless, expensive nonsense.  Observation: much of what was served was finger food, yet we were never offered so much as a damp napkin to clean our fingers or hands before or throughout the meal. Another reviewer mentioned “The emperor’s new clothes,” in an analogy to what is going on here and that fits well. Madrid has so much going for it, its a shame that this sham is allowed to continue based on a Michelin stars award. Incidentally, they made a big deal about having a dress code that specifies a coat for men. We dressed formally, as we often do, but saw diners who were wearing street clothes with what would hardly pass for a dress or business jacket. Why have a code if it is not enforced? Our tab, with two tasting menu ‘dinners’ and a mid range bottle of cava was about $525US. No thanks, we will not be going back.",2012-03-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d804175-Reviews-or150-Paco_Roncero_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_22853,0.045,0.849,0.106,0.9945,0.1008144497778644,0.4975364472925448,0.3906105263157895,4396,361,0.0821201091901728,0,105,False,114,0.0982142857142857,0.0982142857142857,0.2232142857142857,0.0446428571428571,0.125,0.0535714285714285,0.0714285714285714,0.0357142857142857,0.1517857142857142,0.0982142857142857,779,448,4.634146341463414,0,0,one strang restaur part privat club one nh hotel secur bit overli enthusiast term even let us although reserv made well advanc dine insid terrac made littl differ issu quickli surfac noth servic ambianc cor lie go kitchen mind chef select third top level dinner week madrid mistak previou dine goya ritz hotel zalacain impress imagin go think go top notch experi leav one previou review put feel littl sick sick spent us turn littl disconnect array amus bouch dish also littl tapa tidbit short terribl term tast mesh way could identifi assembl odd end lead final dish rabbit cevit opinion noth special coher among mani item would seem essenti diner come away sort conclus chef thing minut dish fine mackerel teriyaki lobster oliv oil soup monkfish celeriac pure chick pea comsomm quit good rest twenti tini serv garishli cute especi tasti either least reason sophist palat year enjoy mani meal prepar europ asia top chef never felt put almost everyth tast load salt sent one dish mixtur mozzarella anchovi basil jelli back beyond limit sodium dessert fine noth except servic howev embarrassingli fine waiter work hard bring explain dish dish ate comment hope end servic cannot supplant great tast experi coher among differ textur ingredi serv wine list larg impress elect sommeli match three wine us dish struck first offer sherri non spanish perspect work anyth serv second wine white neither us could identifi request select spanish sparkl wine moder price cava satisfactori less although grossli overpr think lost us final think differ demonstr creativ cute two exampl tini tartlet non descript content serv small pharmaceut style tube unidentifi content told open tube squirt content onto tart salti flavor noth call kellogg paella involv clear plastic packag enhanc kellogg rice krispi cereal instruct add small demitass cup mediocr seafood bisqu halfway told add singl tini seemingli raw babi prawn call popcorn shrimp home squeez clear plastic tube glop mixtur result glop cute pointless expens nonsens observ much serv finger food yet never offer much damp napkin clean finger hand throughout meal anoth review mention emperor new cloth analog go fit well madrid much go shame sham allow continu base michelin star award incident made big deal dress code specifi coat men dress formal often saw diner wear street cloth would hardli pass dress busi jacket code enforc tab two tast menu dinner mid rang bottl cava us thank go back,bad review,2

We were then led to the open kitchen, where we had the second course, king prawn ceviche tossed on Himalayan salt board with Austrailan finger lime. Afterwards we were comfortably seated at our table to take the rest of the courses. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish. The salmon barbel, tolosa bean ravioli and slow cooked beef were to die for.

Gimmicky dishes in interesting containers and utensils had a deceiving look. Most of the dishes were excessively salty. It was alright to use ingredients with saltiness like seaweed but it was unacceptable when the sauce that came with it was even saltier and dehydrated the tongue. Some dishes were alright, like the rose pepper. It tasted so heavy and so concentrated. Among the hot dishes, the beef with some smoky aroma tasted the best. Though still a bit salty, the beef was juicy, tender and flavourful. We were doubtful after the first few dishes. Our suspicion was proved to be right when each dish came.  Finally, we made it to the palette-cleansing plate, which was quite refreshing. Though we joked that the desserts might be salty as well, we were so shocked when they actually were. Fermented strawberry that went with brine solution failed to impress.  To be fair, the popcorn icecream that was served inside a huge marshmallow was great. Also, sweetness of the marshmallow was well balanced by the salty and sour seasoning powder. It was the best dish of the night. It was a relief to pay and leave. So sad that we leave Madrid with such a bad last memory.",2019-05-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6884911-Reviews-or10-DSTAGE-Madrid.html,UID_21159,0.133,0.672,0.195,0.9675,0.0792487684729064,0.5707717569786536,0.4718555555555555,1342,113,0.0842026825633383,0,30,False,41,0.0416666666666666,0.0833333333333333,0.3125,0.0833333333333333,0.1041666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.0833333333333333,236,151,4.677966101694915,0,0,dinner start staff member greet us entranc turn servic poor staff never show smile friendli gimmicki dish interest contain utensil deceiv look dish excess salti alright use ingredi salti like seawe unaccept sauc came even saltier dehydr tongu dish alright like rose pepper tast heavi concentr among hot dish beef smoki aroma tast best though still bit salti beef juici tender flavour doubt first dish suspicion prove right dish came final made palett cleans plate quit refresh though joke dessert might salti well shock actual ferment strawberri went brine solut fail impress fair popcorn icecream serv insid huge marshmallow great also sweet marshmallow well balanc salti sour season powder best dish night relief pay leav sad leav madrid bad last memori,bad review,2

I enjoyed the appetizer being served in the bar waiting area. My favorite was the 2nd course at the kitchen, having the chef speak and describe to me what was being prepared. The staff were good to eplain all the dishes when they were presented. This was truly an amazing experience. Trying out new flavors and learning that how food looks and taste in your mouth, may be completely different. Your eyes deceive you! This is truly the ingenuity of the Chef to formulate a menu such as this. We came to celebrate a birthday, and was happy that my side note on the reservation was recognized, and we were given a surprise. Thank u so much.

But at the margins, at the right hand extreme of the bell curve of excellence, well, costs increase dramatically. There are very few establishments occupying that territory, and our lunch service was full, so clearly there are enough folks willing to pay big time, for a big-time culinary treat. I'll try to do this place justice. I won't cover every course, I lost track at 21. The wine parings made losing track quite easy.  Service: Starched shirt, military discipline, snap-to service. Yet friendly, welcoming and jovial. Perfect. Service can easily get over the top. It can intrude or frustrate. Achieving perfect service is really hard. This was perfect. Watch the eyes of everyone who works here. They are CONSTANTLY but casually scanning the room for any hint of something amiss, a need not met. A head nod at anyone gets instant attention. The hierarchy here works so well, you don't see it. Example, a plate needs removing, and the sommelier happens to be the closest person, then the sommelier jumps to action and buses. No problem. Awesome service. Best I have ever seen. Effortlessly bilingual for those who may not speak Spanish.  Location and ambience: Walk into this place and you know you're going to get something special, from the greeter at the Casino's front desk, to service at the elevator, this place exudes class. The dining room is lively, bright, quiet and fresh. No need to whisper, no need to shout. Decor is whimsical (first time I've ever used that word in a review). Lovely place. Food: We ordered the long menu. I ordered wine parings. Can't cheap out now. Best food I've ever had? That's tough. Was everyone of the 21 (I think) courses the best of its kind that I've had? No, a couple fell short. But then there were the many, many others that were transformative. Is it possible to get the entire taste of Italy in one bite? Yes, it is. With a bite sized pizza that utterly, utterly captured Italy. A teeny taco that again, utterly captured Mexican cuisine in one bite. In one bite. Foamed calamari that may have been the best thing I have ever tasted. Ever. Full stop. And on and on and on.  After a few courses, we were approached and asked if we wanted to take part in an ""investigation"". Why yes, of course! We were then taken down the elevator to a mysteriously lit kitchen with a long counter. We were told where to stand, in order to investigate the olive oils of Spain. Little imitation olives that instantly melted in the mouth, were the start. Then, an oven was opened and a small loaf of bread produced. Three bowls of oil were placed in front of us for dipping and experimenting with flavour. The oils were awesome, of course. But my family agreed the bread, made with oil, was the best bread we had ever eaten. How on earth did they achieve that? Then, whisked back to our tables where lunch resumed. Lunch was four hours. It seemed like one, maybe two. Desserts were beautiful. A special surprise awaits at the end of dessert. I won't reveal the plot. Wine parings went from kinda funky at the start, in my view, to out of this world near the end. Course, wine always gets better with more use doesn't it?  We consumed a vast amount of food. Vast. But we left just pleasantly full, not bloated, not uncomfortable. It takes skill to gorge people like this place does, and not let them feel gorged.  Then, it was over. And we were left alone to ponder what had just happened. The bill only came when we asked for it. It came in a lovely silver box; which I believe I should own after seeing the bill. How much? I won't be vulgar. But lunch for three was many hundreds of Euros. Many, many.  I don't know if we'll be back. Madrid is far away for us. But will we forget this meal? Never. Was it ""worth it""? Is a million-dollar work of art by a master artist ""worth it""? Who knows, it costs what it costs. It was a pretty penny for this family. But when a family can spend four hours talking, laughing, gasping, experiencing the very high heights of gastronomy - and making indelible memories, well, that's priceless.",2019-05-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d804175-Reviews-or10-Paco_Roncero_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_24158,0.043,0.746,0.211,0.9995,0.2475586766541823,0.5542074192973068,0.3341879518072289,4189,324,0.0773454285032227,1,170,False,146,0.1225806451612903,0.1419354838709677,0.2516129032258064,0.0387096774193548,0.1354838709677419,0.0258064516129032,0.0387096774193548,0.0387096774193548,0.1419354838709677,0.064516129032258,755,453,4.541721854304636,0,0,seem gourmet food like rare commod get better averag experi need pay margin right hand extrem bell curv excel well cost increas dramat establish occupi territori lunch servic full clearli enough folk will pay big time big time culinari treat tri place justic cover everi cours lost track wine pare made lose track quit easi servic starch shirt militari disciplin snap servic yet friendli welcom jovial perfect servic easili get top intrud frustrat achiev perfect servic realli hard perfect watch eye everyon work constantli casual scan room hint someth amiss need met head nod anyon get instant attent hierarchi work well see exampl plate need remov sommeli happen closest person sommeli jump action buse problem awesom servic best ever seen effortlessli bilingu may speak spanish locat ambienc walk place know go get someth special greeter casino front desk servic elev place exud class dine room live bright quiet fresh need whisper need shout decor whimsic first time ever use word review love place food order long menu order wine pare cheap best food ever tough everyon think cours best kind coupl fell short mani mani other transform possibl get entir tast itali one bite ye bite size pizza utterli utterli captur itali teeni taco utterli captur mexican cuisin one bite one bite foam calamari may best thing ever tast ever full stop cours approach ask want take part investig ye cours taken elev mysteri lit kitchen long counter told stand order investig oliv oil spain littl imit oliv instantli melt mouth start oven open small loaf bread produc three bowl oil place front us dip experi flavour oil awesom cours famili agre bread made oil best bread ever eaten earth achiev whisk back tabl lunch resum lunch four hour seem like one mayb two dessert beauti special surpris await end dessert reveal plot wine pare went kinda funki start view world near end cours wine alway get better use consum vast amount food vast left pleasantli full bloat uncomfort take skill gorg peopl like place let feel gorg left alon ponder happen bill came ask came love silver box believ see bill much vulgar lunch three mani hundr euro mani mani know back madrid far away us forget meal never worth million dollar work art master artist worth know cost cost pretti penni famili famili spend four hour talk laugh gasp experienc high height gastronomi make indel memori well priceless,good review,4

What a cute discovery! My wife had the ravioli, and my son had the pulpo (octopus), both of which were very well made. The highlight item, however, was the sangria. It was so refreshing and smooth, and it was certainly the best sangria we had over 2 weeks in Spain. I think the secret was the addition of a little vermouth. The best part of the experience was that the owner was so friendly! She patiently accepted my poor Spanish, and it was such great fun talking to her about each others lives and backgrounds. Her sister even came out from the kitchen to talk with my wife, son, and me! It was an honor to speak to them about Spain, Venezuela, and the US. Finally, my son absolutely loved her chocolate cake, and she made sure that he got an extra big piece.

Arrived at the casino and was escorted up the old traditional elevator (where you have to open your own door) to the 3rd floor. The restaurant looks totally different from the casino lobby, which was in deep reds and browns and looking old. The restaurant being on the terrace, is bright and airy and dressed in white. Like a greenhouse They have 2 lunch sets and also a la carte option. I went with the shorter set, which already has about 8 courses I won't go into detail of each, but they were creative and outstanding . Liquid nitrogen, food hanging on a clothes peg, lots of molecular gastronomy techniques . They all aim to wow and succeeded. Perhaps the only disappointment was that my beef was undercooked  Even the tea selection was mind boggling . A large chest was rolled over and 2 drawers of about 100 blends appeared .

The building is indeed marvellous - the hall from which you take a lift to the restaurant is a marvel of Rococco splendour with the most fabulous staircase. Sadly this is where the aesthetics came to a halt. We were guided to our seats in what felt like a corridor. The black and white floor, hideous grey pillars and mirrors felt like some set from a 70's film. Silence reigned with more waiters than there were clients. At this point we thought about making a run for it but the whole mechanism had already swung in to action. The menu degustation was akin to a bush tucker trial - some good parts, some simply awful and mostly completely ridiculous. We didn't know whether to laugh or cry. By the end of the evening even the waiters had begun to find the whole thing funny. As the menu ticked on we became more and more desperate for the experience to be over and actually began to feel really quite ill.

We often go to Michelin star restaurants so I will use those as my point of reference. I have to say, knowing that the chef behind El Bulli was a consultant here made us walk in with high expectations...and except for some glitches with the wine this was a perfect meal. One quick logistical point - as in many 2 or 3 star restaurants you are expected to wear a jacket. if you dont bring one they will provide you with one (but always better to bring your own). So lets get into it: The place The restaurant is located on the roof of the casino (although I didn't see any casino). The building is a majestic building that must have a couple centuries in what I would call a French style. After a brief elevator ride you arrive at the last floor in a beautiful decor (they have an indoor option but we ate outside in the terrace). There was some live music (although I have to say a long tail piano would have been more appropriate than an electric organ but it was all good...) The food One comes to this sort of restaurant for the food and I have to say that for the food itself I would not have been surprised if this place had three stars. The 135 euro menu with some 20 courses was amazing. The dishes were innovative, inventive and surprising. It was a journey of culinary discovery...truly amazing. Don't come here if you are looking for large dishes with a home made feel...this is a place where food is an art...and at 135 euros for a 20 course menu it was a bargain. (You can also order ""a la carte"" but it may cost you just as much for less dishes). I've been to places that charge 2-3 times that and are not as interesting. I particularly enjoyed the ""pasta bolognesa"" (which actually is made of calamari) or the sole meunière which was amazing. The other 18 courses were also great and in the end you don't feel too full despite the number of dishes... The wine This was, in my humble opinion, what made this a 2 and not a 3 star restaurant. Given that my pregnant wife could not drink I asked the sommelier to match the dinner with wines by the glass...she quickly agreed but instead of making me experiment different wines as the courses came, she just left me a bottle of a very uninteresting Sauvignon blanc from Rueda (until I asked them to change - this was followed by an average Rioja). Yes, at 14 euros for the many glasses I had this was an amazing bargain...but I would expect a little more effort from this sort of restaurant. I overheard her explain to another table that the current menu was adapted to ""white wines""...but a real effort would have been to make me discover 3-4 white wines...this was a disappointment. The wine menu seemed to be reasonable (a large book that I didn't go through) but this sort of restaurant should have the option to offer wines to match the multiple dishes offered (which is hard to do yourself unless you are in a group of 4+) The service This is what I would describe as the perfect service (aside from the wine episode). The service was attentive, non-intrusive and always present. I have food allergies and my wife has a ton of limitations as she is pregnant and they made multiple changes in the many courses without even the slightest pushback. Aside from that the service was quick but not pushy. Just as a notice, this is great European service...so don't expect the waiter to tell you his name or his favorite vacation spot...that would not be considered good service in this part of the world...don't take that as a signal of lack of interest or being pretentious...it's just the way things are (I am saying this because I read some of the comments that spoke of this) Overall I've been to most of the 2 star restaurants in Madrid and several one stars and feel comfortable saying that this is the best restaurant in town (I might change my mind but so far...). This is also one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while...probably just a notch below the Fat Duck (which we recently visited) or the Mugaritz (based on the experience as I would say the food itself is at least as good). Highly recommended!!! Don't miss this restaurant if you are really into innovative cuisine or are just open to taste things that are above the ordinary...",2013-06-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d804175-Reviews-or130-Paco_Roncero_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_24193,0.021,0.852,0.127,0.9986,0.2588345590152819,0.4773551348250142,0.3896678571428572,4276,402,0.0940130963517306,3,140,False,164,0.14375,0.16875,0.31875,0.075,0.19375,0.0,0.0125,0.01875,0.0375,0.03125,789,373,4.420785804816223,0,0,went restaur wife anniversari often go michelin star restaur use point refer say know chef behind el bulli consult made us walk high expect except glitch wine perfect meal one quick logist point mani star restaur expect wear jacket dont bring one provid one alway better bring let get place restaur locat roof casino although see casino build majest build must coupl centuri would call french style brief elev ride arriv last floor beauti decor indoor option ate outsid terrac live music although say long tail piano would appropri electr organ good food one come sort restaur food say food would surpris place three star euro menu cours amaz dish innov invent surpris journey culinari discoveri truli amaz come look larg dish home made feel place food art euro cours menu bargain also order la cart may cost much less dish place charg time interest particularli enjoy pasta bolognesa actual made calamari sole meuni amaz cours also great end feel full despit number dish wine humbl opinion made star restaur given pregnant wife could drink ask sommeli match dinner wine glass quickli agre instead make experi differ wine cours came left bottl uninterest sauvignon blanc rueda ask chang follow averag rioja ye euro mani glass amaz bargain would expect littl effort sort restaur overheard explain anoth tabl current menu adapt white wine real effort would make discov white wine disappoint wine menu seem reason larg book go sort restaur option offer wine match multipl dish offer hard unless group servic would describ perfect servic asid wine episod servic attent non intrus alway present food allergi wife ton limit pregnant made multipl chang mani cours without even slightest pushback asid servic quick pushi notic great european servic expect waiter tell name favorit vacat spot would consid good servic part world take signal lack interest pretenti way thing say read comment spoke overal star restaur madrid sever one star feel comfort say best restaur town might chang mind far also one best restaur probabl notch fat duck recent visit mugaritz base experi would say food least good highli recommend miss restaur realli innov cuisin open tast thing ordinari,good review,4

While we are not fans of Michelin type restaurants, we gave it a roll.  First and foremost, La Terraza is a private club and for some reason they open the restaurant to guests. The restaurant doesn't open until 9PM but in the off chance they were to open earlier, we arrived around 8:30PM and went to the bar. The bar is large and overly bright. We were the only ones inside on a Saturday night. Nothing was cozy or comfortable and we had to wait until 9PM for dinner.  Men must wear sport coats so I had to use one of the ""in-house""coats to enter the restaurant. You are shuttled into the elevator where you are greeted by the house staff and then directed to your table. They know you are a guest but overall service is impeccable. The issue we had was the food itself. There is a tasting menu for $115Euro and ala carte. We selected ala carte. Being a Michelin two star restaurant, we were treated to many starters, each very small. Their pizza is actually a thin wafer covered in even thinner tuna. Fois gras was in a round biscuit.

You come for the molecular gastronomy that is so fashionable right now. I was here on a business dinner and would not return here for a personal visit. However it was a different experience. The restaurant is visually lovely but the atmosphere is funereal. The other diners from what we could hear of their conversations - it was very quiet - were also Americans. We saw only one Spanish speaking couple that evening. The waiters are courteous but take it all a bit too seriously for me. They missed our first course of the tasting menu and when I pointed it out, they didnt rectify that which was disappointing given how much our dinner cost. Overall it was a bit too stuffy and pretentious for my liking and I am used to eating at fine dining establishments.

At first I (coming from the world of theatre myself) was scandalized going to a restaurant calling itself dstage. What would that eating hole with surely trendy but quite chubby decore have in common with the real stage??? But it turned out that it was truly the stage where the chabiness of the place was just a staging where the the atmosphere is set for you to abandon the preconceived and the snobiness of an expensive dining experience. Where every bite would make you feel alive, bring back memories and surprise you with discoveries, sometimes of unknown, or sometimes of combinations of the known tastes, like the final garlic chocolate desert. Who would of thought that garlic, the most despised of all the spices could be a queen and a final point d'orgue in a fabulous and estátic 16 course dining experience with paired white, red, sweet wines, sake, cider and even homemade gingerbeer??? In the end I feel grateful for my life, the company of people that are next to me(such as Edu, who made it possible) , the talent of Chef Diego Guerrero, someone who was crowned by Michelin stars, yet still humble and charming talking to his customers.

We had the Degustation Menu consisting of 22 separate courses/items! Everything was sublime. Every mouthful was a delight. Best meal of my life so far! The environment is stunning. You arrive to a palace with chandeliers and gold leaf and we ate on the roof terrace under the stars. We had great fun watching the other diners and the food arriving at the other tables as part of a sequence and a dance, added to the experience.  Hard to pick just a few courses to comment on but the Iberian Pork with yucca and dates and the Tomato Rock along with the Vegetable Garden were standouts.  The biggest challenge for us early birders was arriving for dinner at 10pm and leaving just after 2am. Do not come if you cannot cope with the late and long dinner!

To our shocked surprise, alas, the visit started off on the wrong foot. When we arrived, we were told our reservation did not exist. We had made it through American Express and it was confirmed by our hotel. We were not at all happy as this was one of a series of special dinners we had planned months in advance. Then we were told it was made for the day before our visit. Still extremely unhappy, we refused to budge so easily. After some back and forth and ruffling of feathers, they agreed to sit us at a small “overflow” table set up against a wall. Obviously, it was not ideal, but sometimes life ends up being one big compromise. Needless to say, after what we had gone through, I was prepared to be highly critical of the unfolding dining experience. Once the dust had settled, the staff was very gracious and we settled for the mid-sized dining option. The restaurant’s environs have a chic, industrial feel that is buttressed by a well-curated playlist of memorable American tunes. After finally settling in, to our pleasant surprise, the food turned out to be quite fabulous. After an appetizer of razor clams and champagne, we were taken back to the open kitchen and looked on as a young chef prepared us a complex appetizer of exceptional flavors. Overall, the food comprised a variety of exquisite flavor and texture combinations for which only pictures do ample justice (see photos). The courses were beautiful, unusual, and delicious and I could not find fault with any of them. The wine list offers many reasonably priced choices with a Spanish bent (the Sketch Albarino we had was sensationally pure). At the close of the meal, Mr. D, the chef-proprietor came to our table to thank us. Though, the dance started off with us stepping on each other’s toes, it fortunately transformed into a blissful waltz. I highly recommend the DSTAGE dining experience and I highly recommend double and triple confirming your reservation prior to arrival.",2016-10-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6884911-Reviews-or110-DSTAGE-Madrid.html,UID_23942,0.039,0.781,0.179,0.9959,0.1318271221532091,0.5847360248447204,0.4095578947368421,2066,167,0.0808325266214908,0,50,False,59,0.1052631578947368,0.1789473684210526,0.3052631578947368,0.0736842105263157,0.1578947368421052,0.0105263157894736,0.0210526315789473,0.0421052631578947,0.0736842105263157,0.031578947368421,354,224,4.838983050847458,0,0,locat fun neighborhood certainli merit explor dstage outwardli unassum restaur shock surpris ala visit start wrong foot arriv told reserv exist made american express confirm hotel happi one seri special dinner plan month advanc told made day visit still extrem unhappi refus budg easili back forth ruffl feather agre sit us small overflow tabl set wall obvious ideal sometim life end one big compromis needless say gone prepar highli critic unfold dine experi dust settl staff graciou settl mid size dine option restaur environ chic industri feel buttress well curat playlist memor american tune final settl pleasant surpris food turn quit fabul appet razor clam champagn taken back open kitchen look young chef prepar us complex appet except flavor overal food compris varieti exquisit flavor textur combin pictur ampl justic see photo cours beauti unusu delici could find fault wine list offer mani reason price choic spanish bent sketch albarino sensat pure close meal mr chef proprietor came tabl thank us though danc start us step toe fortun transform bliss waltz highli recommend dstage dine experi highli recommend doubl tripl confirm reserv prior arriv,very good review,5

A red mullet was great as a tapiplato as was a cabonara egg nest and a castanuelas plate. Wine list is 50 pages!

I have always wanted to try Ferran Adria's food, so this was the closest thing for me in Madrid. The cocktail was crazy - they bring out a cart and make it in front of you, using dry ice - coffee, cherries...etc (I can't remember the exact ingredients) but it was so flavorful. Paco Roncero does amazing work. Each plate could easily be hung in a museum. It was an expensive lunch, but once you have it you can understand why.

The whole experience from beginning to end was out of this world - a truly wonderful evening which will stay with me for a very long time. We enjoyed the Taster Menu with 8 starters and 8 main courses followed by a selection of desserts whilst serenaded by a flautist and pianist. Our personal waiter explained the ingredients in each course - some of which were absolutely mind blowing; the occasion was very special and this was not lost on the staff who presented my sister and I with a cake and candles and complimentary champagne at the end of the evening. I loved the whole night and would recommend La Terraza to anyone who wants to treat themselves to a true culinary experience - many thanks to all of the staff who contributed to the evening's success.,2014-08-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d804175-Reviews-or110-Paco_Roncero_Restaurante-Madrid.html,UID_996,0.0,0.79,0.21,0.9886,0.2828306878306878,0.4678439153439153,0.366,875,81,0.0925714285714285,0,10,False,25,0.1351351351351351,0.1621621621621621,0.2702702702702703,0.081081081081081,0.1621621621621621,0.027027027027027,0.027027027027027,0.027027027027027,0.054054054054054,0.054054054054054,158,103,4.544303797468355,0,0,went restaur part th birthday celebr twin sister famili member whole experi begin end world truli wonder even stay long time enjoy taster menu starter main cours follow select dessert whilst serenad flautist pianist person waiter explain ingredi cours absolut mind blow occas special lost staff present sister cake candl complimentari champagn end even love whole night would recommend la terraza anyon want treat true culinari experi mani thank staff contribut even success,very good review,5

It was our first night in Madrid and we didn't quite understand the knack of ordering tapas and ended up ordering far too much - all delicious, so it wasn't that much of a problem! Another customer helped us and the bar tender with our wine selection and it was a gorgeous rioja - beautifully rounded and with a lovely flavour. Result! With our subsequent experience with tapas, I would say the tapas here has been taken to a new level - it was not the 'traditional' fare offered elsewhere. For instance we had black pudding dumpling and pork cheeks; not things we saw in other tapas bars.

The boys had beer and the girls had red wine. We ordered: tomatoes and mozzarella stack, meatballs, cheese platter and some cold tomatoes puréed . Everything was delicious.

The place is a tourist trap, with some dishes good and others bad, but for sure is not an “authentic spanish tapas”place. But the most horrible thing was the service downstairs. We were still eating when the waitress asked us to leave. And when we asked why she’s asking customers to leave while they’re still eating, the only reason is because they have reservation on that table for the next hour. We challenged this system and asked that we at least want to order dessert and this waitress suddenly grabbed our unfinished plates angrily and said in a high voice, “fine then tell me what you want!” She herself had caused the disturbance in that small room downstairs.

You don't say this enterieur is beautiful. It has trendy, young design, but don't take your wife for an anniversary dinner :) White wine they offered was the best we had in Madrid, very nice, fresh. Checking the menu, we saw they don't have the typical tapas, what you can see at most places. And that was we're looking for! I'm sorry, others chose foie gras etc, why? We thought it is better to go for local. We really liked the pimiento with local cheese stuffing, that was brilliant. We went there a few days later again, to have that meal! The lentil with duck was also great, as well the fish balls with green curry. Next time - because we went back - we had prawn toast, which was OK, but not so brilliant as the other tapas.",2014-05-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3470895-Reviews-or370-Taberna_la_Concha-Madrid.html,UID_24320,0.031,0.754,0.215,0.9922,0.2663799283154122,0.4875448028673835,0.5706454545454546,937,87,0.0928495197438633,2,41,False,40,0.2083333333333333,0.25,0.3333333333333333,0.0416666666666666,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0416666666666666,0.0,177,134,4.299435028248587,0,0,small nice place enter street chair go basement similar bit tabl altogeth around peopl sit say enterieur beauti trendi young design take wife anniversari dinner white wine offer best madrid nice fresh check menu saw typic tapa see place look sorri other chose foie gra etc thought better go local realli like pimiento local chees stuf brilliant went day later meal lentil duck also great well fish ball green curri next time went back prawn toast ok brilliant tapa,good review,4

They have menus in many languages, which is nice, and the waitress was very nice too, if a bit slow, which is normal in Spain. We seated downstairs and there was no-one else around. The décor is all right, but there were lots of flies swarming the lights in the ceiling. The morcilla arrived first, and it was fantastic, absolutely loved it. The two next tapas were more expensive, and worse too! The foie gras is exactly the same kind that you can buy at Mercadona (Martiko brand), but at a much higher price, and the bread was thin and tasteless, although I suppose that's so you can enjoy the foie gras flavour. The orange duck came with real orange, but again was nothing special. We had two glasses of wine, and the red wine was cold, which we didn't like. The price was probably what you'd expect in the centre of town (i.e. too expensive), but the quality of the food did not match it.",2014-05-24,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3470895-Reviews-or370-Taberna_la_Concha-Madrid.html,UID_1925,0.048,0.838,0.114,0.9444,0.1129142857142857,0.5806190476190476,0.6656,1012,91,0.0899209486166007,1,39,False,41,0.08,0.16,0.28,0.04,0.2,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.12,0.04,187,129,4.4171122994652405,0,0,went dinner order three tapa atillo de morcilla blood sausag foie gra mi cuit duck orang menu mani languag nice waitress nice bit slow normal spain seat downstair one els around cor right lot fli swarm light ceil morcilla arriv first fantast absolut love two next tapa expens wors foie gra exactli kind buy mercadona martiko brand much higher price bread thin tasteless although suppos enjoy foie gra flavour orang duck came real orang noth special two glass wine red wine cold like price probabl expect centr town e expens qualiti food match,bad review,2

We have ordered the hummus, which did not taste like hummus at all and all of us have eaten hummus several times in different locations before.

It is absolutely top-notch, in terms of innovation, attention to detail, service, and quality of food of course! Pictures to follow -  Food: exquisite and takes you on a truly globe-trotting fantasy Dstage took our breath away upon arrival, with TWO amazing amuse bouche dishes. The first is a nitrogen/halogen bed of crustaceans carpaccio dish framed in a wooden box, the second is when we were whisked away to the open bar, where an inviting performance of putting together the red prawn ceviche on a block of volcanic salt awaits. Exquisiteeee Several really good dishes followed, inspired by Thai and Japanese influences but utilizing the best and seasonal Spanish produce. The most wonderful thing was that wherever possible, the Dstage attendant would whisk up the dish in front of your eyes, garnished and amazingly fresh!  The main that caught us off guard was the smoked hanger steak, with the charcoal still smoking the most tender meat inside a wooden box. AMAZING - it reminded us a twinge of our Chinese ""cha siu"" (barbequed pork, yummm).  The desserts were great, the last dish looked so much like a garlic that we almost expected the meringue to taste garlicky! All in all, an absolute treat - deserves TWO stars at the very least. Wine also wonderful! Service: almost impeccable, treats you like personal friends Perhaps it's the personal touch that made us felt so well taken care of, in any case the service was great. Just took a tad long to fetch us our bill in the end - just a speck really. Ambience - a bit casual but cozy and lovely On the exterior, they maintain a very understated and dark impression, a shop front which could easily be overlooked. No signs or indications of the luxurious foodie experience that lies within.

It was the only eating place we could find in our internet trawls that advertised itself as providing gluten free food, apart from a bakery which we did not get round to visiting. We were able to get gluten free food elsewhere, with the help of preprinted cards in Spanish explaining our need, but in Taberna la Concha it was very reassuring to have a special gluten free menu available, along with gluten free bread. When you look into the front door it appears to be a very small bar with only about a half a dozen seats and patrons, however there is a seating area downstairs which is well serviced by a lady who was there both times, servicing the diners singlehandedly and jogging up and down the stairs to get the food and drinks. We tried about 7 of their tapas dishes on the 2 separate occasions we were there, sharing them between us. The food is rustic and tasty. We tasted their cava, a number of sherries and other wine. Recommended for a simple, light, healthy gluten free meal which can be had slightly earlier in the evening than the usual Spanish dining hours of after 8 or 8.30 pm",2017-05-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3470895-Reviews-or150-Taberna_la_Concha-Madrid.html,UID_24343,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.9903,0.1363008971704624,0.5197446514837819,0.4295285714285713,1151,107,0.0929626411815812,0,18,False,40,0.0434782608695652,0.2608695652173913,0.391304347826087,0.0,0.2608695652173913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0434782608695652,0.0,213,145,4.408450704225352,0,0,ate twice weeklong stay madrid eat place could find internet trawl advertis provid gluten free food apart bakeri get round visit abl get gluten free food elsewher help preprint card spanish explain need taberna la concha reassur special gluten free menu avail along gluten free bread look front door appear small bar half dozen seat patron howev seat area downstair well servic ladi time servic diner singlehandedli jog stair get food drink tri tapa dish separ occas share us food rustic tasti tast cava number sherri wine recommend simpl light healthi gluten free meal slightli earlier even usual spanish dine hour pm,good review,4

Are we glad we came. The whole experience is fabulous. The only criticism is the entrance is hard to find. There is no name that we could see on the door. We actually walked pass it twice. Once we got inside the staff were very welcoming. Only 2 choices from the menu - 10 or 14 course meal. We had the ""short"" course. Even though the servings are small but we were full afterwards. Each course came with an explanation by the staff. The whole meal was delicious. If I have to find something to criticise, the cod was too salty and the seaweed taste too overpowering.

DSTAgE is easily the best and in my view it is worthy of more than one Michelin star. Diego Guerrero is not only an innovative and highly skilled chef, he also understands that good restaurants should be about more than providing good food and wine - they should provide a performance to enhance the experience. At DSTAgE, you are introduced into the restaurant by starting in the bar with a drink and a very theatrical serving of razor clams. Then onto the kitchen bench where a chef prepares another course as you watch. Then to the table where you can watch the open kitchen at work. Finishing touches are made to a couple of the dishes at the table and the wait staff provide informative, though not pretentious or patronising, explanations of each dish - in very good English for those of us with poor Spanish. The rooms themselves are a skilled combination of casual, stylish and elegant. I also loved the soundtrack, a great combination of old classic hits that subtly reminded everyone that we are here to have fun and not take ourselves too seriously. The food itself is sublime. Wonderful, sometimes quirky and unexpected combinations of ingredients, flavours and textures. Who would think of corn flavoured ice cream wrapped in a taco made of fairy floss?! Great theatre, delicious to eat. There is an extensive wine list and we were given very good advice on a wine to suit the food and our tastes. Also very reasonably priced. If you are in Madrid, or even within 100kms, and are at all interested in great restaurant experiences, then you really should visit DSTAgE.",2016-09-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6884911-Reviews-or120-DSTAGE-Madrid.html,UID_24372,0.022,0.809,0.17,0.9941,0.3392916666666666,0.6064166666666666,0.4723666666666666,1663,143,0.0859891761876127,1,31,False,54,0.1585365853658536,0.1829268292682926,0.3170731707317073,0.073170731707317,0.1707317073170731,0.0,0.0121951219512195,0.048780487804878,0.024390243902439,0.0121951219512195,290,185,4.7379310344827585,0,0,travel week six michelin star restaur dstage easili best view worthi one michelin star diego guerrero innov highli skill chef also understand good restaur provid good food wine provid perform enhanc experi dstage introduc restaur start bar drink theatric serv razor clam onto kitchen bench chef prepar anoth cours watch tabl watch open kitchen work finish touch made coupl dish tabl wait staff provid inform though pretenti patronis explan dish good english us poor spanish room skill combin casual stylish eleg also love soundtrack great combin old classic hit subtli remind everyon fun take serious food sublim wonder sometim quirki unexpect combin ingredi flavour textur would think corn flavour ice cream wrap taco made fairi floss great theatr delici eat extens wine list given good advic wine suit food tast also reason price madrid even within km interest great restaur experi realli visit dstage,very good review,5

On hot summer afternoons we supplemented the good air conditioning with large pitchers of marvelous fruit-filled sangria that was way too good to describe adequately. On evening visits we'd have a very good albarino (18 euros per bottle) or one of various tintos that were also very good and similarly priced. Various tapas were of moderate-large size and seemingly prepared with care from fresh quality ingredients (tostadas of Iberian pork and goat cheese, large mushrooms stuffed with ham and cheese, meat balls, …) and some tapas came with small salads on the plate as well. If you elect to be less sinful and avoid tasty tapas, then their simple Mediterranean salad would suit you. Paella in Spain can be wonderful or a mistake to order, but we were pleasantly surprised by their really good vegetable paella. On some visits we had great fun chatting with the waiters or with other guests at nearby tables (halfway through a pitcher of sangria or bottle of wine). Prices here are inexpensive to moderate (certainly great value for your money). The bill for the two of us (food, alcohol, and a good tip) was generally 40-45 euros and we'd leave full and somewhat tipsy. This bar may be great for you if you want to meet people and chat, visit with a small group of friends, have a romantic first date, or have a great time with your partner of 40 years. Honestly, however, it's not the tasty food and great drink that hooks you here. It's how welcome the staff make you feel. You're at ease, comfortable, and it's fun.

It was about 2pm and a hot day so we stopped for a drink and some tapas at the H10-Bar. The location was perfect, at the beginning of la calle Huertas. The look of the food and its presentation was quite appealing, the service was quick and nice but the taste of the food was not up to expectations. We order magret de pato, arroz negro con langostinos, cazuela de langostinos, champiñones rellenos de queso y jamón y salmorejo. The duck wasn’t tender and it was cold. The rice with king prawns was plain. The small pot of king prawns too greasy. The mushrooms had a buttered bulletproof jacket...impossible to eat them.

The first time we had to wait for a table as they were busy but it was well worth the wait. The second time we booked to save messing about and were able to get to our table a few minutes early. Both times, service was excellent, friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Both times we shared a buffalo mozzarella, tomato and rocket salad which was spot on. My wife had Carbonara on both visits, having enjoyed it the first time. I had spaghetti with octopus on our first visit which was fantastic. Second time around I had ravioli con gamberi in a clam and courgette sauce, again, this was wonderful. We also shared a Ricotta and Pear cheesecake which was light as a feather and finished our meal really well.

The bathroom is clean and had lots of soap which is always something I pay attention to. The place is quite cozy with modern decorations and a cool vibe. The downstairs seating was great with romantic lighting perfect for me and my date. Music: The music was great and the waiter even asked if I had any request. So that was pretty cool!  Food:  The food was really tasty. I really enjoyed the chorizo and cheesy sweet pepper croquettes. The oreo chocolate croquette was amazing and loved how the chocolate melted inside my mouth. It was awesome! We ordered a lot of croquettes and glasses of wines and the service was fast! I felt like I was in croquette and wine heaven. The wine I loved the most matched perfectly with dessert it was sweet and just something I have never experienced before. I forget the name of the wine but just ask for a wine that goes with the cheesecake and oreo chocolate croquette they will know what you are talking about! I felt like a true Spaniard while I was here. I will totally come here again and recommend to all of my friends.,2019-01-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d15229441-Reviews-or10-Solo_De_Croquetas-Madrid.html,UID_24408,0.011,0.748,0.241,0.9935,0.3674107142857142,0.6886904761904761,0.4325333333333333,1146,104,0.0907504363001745,4,19,False,40,0.1475409836065573,0.2131147540983606,0.3114754098360656,0.0491803278688524,0.2295081967213114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0327868852459016,0.0163934426229508,208,127,4.4951923076923075,0,0,first impress employe welcom quickli offer tabl bathroom clean lot soap alway someth pay attent place quit cozi modern decor cool vibe downstair seat great romant light perfect date music music great waiter even ask request pretti cool food food realli tasti realli enjoy chorizo cheesi sweet pepper croquett oreo chocol croquett amaz love chocol melt insid mouth awesom order lot croquett glass wine servic fast felt like croquett wine heaven wine love match perfectli dessert sweet someth never experienc forget name wine ask wine goe cheesecak oreo chocol croquett know talk felt like true spaniard total come recommend friend,good review,4

I would recommend getting here early since it filled up pretty quick-there are only a few tables in this little establishment. It's located on a street with a lot of great tapas bars actually. There was only one server so I'm glad we got there early so I could ask all my questions before he got so busy. I wish I had gotten his name because he was quite phenomenal! Food was outstanding, though a lot on the sweeter side which we aren't used to yet. We tried some tapas we never tried before: the blood sausage with onion which was surprisingly good (if you can get the idea of blood sausage out of your head, it's pretty good) and their chicken one. For 6 euros, you get 2 pieces per order which for two petite women filled us up quickly (largely due to the bread base). However, we ordered some more and thank gosh the waiter advised us to get 1/3 order of the calamari and half order of the duck foie (who would've thought fraction ordering was possible?). It would've been way too much food if we had gotten the full orders and this way, we got to try almost everything we wanted to try. Both the calamari with squid ink as well as the duck foie were quite tasty.

Maybe we were unlucky but that didn't turn out to be the case for us. The tables are quite close together and the place was very busy but our waiter seemed anxious for us to hurry up and order. We wanted to take our time so ordered some wine and water and perused the menu. We asked the waiter for advice on the seafood paellas and he recommended the arroz a banda where the main seafood is cooked separately on a grill with a little bit of smaller bits cooked in the rice. The rice bit was good but the mixed seafood was way overcooked and dry. A real shame. We had shared some grilled vegetables to start and they were nice. The people at the table next to us had steak and pulpo - both looked good, so as I said, maybe we were just unfortunate.

When we arrived I asked if they had that dish, I get an affirmative answer but a strange look back from one (a mix of surprise, slight annoyance mixed in with a dimwit expression). Call my wife in that the found the right place. The restaurant looks good, one family near the entrance and a couple at a two seater mid-restaurant. A larger party of two couples was leaving as we came in. Place is definitely not crowed but the dimwit waitress motions us to another two seater right next to the couple. Only seven customers in the restaurant but here we are sitting within inches of another couple.  I didn't let that bother me (then) but as we discuss our menu choices while the other couple sitting inches away from us try to continue their conversation we wait, and we wait, and we keep on waiting. The younger dimwit waitress is busy clearing off the table of the party that just left, no doubt rushing to clear off the one table as the other 25 or so empty tables would not do in case of a rush. The other waitress just kept sitting at the cash register. My wife is still reading the menu but I put my menu down.  Can't get eye contact from the waitress at the register. I could have spoken aloud but the curt manner in which we were directed to a table right next to another couple when many tables were free and the obvious lack of rush to ask us for drink orders convinced us that we must have started off on the wrong foot with those two.  We left and had a great dinner elsewhere. This looked like it would have been a good spot but once it starts going downhill with the waitstaff, no point in staying around to have an irritating experience.",2018-01-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d988061-Reviews-or150-Restaurante_Marina_Ventura-Madrid.html,UID_24452,0.057,0.813,0.13,0.9814,0.1007335257335257,0.4270442520442521,0.3542785714285714,1743,159,0.0912220309810671,0,29,False,83,0.1052631578947368,0.087719298245614,0.2105263157894736,0.0701754385964912,0.1578947368421052,0.0526315789473684,0.0526315789473684,0.0701754385964912,0.1578947368421052,0.0350877192982456,331,191,4.256797583081571,0,0,wife want certain dish went way place recommend arriv ask dish get affirm answer strang look back one mix surpris slight annoy mix dimwit express call wife found right place restaur look good one famili near entranc coupl two seater mid restaur larger parti two coupl leav came place definit crow dimwit waitress motion us anoth two seater right next coupl seven custom restaur sit within inch anoth coupl let bother discuss menu choic coupl sit inch away us tri continu convers wait wait keep wait younger dimwit waitress busi clear tabl parti left doubt rush clear one tabl empti tabl would case rush waitress kept sit cash regist wife still read menu put menu get eye contact waitress regist could spoken aloud curt manner direct tabl right next anoth coupl mani tabl free obviou lack rush ask us drink order convinc us must start wrong foot two left great dinner elsewher look like would good spot start go downhil waitstaff point stay around irrit experi,bad review,2

It's a very attractive space, with interesting décor. It's also relatively easy to get a table, especially if you want to eat a bit earlier than the average Madrileno! It's hard to see past the paellas. We sampled two - the mixed seafood and then the chicken/rabbit/artichoke etc one. I preferred the former and my husband the latter, which probably says they were both good. We shared a starter of mixed grilled veg on our first visit, which was excellent. Next time we shared a salad of spinach, smoked duck breast and sundried tomato. This was refreshing but had a very few tiny slivers of duck which made it a bit over-priced. We had a glass of wine each at first visit, and a bottle of the same enjoyable white next evening. Both meals came to a reasonable total, including bread and water etc, of between 65 and 69 euros. Service was brisk and efficient. A little friendlier on our first visit, and we got a complimentary liqueur then too.

Trying the full tasting menu, this time with 8 associated wine choices, is an experience best not spoiled by over-detailed reviewing. Start at the bar with a fresh seafood aperitif, before moving on to the kitchen pass for a handmade pre-starter cooked (potentially, if you're lucky, by Diego himself) on something you'd probably never thinking of heating up and using as a griddle. You then head to your table, where each course is explained in careful detail, with advice on how to best to actually eat many of the dishes whose appearance and contents often leave you wishing using Google in a restaurant was good form. This year, I should note Diego's been to Thailand and China, and the fusion of these flavours with the techniques and ideas picked up on some of his previous travels is simply astounding. You'll laugh at the combinations. You'll sit wide-eyed at the beauty of the presentation. You'll run out of adjectives before the end of the evening. As I said, almost no spoilers here about the food. It's better NOT to run through the masses of photos online. Go wanting to be surprised. But, if you want one tip, request the Raviolis de alubias. Unforgettable, authentic and amusing at the same time. The service is excellent, up to and including phoning to ask about allergies in advance. The decor and lighting is simple, unfussy and comfortable. The price is nothing short of a bargain compared to other restaurants in this class. As near as you'll get, probably, to affordable Michelin dining.

A set menu for about €85 per head ensured that we were well fed, with a detailed description of what we were going to eat presented by our waitress. A number of food allergies in the group meant that some ""off-menu"" options were required, but these were dealt with with minimum fuss, and the individual wasn't made to feel awkward (which some places can do). The only criticism - and it was probably for our own good in the end - was when we asked our waitress for a dessert wine, and she went to get the menu....and never came back because her shift ended! We just made do with finishing our very good albariño instead - but their loss in terms of revenue! The most memorable dish for me was the ""reverse fabada"" - a wonderful clear broth with little ""beans"" filled with the intense taste of ham stock, and pillows filled with a bean paste. Fabulous!

Amazing well thought out dishes from start to finish and very attentive staff. I'm surprised it's only garnered 1 Michelin Star.  We had visited the restaurant before it gained its Michelin rating and were impressed with the innovative dishes coupled with impeccable service. Each dish was beautifully presented and explained by the staff. Note they offered this in both English or Spanish. They even remembered us from our first visit. Your glass was never empty and your server(s) were always close at hand.  Compared to other (1-3) Michelin star restaurants in Madrid this is by far the best overall dinning experience. While it does come with a healthy price tag it's worth every penny. We have been to other starred restaurants and vowed to never go back. Granted it's about the food but if it's served by angry and hurried Oompa Loompa /clock work orange looking staff throwing cutlery down at the table, I'll pass no matter how many stars and how famous the chef is.  We requested to be seated in view of the kitchen to watch the food preparation. On nights Diego is in the kitchen it's a treat to see the maestro at work.  Being our second time around (not our last), you can let your server know what you do and don't want. They even suggest if you have a special occasion to let them know, they will be happy to help ensure you enjoy your visit.  I look forward to returning soon!

The restaurant whilst not easy to find is beautifully laid out inside and in unusual in the Michelin experience sense in that it is very welcoming as are the DStage team.  It is worth arriving slightly ahead of your meal to start to draw in the ambience and relax, prior to your first introduction to the meal. The first course was which was a sublime cockle was presented to us at the bar on top of a bed of Konbu and with smoke from dry ice.  After we had finished our cocktail we decided to go for the 14 Course Menu option and also with drinks pairing. This turned out to be a good an interesting choice.  We were then moved to Kitchen where our Red Prawn ceviche was prepared in front of us by one of the chefs. Tasty but importantly starts to engage you with the restaurant and what they are doing here.  We moved to our table which i was pleased to be in front of the kitchen pass, so we could see the kitchen in operation. Fascinating.  No menu is presented to you until after your meal, deliberately as some of the dishes are deliberately set to trick the senses - that definitely worked and added to the experience.  i have attached pictures of many of the courses with this review so i will note attempt to describe each dish. This is pointless anyway given the changing menu.  All of the 14 dishes were perfectly presented by an expert, knowledgeable and friendly team, who made us feel very much at home. All of the food was delicious and by the end of the meal we had been taken on a complete culinary journey added by the drinks parings.  Even the music being played lightly in the background was unexpected / Springsteen, Ramones, largely 70-80's stuff . different but happens to be what like.  I can't complement enough the quality of the service, the ladies who attended to us were wonderful, friendly and knowledgeable.

Lliving in Madrid it's quite some time that we had to wait. Everything was a fantastic experience starting with the appetizer at the bar and some beers . Then we were taken into the main dining room which was large but cosy and started the 10 courses with Ceviche. I will not reveal the rest but it was fantastic including the two deserts. Some plates were really extraordinary such as the octopus. We had a little issue with one of them (the meat) but very well compensated! We had a funny bottle of wine (gallon as y focas) from Mallorca and it was another pleasant surprise. If you want a red wine with body yet light woody and earthy notes ask for it. You will love it just like the rest. Check some of the pictures.

However, having based our order on three to four dishes each as we might order in the UK when having tapas, the waitress very helpfully recommended we only have two each due to the size and she was completely correct. The portions are excellent value and very substantial. The meat platter we had was especially good and another neighbouring table had the cheese platter which was huge. The waitress who was serving covered all of the approx seven tables in the downstairs restaurant and kept diving up and downstairs with drinks orders and food orders. I don't now how she kept up the pace as she was making me tired just watching but did it all with a smile and was really pleasant throughout to all. Take a visit, we loved everything. It's slightly away from the main tourist spots in the city centre and the value and authenticity of the cuisine are, in my opinion, higher as a result",2014-11-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3470895-Reviews-or350-Taberna_la_Concha-Madrid.html,UID_22837,0.021,0.781,0.198,0.9931,0.2710317460317461,0.5392857142857144,0.4139,1202,112,0.0931780366056572,0,17,False,42,0.1,0.1666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.1,0.2333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0666666666666666,0.0,215,140,4.595348837209302,0,0,follow visit see flamenco dine tapa great taberna book fortun earli enough us accommod downstair restaur area provid us copi menu incorpor english translat made life easi order howev base order three four dish might order uk tapa waitress help recommend two due size complet correct portion excel valu substanti meat platter especi good anoth neighbour tabl chees platter huge waitress serv cover approx seven tabl downstair restaur kept dive downstair drink order food order kept pace make tire watch smile realli pleasant throughout take visit love everyth slightli away main tourist spot citi centr valu authent cuisin opinion higher result,good review,4

This was the first place we went to when we arrived. We quickly checked into our Hotel, unpacked and made our way to here for a stop of lunch. We ordered a beer each and some gorgeous tapas. It was only about 1pm but it was already getting busy. (There is an option to sit downstairs but we loved sitting at the bar and taking it all in!) We then wanted to try a red wine each, and the owner asked us what we liked....he simply gave us a red wine tasting! It was brilliant, we sampled about 4 and decided on a beautiful roja wine. Best way to start your break! Needless to say, we came back here every night or afternoon for a couple of drinks. It was always always busy and it was such a great atmosphere. My Fiance and I were there on Saturday from about 10.30pm - 2am just sitting, drinking red wine & cava, and enjoying ourselves. We must've had 5/6 glasses of wine/cava each and the bill was only about 20Euros!
