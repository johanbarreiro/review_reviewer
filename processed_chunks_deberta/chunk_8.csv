But if you aren't a beer fan then don't worry as there are plenty of other drinks to choose from. Two ladies with us had a very tasty wine. Also the food is very good, very fresh ingredients and very reasonable prices. It was 4.50 euros for anchovies with olive and peppers on toast, which i ordered and it was very delicious.

It was a snap decision but we didn't regret it. We immediately loved this place as soon as we set foot in it: it looked cozy, welcoming and absolutely beautiful. It was a pretty small place but that just made it feel intimate, with the retro-looking bar monopolising the entire space and setting a romantic, slightly nostalgic tone. We sat at the table closest to the door and ordered our drinks, which came with the tapas and chips typical of most Spanish restaurants. Next I had the paella with black rice and my boyfriend had the BBQ ribs. My paella was really good but my boyfriend's BBQ ribs were out of this world. I had a few bites out of curiosity and I feel like that taste will never leave my memory. I recommend the heck out of them. The price was decent and the waitress was reasonably nice to us - even though she didn't find much amusement in my short bit of trivia, namely that their WiFi password featured my birth year.

We walked around looking at the other restaurants nearby but they didn’t look as inviting, so we went back and asked for a table. To our amazement we were told that the restaurant was fully booked and we hadn’t reserved a table. We obviously looked disappointed so they said they’d dress a table in the window of their bar area for us which was so good of them. The food, service and wine were excellent and the vibe was great when the other diners arrived. Lovely ambience too and the window table was a treat for us watching everyone pass by outside.

They have an awesome lunch special for 13.5 Euros, which includes a drink, first plate, second plate and dessert. We sat outside at the terrace, which was lovely and decorated with plants. The owner and the staff have done a wonderful job on that. I actually met the owner Delawar and the guy was funny and super friendly. He gave us some free shots and additional drinks while we were there. The service was great too. They have these disciplined Indian workers who come by all the time. They speak multiple languages so if you only know English, that won't be a problem. They will be able to service you.  The food was absolutely delicious. I love eating the creamy curry there. I have also tried the Keema Curry before and that was delicious too. After that curry taste, you can finish off with one of their wonderful ice cream dishes. I like the pistachio ice cream. Yummy!

Except the lady that served us, we didn't feel welcome at all by anyone in the staff including the person who looked like the manager. Here I must say that their behaviour towards non Indians was completely opposite. I could see it from my table how their mannerism changed when they were talking to others. They were more friendly and cordial. With us, they were just loud, rude and curt. To top it all, the food was bad and extremely spicy. I don't remember eating anything which was remotely good.

The restaurant was amazing. It is one of the best Indians I have ever had. The staff were very helpful when ordering and recommended just one starter to share. We went for onion bhajis which were delicious and just the right amount for 2 of us.  For mains I went for chicken jalfrezi which was delicious. The waitress asked what spice I would like and recommended mild and it was just right. The curries are usually slightly hotter than what we would get in England. My partner went for chicken tikka masala and really enjoyed it. We only went for one rice and one naan to share between us as this was recommended and this turned out to be a perfect sized portion.

Although some might consider the interior to be on the quirkier side of the spectrum (especially the cereal room - as we now know, there's a story associated with it, but you'll have to visit to hear it), we ourselves found it adorable and really cosy.  The owner immediately made us feel at home and kept us entertained through the evening with a friendly chat about the restaurant's history, food and the local area.  Both the dishes we had (Spanish omelet and arroz negra) were amazing - the seafood for paella is indeed very fresh and the taste is to die for.  Pricing is very reasonable, especially considering the location.  We will definitely come back and will be recommending Real Talent to all our friends.  ¡Muchas gracias!

Starters were nice and wasn't much of a wait, however, when the Chicken Caesar salad came out the chicken was still raw. When we approached the manager to explain he just laughed and said "" let me sort that for you"" and not even an apology. The meal that came back was the same as we handed over but now with grilled chicken instead of it being raw, which i would have thought they would have made a fresh meal for us - the rest of our meals were fine.  When we went to pay for the meal we were owed £8 change, the staff assumed this was a tip, but why would we tip when we were served raw food and laughed at? so we asked for our change and the other manager said "" this is a tip"" and wasn't happy that we asked for it back and when we did get it back we were still short changed.

Great thing in the concept is you can decide either beef or ox for the patty, choose the size of it, choose the bread and the side dish: Perfect Burger concept. The presentation of the salad was really good, however too much sauce: a Thai sauce quite sweet, sadly too sweet as too much sauce.  The burger presentation was also really good, however I asked for rare and the burger was cold in the middle: For a burger joint, they should know how to cook it perfectly.

They put a signboard outside advertising a set menu brunch for 14 euros. You order and eat then comes a bill for 17 euros. They bring out the menu and show the tiny little print saying their ""mini-brunch"" is 14 euros. And the larger brunch is 17 euros. But the signboard says nothing about MINI-brunch. Basically, it's a sneaky way to cheat tourists out of 3 euros. Did not see any Spanish people eating there while I was there. It's a shame because the food was quite good, the service prompt, and included a large fresh blend of juices. However, most of the brunch is cheap stuff like bread, eggs, lettuce, and coffee.

There is a menu in English if you need it. We sampled 4 dishes from the tapas menu - all made from fresh ingredients - all delicious. Especially liked the black sausage and the pork in tomato sauce. The best though was the fish - simply pan fried with home made chips. This very much a family affair and Pepe head of the clan educated us on the ways of Spanish food and drink. He gave us typed instructions on how to make Sangria and a breakdown of the origin & components of all the dishes we chose. All this delivered in a very entertaining ""Pepe style"". Before we left we were treated to a nightcap of the house - a kinda Baileys with whipped cream and then he gave us a range of presents from cap to key ring. But the best surprise was the final bill.

Up until this stop we had had limited success in finding something we could call home.  Well look no further because Steakburger is the place to go. We had the BBQ (Beef) Burger while my brother in-law the BBQ (Ox) Burger. Yes, they make burgers out of Ox as well. My wife had the BBQ Ribs which were excellent.  All of this food for a very reasonable price. However, the best part of the meal was the wonderful service given to us by Marcos. Marcos appears to be running the show at this well-run establishment. Great food, great prices, great service and most of great management from Marcos.  It was so good that we decided to go back the same night for dinner. Problem was the restaurant was closing at 12:00 midnight and we arrived at 11:55pm. No problem for Marcos who not only made sure we got some food, he made sure it was very fresh as well. This time we all got the Ribs but Marcos also threw in some dessert (Apple Crumble Pie).

This is a modest, non touristy area. Las Campanillas felt very homey.  I ordered a half serving of calamares. Pepe explained that ""the women were eating"" and there would be a half hour delay. I took that to mean that the cooks were having their meal break. Fine. I relaxed with a nice Mahou and the olives Pepe brought. A few minutes later he brought a tapa of chorizo on the house. Delicious. The calamares arrived as promised. They didn't have the crunchy coating that we get in the US, but there was a much fresher squid flavor. Just a little lemon juice was all they needed.

First I must say that I just love tapas and places like this. Where people have their heart with it. I ended up staying night next to airport between my two flights and of course seeked (from tripadvisor) what to eat. Found Campanillas! Yes, it's true, you miss it if you do not know it. And even you would know you still think other places ""look nicer"" or have better entrances or lights in window etc. No. Try it. Do favor to yourself! If you want white table cloth or hate friendly, home made tapas then you might catch some fancy italian or McD somewhere. Otherwise if you are around go there and you find lovely family run tapas bar with attentive service. Owner Pepe has stories to tell. In any language. And if you do not speak spanish (like I don't) it doesn't matter. You will learn, someone will help. Or you just smile and enjoy.  So what did I do there? I stepped in and asked to get dinner - got menu. But turned away from it and told Pepe that he probably knows better what I need. And he did. Served many different things, I think I ate 4 plates (few small, few very big - meatballs was so to say main course, ah so lovely!) and was really full. During all this we were speaking a lot of football, travelling, Pepes history and stuff. People all over have sent photos, post cards ... everything, bar is decorated with memories. He has some fans.

It took me a subway ride to get here and a meandering walk down some side streets but eventually, I made it. And I'm glad I made the trek. The owner was kind and gracious, ready to answer any questions I had about the menu. The cafe is kitschy and bright, small but comfortable, and WiFi is free!

For 13.50 each (a steal) we got a starter, entree, dessert and drink. Every single dish was either good or amazing and we were pretty stuffed by the end. My favourites were their vegetable pakora, perfect chana masala and both kulfi and mango lassi for dessert. I asked the chana to be spicy and they made it with just the right level of spice.

Pepe made us feel us like very special guests, told us fun stories, kept us company, treated us to some free ""tapas"" and even gave us a little souvenir of Madrid. We loved his company and the food he served, which was freshly made by his wife.

The manager said it was not possible as he had another table coming at 10.30pm. I was surprised we would only be allotted 1.5 hours but he said this was how things were done when you booked online. As we were taking the train in from Toledo, we had to rush to the restaurant and arrived by 9.15pm. The main server seems to be the owner. He was pleasant enough but has a major chip on his shoulder. While he was serving someone at the table a cocktail, a little bit fell into my companion's wine. He said sorry and took away the glass, we assumed he would replace it, but nothing happened. When he saw us talking about this, he brought back the glass saying ""oh well if you still want it, here you go."" Through the night, he seemed kind of cocky and not helpful when ordering.  Funnily enough, during my trip to Spain, I had at least one waiter drop a drink on the table or on me or on someone at the table each day. Overall, servers aren't very bothered by this so I guess it's something we had to get used to. The food here is quite good, apart from the overuse of nachos in a few dishes, you will be very happy with the quality and portions of the dishes. The flavours are authentic and the sauces they serve on the side, are delicious! The cocktails sound lovely but are all very watered down so apart from the margarita's, stick to the wine (and protect it with your life).  If it weren't for the owner/server's attitude, I would have given this a four-star review. Also, we left the restaurant at 11.30pm and there was no other table waiting, hence we could have easily arrived a little later, more comfortably.",2018-10-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13274025-Reviews-or10-Me_gustas_MXO-Madrid.html,UID_6619,0.032,0.842,0.126,0.9899,0.1830928330928331,0.5553270803270803,0.29773125,1748,180,0.102974828375286,1,54,False,61,0.1,0.2,0.28,0.12,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.04,333,200,4.246246246246246,0,0,book tabl larg group pm saturday afternoon call ask could move pm manag said possibl anoth tabl come pm surpris would allot hour said thing done book onlin take train toledo rush restaur arriv pm main server seem owner pleasant enough major chip shoulder serv someon tabl cocktail littl bit fell companion wine said sorri took away glass assum would replac noth happen saw us talk brought back glass say oh well still want go night seem kind cocki help order funnili enough trip spain least one waiter drop drink tabl someon tabl day overal server bother guess someth get use food quit good apart overus nacho dish happi qualiti portion dish flavour authent sauc serv side delici cocktail sound love water apart margarita stick wine protect life owner server attitud would given four star review also left restaur pm tabl wait henc could easili arriv littl later comfort,average review,3

Forget the food, forget the wine, forget the surroundings, just enjoy the experience. We were fortunate in that we had a friend with us who spoke fluent Spanish so we left the ordering to him though in fact what we were served was decided by Pepe who has some English albeit limited. This is not a high-end restaurant but excels in what our friend described as typical Madrid-style home cooking. Some dishes we loved, one or two not to our taste. The wine was again chosen by Pepe who insisted we try several. Constant visits to our table to chat about rugby, soccer, food, wine, sharing jokes added to the pleasure of the evening. Something very different from the usual restaurant visit. Campanillas is a place where ordinary Spaniards go for home-cooked food, watch football on TV and share a glass of wine or two with friends. It should be approached on that basis. Hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised. You'll certainly be satisfied with the very modest bill you'll receive at the end of the evening.",2015-10-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4062487-Reviews-or70-Restaurante_Campanillas-Madrid.html,UID_7990,0.018,0.734,0.248,0.9952,0.1098179271708683,0.4797759103641457,0.5654818181818182,1124,98,0.0871886120996441,0,27,False,41,0.0784313725490196,0.1764705882352941,0.3137254901960784,0.0196078431372549,0.196078431372549,0.0392156862745098,0.0196078431372549,0.0196078431372549,0.0980392156862745,0.0392156862745098,195,130,4.769230769230769,0,0,read review restaur look forward meet pepe disappoint forget food forget wine forget surround enjoy experi fortun friend us spoke fluent spanish left order though fact serv decid pepe english albeit limit high end restaur excel friend describ typic madrid style home cook dish love one two tast wine chosen pepe insist tri sever constant visit tabl chat rugbi soccer food wine share joke ad pleasur even someth differ usual restaur visit campanilla place ordinari spaniard go home cook food watch footbal tv share glass wine two friend approach basi hope pleasantli surpris certainli satisfi modest bill receiv end even,good review,4

His English is not great, and my Spanish is poor, but with Pepe's help we had a great meal. We shared a salad and the chicken and pork kabobs, all of which was very good. Pepe brought us three kinds of appetizers that were all tasty. I asked him to make us some sangria, so he brought everything to the table and made us a full pitcher (a bargain for 10 euros) that was the best I've ever had. He later threw in some dessert at no extra charge. We will be in Spain for 10 days, and I suspect this will be the best dinner we will have. For all we had the price was about 32 euros, which would be a good deal in the US, and even more so in Europe. If in the area, I would recommend a visit here without reservation.

Ask for Pepe! He has a lot of personality and we just let him bring us food (all of it excellent) until we'd had enough. He did ask if there were any dietary restrictions, which for us was not an issue, but it is good to know he was thinking of the possibility. Come early (Spanish early = 9) as the place fills up with locals. We had a small pitcher of sangria (made fresh at our table) and a few combo platters of traditional pub food: calamari, croquetas, fries (with garlic aioli and 'spicy' sauce), tortilla de patata, meatballs, mussels, jamon, oh and for dessert a few lovely little homemade truffles of chocolate heaven.  Enjoy the ambiance and the chance to be Spanish for an evening- don't rush it! The food is worth every minute!

We found this place on Trip Advisor and realized it was 600 meters from our hotel near the airport. Too tired to go across town we gave it a shot and walked down the street. At first we weren't sure it was even open but we had just come so early - our body clocks were out of synch with local time and we were hungry by 6:15pm. Met Pepe as we entered and sat at a very nice little home-spun dining room with red checked table cloths. My were were we in for a treat. I'm not sure which we liked more, the great food or the wonderful conversation and delightful time with Pepe, his wife and daughter. He kept bringing out samples and extras that just made the experience a perfect evening. We talked about the spices he uses, the places they come from, how it's made. And basically I loved the fact that he told us what we should order. He suggested - and we agreed - to each get something and share the flavor with the other. The anchovy on potato chips was superb. My wife loved the black pudding appetizer. The salmon was great and the entrecote steak so flavorful. Dessert was amazing - flan and rice pudding and he kept showing is unique features and spices to put on it. We loved it when Pepe sat and told us the story about how he started the place 43 years ago and how he's been married 30 years - happy and thriving. It was a perfect evening. Although he may not be able to spend as much time with everyone if the place is full at 9pm, I am sure he loves to meet each person who walks through the door. The value was amazing. His hand-written menu on a piece of spiral paper torn out of a notebook was written especially for English speakers who can't navigate the Spanish. The set price of 12 Euros included everything and it was well worth the bill. The quality and taste was great. But the experience made it a truly unforgettable experience. Not a superficial, glitzy bar. But a true Spanish community place that you'll remember. It's a great place to add to your list of things in Madrid.",2015-06-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4062487-Reviews-or70-Restaurante_Campanillas-Madrid.html,UID_8020,0.019,0.738,0.243,0.9991,0.3735317460317461,0.6150624788922662,0.3111269230769231,2136,195,0.0912921348314606,0,49,False,82,0.1558441558441558,0.1558441558441558,0.2597402597402597,0.0519480519480519,0.1558441558441558,0.0259740259740259,0.0259740259740259,0.0259740259740259,0.1038961038961039,0.0389610389610389,405,246,4.276543209876543,0,0,visit campanilla absolut right choic even madrid flight want wast found place trip advisor realiz meter hotel near airport tire go across town gave shot walk street first sure even open come earli bodi clock synch local time hungri pm met pepe enter sat nice littl home spun dine room red check tabl cloth treat sure like great food wonder convers delight time pepe wife daughter kept bring sampl extra made experi perfect even talk spice use place come made basic love fact told us order suggest agre get someth share flavor anchovi potato chip superb wife love black pud appet salmon great entrecot steak flavor dessert amaz flan rice pud kept show uniqu featur spice put love pepe sat told us stori start place year ago marri year happi thrive perfect even although may abl spend much time everyon place full pm sure love meet person walk door valu amaz hand written menu piec spiral paper torn notebook written especi english speaker navig spanish set price euro includ everyth well worth bill qualiti tast great experi made truli unforgett experi superfici glitzi bar true spanish commun place rememb great place add list thing madrid,very good review,5

We took his advice and were not disappointed. Tapas of the day - mussels topped with onions, celery and tomato, plus a few slices of very good Jamon carved off the bone before us. Tried the potato omelette, meat balls in potato sauce, fried 'shark', some roasted peppers and a couple of glasses of wine - 22Euro and more than we could eat.

Pepe is an engaging fellow who wants you to taste his food and will accommodate your interests by delivering samples of items. I loved the meatballs and calamari and little treats continued to be provided across my meal. There is a patio with umbrellas at which you can sit and enjoy the sun and it isn't noisy as there is a hedge around the cafe which gives privacy. While many restaurants near airport locations tend to be pricey and not terribly good, this one is reasonable and very good and Pepe seems genuinely interested in his international guests.

You wouldn't think that combination could make magic, but this place is truly INCREDIBLE! We were lucky enough to find this place as it's a bit tucked away and requires some searching, but it is an absolute gem of a restaurant.  To start, the decor is chic without being pretentious and blends the comfortable culture of Madrid with the practicality and edginess of Asian island cultures. The bar tender whips up a mean Pisco Sour that shouldn't be missed and is a great way to start what is about to be an incredible journey of the tastebuds. We went all out and ordered several dishes. We started with the Chipirones de Anzuelo, which come in a perfectly battered panko crust. We then had what was our absolute favourite dish of the evening - the Bao de Panceta (or Pan Bao). They suggest you eat it shortly after ordering as the bread is fresh from the oven and the insanely tender pork absolutely melts in your mouth. Honestly, you could go here to order this dish at least three times. The palm sugar based sauce is also part of the magic to this dish. We followed with the Carrillera de Turner and the Presa de Ibérico. Both full of incredibly unique flavours that mix the best of Thai and Spanish cuisines. For dessert we ordered the Chef's ""mess"", which included a beautiful assortment of fresh berries, citrus, sorbet, and ice cream. Though it does end up looking like a huge mess of tasty treats when all is said and done, when delivered to your table it's almost too beautiful to eat. Almost being the key word, of course. You simply can't miss this place on your visit to Madrid. The chef is a genius and the flavours are some of the most incredible. we've tasted to date. From top to bottom this restaurant is one of the best we've ever had the pleasure of visiting.

Unpretentious setting and quiet yet attentive staff.

My favourite dish was the Tataki tuna which was a fusion of flavours. I cannot think of the right adjective to do it justice. We also loved the red pork curry.

Both the front & the rear section of the restaurant are nicely decorated, very clean and appealing. As many people have pointed out, the fried plantains served with salsa and guacamole are incredible ! They have a nice selection of Spanish beers, and a decent selection of wines. My wife had a nice vino blanco and I had a Spanish beer from the tap. Since we had already embarked on the Tapas route, our next dish was nachos, covered in cheese and salsa. Nicely done, and went with my beer very nicely!! Our final dish was the prawns in garlic sauce and they were also exquisite ! The sauce was awesome and the prawns were obviously fresh.  Our servers spoke excellent English, and were very helpful in helping us order.

This was the front of the restaurant however there may be more seating in the back that we did not notice.  The ambiance is nice and chilled, staff were young gentlemen who took utmost care of the customers ensuring all was going well and recommending different dishes. Was a homey and friendly feeling. The food was delicious, we had the some arepas that cane with four dips (definitely take), then a three layered arrepa and a traditional large arepa filled with meat and cheese (not on menu was recommended). The last was the pulpo which was out of this world, definitely do not miss it!  We ordered a jar of sangria which they make from scrach and have a personal secret touch which is delicious, you can taste its freshly made.

Wow! The experience was superb, from the cozy yet contemporary design fitted with high quality materials, the friendly attentive servers, to the small but outstanding fresh seafood. I had the grilled octopus (pulpo) starter, which was served in a fresh lettuce wrap, delicately seasoned with a hint of watercress and black roe aioli. The octopus melted on the palate.  That was followed by an equally tender grilled fatty tuna, with finely chopped red onion and hint of ginger. The tuna was served well done but had a silky almost creamy texture - just delightful. Nicely accompanied with a glass of Raimat Abadia D.O. (Cabernet and Tempranillo).

There are so many places here but the food is so good I just keep going back. The sharing steak is unbelievable and ONLY €25! It is served with roasted peppers and onions and homemade wedges. However, I would suggest ordering a side dish (The items on the menu for roughly €7-8) as it is slightly on the small side but incredibly cheap for the quality of meat you get.  I have tried various items off the menu now and can also confirm that the paella is amazing, without a doubt one of the best ones i've had while in Madrid.  The cocktails are also very good, a little pricy but this is very common in the capital city. They are very aesthetically impressive.

The combination of terrific...","We are New Yorkers and have been on vacation for a week in Europe. We have eaten some terrific meals, but for overall experience our evening tonight at Rosi La Loca Taberna was absolutely the best eating experience of our vacation. The combination of terrific food at an incredibly reasonable price and the “over the top” warmth and friendliness of the restaurant staff, who truly could not do enough for us, made the dinner more than a meal, it felt like a family experience. From our servers Gloria and Adam, to the manager Alejandro (who spent many years living in New Jersey), to our hostess Eva (who literally went the extra mile to assist us in getting a reservation at a sister restaurant for tomorrow), to Richard (already a Trip Advisor Legend in reviews we had seen prior to booking) - everyone treated us like 10 year regulars instead of like the tourists we were. Their warmth and genuine interest in us, in addition to their excellent service, made the experience memorable.  While being well treated was wonderful, the quality of the food for the price took the experience to another level of enjoyment. We started with burrata infused with a hypodermic filled with olive oil and pesto, in a tomato based immersion. We then had tenderloin of pork with sweet potato chips and applesauce that was perfectly tender and delicious. My wife is not a pork lover, and she found herself wanting more of this delicate dish. The next appetizer was tuna tataki, which was served in a gondola “floating” in dry ice. The tuna was rare and perfectly marinated in soy sauce and Japanese spices, and topped with an aoli cream sauce and sitting on a bed of seaweed. I am a huge tuna lover and I order it in restaurants frequently. This was among the best tuna dishes I have ever eaten. Its excellence required a second order - which was consumed even more quickly than the first.  We then had the chicken and seafood paella, which was served in the Spanish style for 3 - and was plentiful. The rice was done perfectly - neither too “al dente” nor mushy. The sauce was delicious. The seafood and chicken cooked perfectly. It was a treat. All the while, Alejandro, Adam and Gloria were checking in frequently to assure our satisfaction - mostly they heard as “oohing” and “aahing”over the quality of the food. They were accessible without hovering.  Finally, after eating a tremendous amount of excellent food, and very good (and not expensive) wine, it was time for dessert - sadly, we only had room to split one. The brownie with ice cream was like lava cake and disappeared almost upon Gloria placing it on the table. As we went upstairs to pay the check by credit card, we encountered Richard, who also asked about our meal. Feeling like family by now, we told him of the pleasurable evening we were having, and he insisted on providing, on the house, one additional treat. He reached into the fridge and removed limoncello shots in test tube like containers, which we shook and downed.  Having finished an incredible evening, Alejandro told us they had a sister restaurant around the corner, named InClan, and we eagerly agreed to dine there tomorrow. Eva then worked some magic to get us a reservation, again treating us like family. We can;t wait to try InClan tomorrow - if it’s half as good as our overall experience tonight, we’ll be satisfied. I realize in reading such a rave review you might wonder if we were somehow connected to the restaurant. I assure you we are tourists from New York (I have many other reviews on line in TripAdvisor) and have never seen this place or the people who were so incredible before tonight. We thank Gloria, Alejandro, Adam, Richard and the enchanting Eva for making us so very happy not because of the great food, but because we were treated like family. We highly recommend this place - a trip to Madrid won’t be complete without a visit.",2018-11-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7204621-Reviews-or490-Rosi_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_8159,0.017,0.741,0.242,0.9996,0.3569018543645409,0.6169199457259157,0.414484375,3881,306,0.0788456583354805,0,89,False,120,0.1213872832369942,0.1907514450867052,0.2716763005780346,0.0635838150289017,0.1907514450867052,0.0231213872832369,0.0231213872832369,0.0289017341040462,0.0520231213872832,0.0346820809248554,684,376,4.669590643274854,0,0,new yorker vacat week europ eaten terrif meal overal experi even tonight rosi la loca taberna absolut best eat experi vacat combin terrif food incred reason price top warmth friendli restaur staff truli could enough us made dinner meal felt like famili experi server gloria adam manag alejandro spent mani year live new jersey hostess eva liter went extra mile assist us get reserv sister restaur tomorrow richard alreadi trip advisor legend review seen prior book everyon treat us like year regular instead like tourist warmth genuin interest us addit excel servic made experi memor well treat wonder qualiti food price took experi anoth level enjoy start burrata infus hypoderm fill oliv oil pesto tomato base immers tenderloin pork sweet potato chip applesauc perfectli tender delici wife pork lover found want delic dish next appet tuna tataki serv gondola float dri ice tuna rare perfectli marin soy sauc japanes spice top aoli cream sauc sit bed seawe huge tuna lover order restaur frequent among best tuna dish ever eaten excel requir second order consum even quickli first chicken seafood paella serv spanish style plenti rice done perfectli neither al dent mushi sauc delici seafood chicken cook perfectli treat alejandro adam gloria check frequent assur satisfact mostli heard ooh aah qualiti food access without hover final eat tremend amount excel food good expens wine time dessert sadli room split one browni ice cream like lava cake disappear almost upon gloria place tabl went upstair pay check credit card encount richard also ask meal feel like famili told pleasur even insist provid hous one addit treat reach fridg remov limoncello shot test tube like contain shook down finish incred even alejandro told us sister restaur around corner name inclan eagerli agre dine tomorrow eva work magic get us reserv treat us like famili wait tri inclan tomorrow half good overal experi tonight satisfi realiz read rave review might wonder somehow connect restaur assur tourist new york mani review line tripadvisor never seen place peopl incred tonight thank gloria alejandro adam richard enchant eva make us happi great food treat like famili highli recommend place trip madrid complet without visit,good review,4

When we arrived at 7.15PM we were told they only start dinner service at 7.30PM which wasn't a problem for us. We were then served bread and cold cuts on the house. We ordered 1 appetizer and 2 mains to share between 2 people and were queried if its too much for us. It was a kind gesture by the bartender / waiter but because we only had churros for lunch we were pretty hungry after walking around the city the whole day so we went ahead.  The fried cheese appetizer was delightful. We ordered steak and pork fillets for mains however was served pork ribs and pork fillets so was quite disappointing. However initially I wanted to ordered the ribs as well so was half ok with the mistake. The pork fillet was tender and delicious but the ribs weren't great and dry. Both servings was huge and could see why our order was queried initially.  1 appetizer + 2 mains + 2 beers came to less than 30 Euros.  *Also the menu del dia that many has mentioned previously is only available for lunch.,2019-08-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4829641-Reviews-Bar_Selva-Madrid.html,UID_3731,0.062,0.797,0.141,0.9468,0.221875,0.6274305555555556,0.5572818181818182,1055,90,0.0853080568720379,0,20,False,45,0.1463414634146341,0.1951219512195122,0.2439024390243902,0.024390243902439,0.1707317073170731,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439,0.1219512195121951,0.073170731707317,199,130,4.291457286432161,0,0,visit bar selva due good review ta pleas arriv pm told start dinner servic pm problem us serv bread cold cut hous order appet main share peopl queri much us kind gestur bartend waiter churro lunch pretti hungri walk around citi whole day went ahead fri chees appet delight order steak pork fillet main howev serv pork rib pork fillet quit disappoint howev initi want order rib well half ok mistak pork fillet tender delici rib great dri serv huge could see order queri initi appet main beer came less euro also menu del dia mani mention previous avail lunch,bad review,2

We were therefore struggling to find places that we could both happily eat in.  Whilst my husband tucked into cuts of ham, the chef made for me a wonderful pasta dish that was truly delicious. We were so well looked after, and the owner made a huge effort to make us feel welcome and included. The atmosphere was cosy, relaxed and fun!  We will definitely be returning to this restaurant on our next visit to Madrid. Prefect for lunch or dinner.  Thank you for a great evening.

We were delighted that David remembered us as he so warmly welcomed us like friends upon arrival. It felt as if we were visiting old friends, but friends that not only make the best Tapas in Madrid but also have the most wonderful selection of small producer wines as well. All the selections on the menu are generous and designed to share, and all made to order. David expertly describes every dish and its preparation, including the local sourcing of the ingredients.. even down to which town and farm! As before, we left the wine pairing to David as he is a master at choosing the perfect wine to accompany each dish and even remembered our preferences from our last visit. After all, we were among friends and not just dining out! We started our adventure with the best Scallop Ceviche we have ever tasted, the sweetness of the scallop perfectly balanced by the tart sauce. Crisp in texture and tasting of the ocean, truly magic upon the tongue!  We followed the a very tender and fresh veal carpaccio dressed with the signature house olive oil, made by a friend from single variety grapes and produced in one farm only. So good we were tempted to have it by the glass. Next we enjoyed our absolute favorite from last year, the Baby Habitas with Grilled Chipis. Truly a dish to enjoy again and again with the habitas meltingly soft and a perfect counterpoint to the sweet and crunchy grilled calamari.  We could not finish our Tapas feast without trying the Lingote de Cochinillo, a wonderful slow cooked pulled pork creation served with the in season boletus mushrooms and a confit of figs cooked in port.. ESTUPENDO!!! Torrijas con Helado, a chupito of Pedro Ximénez and expressos revived us for our ride back to Malasana. Make sure to reserve a table if you are having dinner as there are only a few and it is always full with the local crowd.",2019-12-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8727668-Reviews-Divino_Tinto-Madrid.html,UID_72,0.0,0.729,0.271,0.9991,0.3257180361982191,0.513627564847077,0.3412647058823529,1986,169,0.0850956696878147,8,35,False,70,0.1710526315789473,0.1842105263157894,0.3552631578947368,0.0657894736842105,0.1973684210526315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0131578947368421,0.0131578947368421,357,216,4.560224089635854,0,0,discov divino tinto last visit madrid year top must return restaur citi delight david rememb us warmli welcom us like friend upon arriv felt visit old friend friend make best tapa madrid also wonder select small produc wine well select menu gener design share made order david expertli describ everi dish prepar includ local sourc ingredi even town farm left wine pair david master choos perfect wine accompani dish even rememb prefer last visit among friend dine start adventur best scallop cevich ever tast sweet scallop perfectli balanc tart sauc crisp textur tast ocean truli magic upon tongu follow tender fresh veal carpaccio dress signatur hous oliv oil made friend singl varieti grape produc one farm good tempt glass next enjoy absolut favorit last year babi habita grill chipi truli dish enjoy habita meltingli soft perfect counterpoint sweet crunchi grill calamari could finish tapa feast without tri lingot de cochinillo wonder slow cook pull pork creation serv season boletu mushroom confit fig cook port estupendo torrija con helado chupito pedro xim nez expresso reviv us ride back malasana make sure reserv tabl dinner alway full local crowd,good review,4

Although in the wrong direction for where we were going next, it looked worth a go. So glad we did. It was tiny but full of locals and no other tourists (always the best to my mind) and I could see why once they managed to squeeze us in despite no reservation. It remained packed and people constantly trying to get in throughout our time there.  Our waiter was a lovely, warm and engaging guy. He recommended a few things to us which looked and sounded great but sadly we were only there for a light lunch so didn’t go for them but if we came back, we would. We went with a couple of very simple things - patatas bravas and manchego cheese which were both perfect. We also tried a new dish (for us) which was mushrooms and crispy spinach cooked with raisins and Pedro Ximenez - outstanding and one of the best tapas dishes we have ever had.  Couple of small beers and a glass of wonderful Ribera Del Duero (always blows my mind that I get a glass like this for less than €3 vs what I get in London!) made this the perfect lunch! If we come back to Madrid, we will defo come back here - could not recommend it enough.

As it was a few years since I was last there, many of the restaurants that I liked in the Cheuca area have closed, so went to Esplore as a result of good reviews on here. Went alone on a Thursday night and had: starter - the morcilla (Spanish black pudding which I love) on toast with goats' cheese - for me, a wonderful combination of flavours and textures; for main course I had the rice with prawns and asparagus - was expecting the usual of, in Spanish restaurants, white asparagus but was fresh green asparagus which was a wonderful compliment to the prawns and the tomato based sauce of the rice; and a glass of a great Albarinho wine. Only ""criticism"" is that the portions were too big for me, but I have come to expect that in most spanish restaurants. Food is modern Spanish, so ""with a twist"" on traditional foodstuffs and dishes I booked a table for me and my friends for the Saturday night and they too loved the food and great service.

The place was still empty (it was early, as I mentioned) and we were seated in the area in the back of the entrance. Be aware that this place is very small (smaller than it looks in the pictures) and especially in the entrance it will be difficult to find a table to sit. We were informed by the waitress that we couldn't order fried eggs and we should go for poached eggs, which were their specialty, which was OK with us. We had 2 espressos and the eggs benedict with bacon, which were very tasty.

Make sure to book ahead as there only a few tables for dining and this wine bar is truly a local hangout and very busy at night, but not noisy. David tends bar, takes orders and serves the tapas all with amazing cheer and charm. We enjoyed our tapas with vermouth's to start and four wines, plus a dessert wine as suggested by David. All from small Spanish bodegas, all luscious and satisfying! We would have sampled more but we had an early train from Atocha the next morning.

The paella was so over cooked that the mussels and clams were dried out. Not just tough but dry. The mussel shells crumbled trying to open them. Another sign of overcooked. The rice in the paella did not have one filament of saffron. When I gave the feedback, the server came back with some jumbled excuses around that is how it comes in. Was it just reheated?

Walking into the restaurant we had high hopes because the decor and lighting made for a good first impression. I can’t say I felt the same way upon leaving this restaurant. Overall, the server was friendly and attentive, but the food was quite underwhelming. We decided to try the Paella to get a sense of a staple Spain dish, but this dish completely missed the mark. The Paella was not very flavorful and was too crunchy to actually savor (i.e., burnt). Maybe if we had purchased a more expensive dish the the quality would have been better, but for a dish as simple and staple as Paella, I expected a lot more. While I’ve seen a lot of positive reviews of this restaurant, nothing really stood out to us enough to recommend to someone.

To put it briefly, the food was nice but the dishes we had were not particularly special. The best dish was a starter, the goat cheese with pesto. The other dishes were ok, but not great. For example, the bbq ribs portion was massive, slattered in bbq sauce, and accompanied by plain fried potato balls with mayo. The dish would have benefitted from some variation. Another dish, the duck, suffered from the fact that the puree was tastier than the duck, which was slightly underdone in some parts. Finally, we ended up giving a tip (10%), but instead of being thanked the response was ""ok"". I'm sure this is just a one-off experience, but it did not fit the other reviews we had read.

We had tiny boiled potatoes that were bathed in wonderful red sauce from the Canary Islands. Then the most delcious curried mussels. The mussels wonderfully fresh, the curry gravey divine. We also had grilled asparagus with a light cheese topping of some sort that was perfect and great desserts. Along with a bottle of wine, the bill for two was about 63 euros.

How many times can you eat oily mediocre ham and heavy croquetas with lukewarm tortilla? I love Madrid, and have lived here but I understand that sometimes that craving for something different, something a little fresher is too hard to ignore. So. La Taberna is very good. But to me, it was my personal standard of good. Yes, the ingredients were fresh, a little different and a little lighter than what I had been eating all week. The Guacamole was....guac. What can I say? It was as good as any. And the pork skewar was very tender and nice, but the same as you could get for a dollar from a vendor in a street cart in New York. The rabbit was wonderfully tender but very salty and overpowered the braising liquid.

It was right under our noses the whole time - We took a cab to Taberna Gastromaquia and felt at home the minute we walked in. (dopey mistake to take a cab when it was a 10 minute walk plus the guy gave us the 10 Euro tour getting there, but I suppose we deserved it.) Food involves modern takes on Spanish classics. Wine was splendid and the only slight disappointment was a big dish of octopus in cheese sauce which was almost inedibly rich. Hugo (who's the chef and a terrific host as you can tell by the reviews)conferred with us about everything, and was a delight. He was sad that we didn't care that much for the octopus but everything else was lovely. Dessert was a sorbet which was some of the best I have ever had, and my friend had a frappe of some sort that we both fought over to scrape the last bite. Just a totally fun evening in a place that's doing well because of Trip Advisor, but not taking any of it for granted.
