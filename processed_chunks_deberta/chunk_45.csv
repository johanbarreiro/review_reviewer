Our waiter informed us that while the new menu featured their most popular croquetas, it now also featured more varied tapas and platos. We shared the marinated boletus salad to start and the foie turrón, simply amazing! The foie turrón s something we had never tasted before but it is now reason enough for us to cross the Atlantic! Of course we had to have croquetas.. the boletus and truffle and the pork pibil croquetas reminded us why we were so eager to return. Next we had the Japo Coca with marinated Galician octopus and the Bocata Bao, fusion cooking at its best. Galicia has been serving octopus for hundreds of years before it became trendy and it was tender and beautifully presented, as was the Bao. Our waiter treated us to Mojito sorbets and they were just the right touch before dessert and expresó.  While we had so enjoyed the croqueta degustación our last visit the new menu will tempt you even more.

Service was friendly, though erratic, it took a long time for food to arrive at times, even though we were the second or third table in the restaurant for lunch. The menu was interesting, we started with a mostly rare red tuna salad. The tuna had been slightly seared and was delicious, the salad was artfully and attractively prepared and was enough to feed two. Unfortunately both the wife and I found the dressing excessively acidic. We also had three tapas. The tosta de jamon was heaped with Iberico, on artisanal bread. Good. The vegetable tempera was vegetables cut and presented like french fries. Also good. The patatitas odds were stuffed potatoes, tasty and something different.

At first we faced some small troubles - it was Sunday before Farther's day, place was absolutelly full, running staff. Then, for some reason, they didn't want to give some salad or vegetales instead of potatoes for my family member. And first time in my life I mentioned my TripAdviser level. And it worked! Amazing! They really cares about TripAdvisor. Actually our waiters Marta and Carlos were pleasant and skilled persons, the whole problem was originated in the kitchen. So after this small misunderstanding the rest of the lunch was perfect. You should try Lubina al sal, Raviolis con Ibéricos, Risotto with artichokes and asparagus.

I had tacos (both meat and octopus) for a starter, and the meat was so try I almost choked myself - I don't know if they had attempted to slow-cook the meat, but it was dry as Sahara. As not this was enough, I found a small piece of plastic in one of the tacos, but it might have been one of the ingredients they use to compensate for the quality of the meat. For my main course I had the steak tartare, which was medium++. What was poor is that my dish was served in a fish bowl, while my friends who also ordered it got plates.

Nice location, lots of outdoor seating with a very much appreciated intermittent water mist. Staff had very little English and were happy to meet me half way with my limited Spanish :) The menu has good English translations. Generally great service. Drinks (soft and alcoholic) are on a par with Madrid prices and my strawberry Mojito was lovely, very strong and I loved the light bulb 'glass'! Funky touch.  If the food had been half the price this would be a five star rating. Very expensive for what you get - €11 for a few pieces of meat ravioli in a mushroom sauce, almost €10 for a dish of mixed veg from the plancha grill. Delicious, but not worth that much.

I would highly recommend that you make a reservation. An English menu is available. I would say the menu has a wide number of choices, but viewing you it I tended to notice the seafood choices. We ordered fried chicken wings; salmon tar tar, a kebab dish (served as a sandwich/wrap); hamburger and fries; squid and a sausage & arrachera dish. All the options were good. As a seafood lover I really enjoyed the squid- it was cooked perfectly with sauteed onions on top. The Salmon tar tar was also very good with a mix of mango and lemon. My daughter and her friend ate mostly the beef & sausage dish (it was good, but I would not order it again). The hamburger was rare and but tasty. Can't go wrong with the fried chicken wings- but it's really not anything different than what you can get from other restaurants- didn't stand out. Cod Fritters nice cooked and light. We received most of our small plates within 10 to 15 minutes, but then waited about 40 minutes for the other dishes. I think they were slammed by some larger parties in the back room. After bringing the wait to the attention of our server, food was promptly served. The bill came to about 70 Euros- not too bad (no liquor). I think they felt bad for the wait so 2 shots on the house (I didn't want one) for the girls I would return to La Pescaderia, but only with a reservation in the back of the room. The high top where we sat at the front was too loud with too many people passing by to enjoy a family dinner- but that's personal preference. It's a really good choice before or after shopping/strolling along the Gran Via.",2019-01-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d5598310-Reviews-or40-La_Pescaderia-Madrid.html,UID_36876,0.016,0.803,0.181,0.9961,0.172719298245614,0.5730701754385965,0.3505166666666667,1709,150,0.0877706260971328,0,55,False,73,0.1325301204819277,0.1325301204819277,0.2289156626506024,0.072289156626506,0.1686746987951807,0.036144578313253,0.0481927710843373,0.0481927710843373,0.0963855421686747,0.036144578313253,322,203,4.3105590062111805,0,0,dine friday night lucki get tabl top share anoth coupl would highli recommend make reserv english menu avail would say menu wide number choic view tend notic seafood choic order fri chicken wing salmon tar tar kebab dish serv sandwich wrap hamburg fri squid sausag arrachera dish option good seafood lover realli enjoy squid cook perfectli saute onion top salmon tar tar also good mix mango lemon daughter friend ate mostli beef sausag dish good would order hamburg rare tasti go wrong fri chicken wing realli anyth differ get restaur stand cod fritter nice cook light receiv small plate within minut wait minut dish think slam larger parti back room bring wait attent server food promptli serv bill came euro bad liquor think felt bad wait shot hous want one girl would return la pescaderia reserv back room high top sat front loud mani peopl pass enjoy famili dinner person prefer realli good choic shop stroll along gran via,good review,4

The place was a short walk from our apartment, and we went there wo/reservations. We came as they opened, but they only managed to fit us in to a small table up front...everything else was taken. And where we were, you couldn't get the Special Tasting Menu. But we were so impressed with the a la cart menu that we made reservations for the only day we'd be in Madrid and they'd be open. It was the best meal we had in Madrid, and we had some good ones. And the price was amazingly affordable, for the quality of food and service. The tasting menu included savory and sweet croquets, soups, seafood, even a Kobe beef slider with sliced mushrooms on a corn bread slice. Each dish is presented with care, and the staff will explain to you what goes into each (they have very good English skills). The place is deservedly popular, so reservations are a must.

Odds restaurant prides itself on catering to an extraordinary diner, with a variety of culinary treats to please a range of guests. They even offer specialty items for those sensitive to gluten.  Along with one of my dearest friends, I enjoyed a fabulous lunch in Salamanca at Odds Restaurant. The restaurant’s modern design drew us in immediately, as the fluidity of the curved chairs mixed with the straight angles of the square tables and bench seating heightened the contemporary feel. The restaurant also has a beautiful terrace right in the action of the city.  We took the server’s suggestion of sharing some appetizers, truly engaging in enjoying the gastronomic adventure together. We started with tuna belly and tomato tartare over guacamole with alfalfa sprouts and lime vinaigrette. Punchy and citrusy thanks to the tomato and lime flavor, this dish excited the taste buds. The sprouts added a nice crunch. We also opted for homemade croquettes, which are made every day and the fillings vary. The Foie Mi-cuit was delicious, cooked exactly as expected, and served with a sweet wine sauce on toasted bread. For my main, I chose stuffed meat ravioli with mushroom sauce, Parmesan cheese and truffle oil, which was earthy and balanced in flavor. My friend loved his grilled octopus with slowly cooked potatoes and red paprika oil, served on a stick. The octopus was expertly grilled, and the potatoes had a soft, creamy texture. The braised veal cheek stew over mashed potato cream seasoned with truffles was a major hit as well, a truly unique dish.  Not able to forgo dessert, we opted for a red velvet cupcake with violet ice cream, and fritters stuffed with chocolate and banana, served with wild red fruit sauce. Indulgent, sweet, decadent.

We chose to sit outside as the area was heated and it was not too cold. There was quite a lot of choice on the menu. We had tempura prawns to start, which were expensive but nice and the portion size okay. For main we opted for the t-bone steak for two which came with chips and padron peppers. We asked for it to be cooked medium. When it arrived it was a huge portion of meat, it was more medium rare than medium but was very tasty and tender and so we barely made any impact on the chips and would have preferred to have more padron peppers. My husband who loves steak was unable to finish it but we enjoyed it and at €30 was a very reasonable price for steak for 2.

They opened a little before their scheduled opening at 9pm, we were the first to sit down and by 9:15pm all of the tables were full! I'm glad we showed up a bit early since we had not made a reservation, but they very graciously accommodated us anyway. There was one staff member who spoke English very well and the rest spoke a little so we were able to attempt a bit of our Spanish and were well taken care of. I tried brushing off a bit of my high school Spanish to get through the menu, and everything seemed quite interesting.  We opted for the Chef's 6 course tasting menu for €18 per person. I was a little nervous at first (since I hate giving up control) that the Chef would decide to send us stuff that I wouldn't like! I didn't need to worry at all (although I really had no idea what I was eating) everything was OUTSTANDING! We started with an Aperitivo (some sort of vegetable), then we had a classic tapas dish (Russian salad). Next we received a large croqueta with a tray of thinly sliced onion, chopped tomato and minced pickled jalapeños- all served with a small basket of nacho chips. We were told to cut the croqueta open (filled with gooey melted cheese - YUM!) and add as much of the fixins as one wanted then close it up and use the chips to dip into the concoction. Then we were given 2 types of croquetas to try - I think one was chicken and the other was potato and cheese (not sure though!)- but DELICIOUS nonetheless. Lastly we were offered mini street tacos that were smoky and very flavorful! After such a delectable dinner, we decided to splurge and order some dessert. We opted for their Sorbete de Mojito. It seemed self explanatory- Mojito Sorbet.....right? Wrong! It turned out that would have been too boring for such an inventive and eclectic restaurant. When the dessert arrived it was in a small individual sized milk bottle with a straw sticking out the top. It turns out they had made it into a very minty (at least 5 full mint leaves inside!) and refreshing, thick shake!  All in all we had a wonderful dinner, and if time allows, would love to come back for another meal before we leave Madrid. A real treat for the palate! The staff were very welcoming and attentive, although they were very busy (since the place was packed!) and worked with us and our poor grasp of Spanish.",2016-10-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2311131-Reviews-or30-La_Gastro_de_Chema-Madrid.html,UID_36925,0.064,0.806,0.13,0.9915,0.0719982512779122,0.4788646758138283,0.4875653846153846,2400,209,0.0870833333333333,11,68,False,97,0.106060606060606,0.0606060606060606,0.3181818181818182,0.0454545454545454,0.0909090909090909,0.0303030303030303,0.0303030303030303,0.0757575757575757,0.1666666666666666,0.0757575757575757,443,268,4.415349887133183,0,0,decid check gastro croqueteria de chema last night late dinner open littl schedul open pm first sit pm tabl full glad show bit earli sinc made reserv gracious accommod us anyway one staff member spoke english well rest spoke littl abl attempt bit spanish well taken care tri brush bit high school spanish get menu everyth seem quit interest opt chef cours tast menu per person littl nervou first sinc hate give control chef would decid send us stuff like need worri although realli idea eat everyth outstand start aperitivo sort veget classic tapa dish russian salad next receiv larg croqueta tray thinli slice onion chop tomato minc pickl jalap os serv small basket nacho chip told cut croqueta open fill gooey melt chees yum add much fixin one want close use chip dip concoct given type croqueta tri think one chicken potato chees sure though delici nonetheless lastli offer mini street taco smoki flavor delect dinner decid splurg order dessert opt sorbet de mojito seem self explanatori mojito sorbet right wrong turn would bore invent eclect restaur dessert arriv small individu size milk bottl straw stick top turn made minti least full mint leav insid refresh thick shake wonder dinner time allow would love come back anoth meal leav madrid real treat palat staff welcom attent although busi sinc place pack work us poor grasp spanish,good review,4

Although it was quite early for Spanish standards (21.00) there were only a few tables available and the maitre sat us down on the terrace.  We couldn't have made a better choice. We ordered various plates. The ox tail hamburger was amazing, lemon chicken, tomato tartar with tuna also and the lime pie and pineapple mojito were the icing on the cake.

Anyways, we got to the Gastro pub and he told us he had no tables, but hang out and have some wine and he would take care of us - and he did. A spot opened up at the counter and he saved it for us and got us there.  I had no idea what to order, so he helped me order by what I like, sweet, sour, what kind of meat, etc. I could not have been happier with the service, selection, or croquettes.  Go hungry, and order a lot! And get dessert! And then get more dessert!

The table was not quite ready upon arrival but that was not a problem. We eventually sat down but then it took some time for the menus to arrive and especially the wine list so that we could order drinks.  There didn't seem to be one person in charge of our table and the order taking was very haphazard.  The food when it came was excellent but one of our starte dishes was the cheese fondue which arrived unaccompanied so with nothing to dip it with or eat it with. Bread had not been served at the table (very unusual in Spain) so we asked that this be served - after some 10 minutes we were told that it was being made - so a long delay whilst we waited for the bread - probably 25 minutes later the bread arrived and we got on with the fabulous fondue. Main course was subsequently served but the meat dishes with their juices were served on flat slates - big mistake- since when serving the juices dripped onto the guests !!! Surely they should know better! Then to cap it all at the end of the meal and deserts etc some guests ordered some drinks (g&t etc) which were served at 0100 - 5 minutes later we were told that we could no longer stay on the terrace but had to go indoors since they did not have a permit for people to sit on the terrace after 0100 - so why didn't they serve the drinks indoors and invite us inside for the drinks.  A Big Disappointment for all and quite obvious that there are problems with their service levels especially when serving on the terrace.,2016-10-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8776812-Reviews-or10-Teckel_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_36960,0.057,0.867,0.076,0.8045,0.0835903250188964,0.5054610733182161,0.42821,1549,152,0.0981278244028405,4,28,False,67,0.2352941176470588,0.088235294117647,0.1470588235294117,0.0294117647058823,0.1764705882352941,0.0294117647058823,0.0294117647058823,0.0588235294117647,0.1176470588235294,0.088235294117647,300,160,4.156666666666666,0,0,book larg parti arriv time pm tabl quit readi upon arriv problem eventu sat took time menu arriv especi wine list could order drink seem one person charg tabl order take haphazard food came excel one start dish chees fondu arriv unaccompani noth dip eat bread serv tabl unusu spain ask serv minut told made long delay whilst wait bread probabl minut later bread arriv got fabul fondu main cours subsequ serv meat dish juic serv flat slate big mistak sinc serv juic drip onto guest sure know better cap end meal desert etc guest order drink g etc serv minut later told could longer stay terrac go indoor sinc permit peopl sit terrac serv drink indoor invit us insid drink big disappoint quit obviou problem servic level especi serv terrac,bad review,2

Pescaderia (literally ""fish market"", although it also serves meats) is one of those. You can book through the website, or give them a call. You can also eat at the bar without a booking. It gets fantastically busy during the weekend, so it pays to do your homework beforehand and reserve a table. Together with my group of friends, we decided to honour the name of the restaurant and order predominantly fish dishes. In true Spanish tapas tradition we were also going to share everything, which I believe to be the correct thing to do at this restaurant, even if the menu is divided into appetisers to share and main courses. The langostinos salteados (sautéed prawns), with avocado and mango, stood out from everything else and were truly delicious; the chipirones frescos encebollados (grilled calamari with onions) came a close second; and the carpaccio de pulpo (octopus carpaccio) in an oil vinegrette was truly paper thin - a welcome change from the omnipresent pulpo a la gallega you find at most tapas restaurants and that I am not so keen on. I also need to mention the ceviche and the Greek salad - both of which were very tasty. The portions are not that small and after all of this the three of us were full.  Drinks deserve their own separate chapter in this review: both the original pisco sour (Peru's best known alcoholic export), and its maracuja declination were delicious. If its not food that you are after, you might want to go in just to experience those two delicious drinks. I will be back to check the rest of the range. The service was spotless: fast and pleasant. Food was brought almost instantly, empty glasses and plates were whisked away in a millisecond, and cutlery changed in between courses. Considering the restaurant was bursting with people, this is nothing short of operational excellence.  For such a small and unassuming restaurant from the outside, the place features design interiors and a very nice bar. The Malasana buzz will conquer you. For this quality, the price is absolutely reasonable - we paid Euro 30 each, including drinks.

The restaurant is decorated in a trendy and cozy way. The most fascinating thing is the great variety and combination of croquettes that they have, I would like to have tasted all of them without any doubt. Regarding to the other dishes they have I will say they are delicious. Maybe the size of the portion was not so big, but correct in order to taste the delicious mixtures. We were six and all of us were fascinated about the quality of the food. We decided to share the portions, so we could taste more dishes, just some bites. I would like to notice the ""fideua con costra"", more than you can ever expect. Also the lamb with potatoes or the shabu shabu of balck cod. As desserts we ordered all the sweet croquettes, which were very tasty and surprising, my favourite was the oreo croquette.

The restaurant owners are a couple: man being the chef and the girl the waitress . The place is small but cosy, only 10 tables or so. We tried the tasting menu which consisted of a few dishes which had won some award at some food competition.  The girl was very patient to explain everything in English.  The tomato soup was refreshing with a little quail egg and the presentation was nice. Next we had the creamiest foie gas pâté we had ever tasted with a nice combination with some special Spanish Christmas cookies. That was unexpectedly good. Next we had a piece of thin ham with salmon roe and some herbs on top which we needed to make it into a roll with food tweezers. The grilled lamb was marvelous with it being cooked just right and succelent . The dessert was special flavour ice cream with rice.  There was only the girl taking orders, presenting the dishes and taking away the dishes, making coffee and settling bills. We were amazed at how she did all these at ease. Te chef had actually won a 2014 best chef award somewhere . We didn't really go because he had won a prize, but certainly we felt that the food was made and served with passion.

This was a little gem with plenty of exciting variations on this classic Spanish tapas staple snack. The setting was small and intimate, with arched white ceilings and eclectic fixtures. They did not have an English menu but the wonderfully friendly waitress offered to to translate as best she could. However we plumped for the menu of the day, which consisted of 6 tapas dishes of the chef's choice. All were mouth wateringly good, a diverse range and served freshly cooked. As the dishes were delivered from kitchen to the tables around the restaurant, I could see diners cooing and leaning over to look at the gorgeously presented morsels (myself included).

We were having our cañas and having fun at the crowded bar when suddenly the waiter came out of nowhere and said: ""speak in a lower tone because you're not the only ones here"". We were laughing as anyone else, even the group next to us looked weird at him too, we were at a bar in Malasaña the most outgoing neighborhood, not in a quiet restaurant, so if we can't laugh there, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who likes to laugh (?). On top of that I suspect that if we were speaking in Spanish this wouldn't have happened. Obviously it ruined the mood and we left the bar immediately never to come back again and the group next to us even said that we were doing the right thing.

The food, the staff and the ambience were 1st class. However, we visited again today 2/4 at 1700 for a drink and a snack, again the food was lovely (we had the cod fritters and potato bravas) but our experience was rather spoiled by the attitude of one of the bar staff, I believe she is called Maria. We were sitting at a table inside the door by the cigarette machine and Maria was busy feeding an envelope of coins into the machine which was very annoying and when she was asked to serve us she walked away, another member of staff took our order for a glass of white wine which was then delivered by Maria, she poured the wine from a nearly empty bottle but stopped pouring when there was a tiny amount left, she refused to pour this into the glass and when we jokingly said something about pouring it in she shrugged and left. I’m pretty sure that the small amount left was going to be discarded and I felt she was “punishing” us for interrupting her mission to use the cigarette machine to change up her envelope of small coins. Perhaps Maria needs a little lesson on customer service! We decided not to let this experience deter us from visiting again the next evening and we were not disappointed, once gain the service and food were amazing and I would highly recommend trying the restaurant.

It consisted of 2 starters - one of which was scallop carpaccio with a caviar vinaigrette, I can't even talk about it without my mouth watering - 6 main courses, and 2 desserts, and it cost less than 40 euros. Because we are ridiculous people, we also ordered two croquetas - one with blue cheese and the other I can't recall at the moment. They were delicious, as well, but not as special as the special menu items. The desserts we had were very savory (beet and goat cheese souffle kind of thing), but that may be because I am allergic to cocoa and apples, two obvious dessert ingredients (by the way, they were very accommodating for my allergies - asked right at the beginning). We nearly went back the next night, but decided to go watch a football match instead (Madrid vs. Atletico - could not miss!). The only ""critique"" I would make is that service is VERY fast. On the one hand, you have 10 courses, so it still takes a long time to eat (I think we were there for 2.5 hours), but on the other hand, I would have preferred about 5 minutes between dishes to reflect on how fantastic they were. We mentioned it to the server (who was wonderful), and he said that was the style in Madrid - apparently Madrilenos like to have have their food right away.  Fantastic!

Honestly, I would have never walked in had I been alone: I live in Madrid and would have stayed far from a small corner bar with large posters and banners advertising cheap chocolate products.  With photos. However, trusting the guide, we all heaped in (the place isn't very big) and waited for what is basically the best hot chocolate I've ever eaten in Madrid. And I've been here a year and a half. Rich, thick, not sweetened. The porras (which we had instead of churros) made to order: hot, crunchy and delicious. The staff was friendly and spoke quite a good English.  On the whole, a pretty good experience. I will probably send friends and family to this place instead of the less-friendly albeit more famous San Gines. ;) Good job!",2014-09-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1788549-Reviews-or260-Chocolat-Madrid.html,UID_10062,0.012,0.74,0.248,0.9905,0.3223593073593073,0.6220095238095238,0.33499,806,61,0.075682382133995,1,30,False,30,0.1578947368421052,0.1842105263157894,0.2631578947368421,0.0789473684210526,0.1842105263157894,0.0526315789473684,0.0,0.0,0.0789473684210526,0.0,143,104,4.629370629370629,0,0,came madrid food tour pleasantli surpris honestli would never walk alon live madrid would stay far small corner bar larg poster banner advertis cheap chocol product photo howev trust guid heap place big wait basic best hot chocol ever eaten madrid year half rich thick sweeten porra instead churro made order hot crunchi delici staff friendli spoke quit good english whole pretti good experi probabl send friend famili place instead less friendli albeit famou san gine good job,good review,4

Service was prompt and both of our attentive and helpful waitresses understood English. A Maitre'd also hovered and kept a close eye on proceedings ensuring a good standard of service. Steaks are reasonably priced between €18 and €24, with choices including Ribeye, Sirloin and thin skirt varieties (the Ribeye is particularly good), but more than steak is on offer and they also have a tapas menu that is very keenly priced. We decided not to order a starter but two cups of gazpacho arrived with toasted bread and a cream cheese dip mixed with chives and orange which was thoughtful, tasty and free. French fries may seem expensive at €6 but the portion serves two. Feeling sated after an excellent meal we were given a glass of mango juice on the house and then, having decided to forego dessert, two glasses of fruit compote topped with cream arrived followed by two shot glasses accompanied by a generous portion of limoncello.

Location is perfect, if you get a table outside, there are some plants that kind of insulate you from the crowds, which can get lively and raucous. (there were a couple of dozen teenage kids in the square and some sort of scuffle, maybe a lovers quarrel that brought the local Policia - nothing very violent though). If you are allergic to cigarette smoke, get a table inside as patrons who sit outside will smoke, and on hot days they will be running the mist machine and it kinda gets into your food. We ordered one each of the sirloin, rib-eye and skirt steak. They're all grilled to your proper temperature and all of them are good quality beef (although not Lugers or Homestead steakhouse level). They ask you to order sides and each one, like the fries and backed potato are each one large enough for 3-4 people, so you don't need more than 1 or 2 for a party of 3-6.  We ordered wine but once again got served some free mango cocktail when we ordered dessert - the Flan was excellent. Additionally, we were given a yougurt-blueberry cup which was delicious, again gratis.

My wife, a vegan, and I had eaten there several times in the past and had always been very satisfied, so we had been looking forward to going there again. We were made welcome by the courteous waiter and received the customary small but excellent starter dishes and a glass of sparkling wine. We then ordered our food, and explained that my wife does not eat anything from an animal, i.e. no meat, no fish, no eggs, no cheese etc. The staff assured us that the pasta dish would meet these requirements. When the pasta arrived (after a delicious salad starter) we found that it was topped with three rather long pieces of cheese, which we removed immediately. But it was then found that the dish contained large quantities of egg in the sauce. We called the waiter, who took the dish away. Several minutes later the manager arrived and asked for an explanation. He started to argue, so I walked out of the restaurant and asked him to join me there so that other customers would not be inconvenienced. He argued that Italian pasta contains egg (we were in Spain, not Italy) and ignored the issue of the cheese. I told him we would not pay for the dish and returned to the table. Several minutes later he came back with a revised bill. But he started shouting at my wife (not me) and was VERY rude to her. Everybody in the restaurant heard what he said, and I apologised to the guests at the neighbouring tables. The man is the rudest person we have ever met in any restaurant in the world. His staff got the order wrong but he was not willing to accept responsibility. The inedible dish cost €15, so the restaurant has lost virtually nothing except its reputation. This was a truly terrible and disgusting experience, especially after such good meals in the past. If you go there and do not like a dish, think before you complain, unless you want to be insulted by an ignorant male chauvinist.",2015-09-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4690521-Reviews-or110-De_Maria_Opera-Madrid.html,UID_37043,0.118,0.768,0.114,-0.8296,0.0580102040816326,0.5190561224489796,0.32204,2022,184,0.0909990108803165,0,47,False,76,0.0735294117647058,0.1323529411764706,0.2647058823529412,0.0294117647058823,0.1323529411764706,0.0735294117647058,0.0588235294117647,0.0441176470588235,0.1323529411764706,0.0588235294117647,364,219,4.5576923076923075,0,0,intend honest balanc construct assess experi restaur mid septemb wife vegan eaten sever time past alway satisfi look forward go made welcom courteou waiter receiv customari small excel starter dish glass sparkl wine order food explain wife eat anyth anim e meat fish egg chees etc staff assur us pasta dish would meet requir pasta arriv delici salad starter found top three rather long piec chees remov immedi found dish contain larg quantiti egg sauc call waiter took dish away sever minut later manag arriv ask explan start argu walk restaur ask join custom would inconvenienc argu italian pasta contain egg spain itali ignor issu chees told would pay dish return tabl sever minut later came back revis bill start shout wife rude everybodi restaur heard said apologis guest neighbour tabl man rudest person ever met restaur world staff got order wrong will accept respons ined dish cost restaur lost virtual noth except reput truli terribl disgust experi especi good meal past go like dish think complain unless want insult ignor male chauvinist,bad review,2

The outdoor area was great, the heaters we well positioned so we weren't cooking and each chair had a blanket!  The complimentary champagne, bread and cheese spread was a nice little suprise and delicious!  The staff were quick, friendly and efficient.  We ordered the pesto pasta and asado. Honestly, the asado was amazing, perfectly cooked and the chimmichurri was spot on. The pesto was delicious and a good size serving.  Just when we thought we had enough, the waiter brings out a complimentary limoncello? And mango/yogurt mini dessert. Both, delicious and a perfect way to end our dinner.  But no, out come the complimentary after dinner liquors, which my husband enjoyed several of as they leave them at the table.  Well priced, not budget but moderate. They had indoor and outdoor seating. The staff is friendly and they understand English. It's in a great spot, there's plenty of shops around if you feel like going for a walk after the dinner.

With an outside dining area bordering the square and a good sized inside serving space, this restaurant oozes ambience, and is well patronised by locals and visitors alike. The menu is varied (the lemon chicken particularly good) with some dishes prepared on the open grill. Service is prompt, polite and helpful, the wine list wide, varied and well priced. The restaurant is tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean and free from the annoying background music which seems to be omnipresent at most other eateries! Particularly appreciated was the glass (free) of Cava, the free appetiser and the free liqueur at the end of the meal! Two courses (a la carte) for two people, with a bottle of good wine and coffee, all for 70Euro - outstanding value for quality food and atmosphere.

It looked presentable from the outside and there were several people seated at the outdoor tables which is usually a good sign. Sadly my experience didn't measure up to my expectations. I sat at a table on the street waiting for the server to approach me but the minutes ticked by and he seemed to forget about me. I attempted to make eye contact several times even waving my hand to get his attention but nothing worked. A woman standing on the street watching noticed my attempts and finally said something to him and he finally came over. I ordered the special menu del dia. Usually with these types of specials you have a choice of the primero and possibly a choice of segundo. There was only a choice for the primero. I asked for recommendations and based on his information I told him which items I wanted and asked for a glass of wine. My primero was brought to me within 5-10 minutes. I ordered the Caldo de Reina which is a soup. What I received was a broth with a soft egg floating in it....not terribly impressive. I finished the soup and sat for about 15 minutes before my segundo was brought. This was a baked fish. As the waitress delivering the dish to me placed the plate down in front of me I asked her where my wine was? She looked surprised and I immediately attempted to make eye contact with the main waiter and asked him where my wine was...oops he forgot! I started eating while waiting for my wine to arrive. The fish was over cooked and dry and full of many tiny bones. I kept having to remove these from my mouth every mouthful which I found annoying. The bread served was dry and somewhat stale and there was no sauce to moisten it with or oil offered. Up finishing, I again sat for about 20 min without anyone coming to take away my plate which was now attracting wasps flying around it. I had to wave again to get the waiters attention and get him to come over and remove the dishes. I was also surprised that no water was offered or brought to me. I knew there was a postre with the special so I looked on the menu while sitting to see what the choices were so I could order as soon as he arrived. When I told him which one I wanted he told me that one was not with the special...so I had to choose from the ones he was telling me. I took the tiramiso which actually was probably the best thing and I doubt it was made in house!

On walking in we were welcomed by the manager and our waiter. Directed to a table on the terrace(as there is a 10% service charge, fly I know) Chairs pulled out for us. As soon as we sat down they put on another heat lamp aiming at us. Our order was taken after some free cava was poured. You will hear ""on the house"" a lot here and it is all free! Who doesn't like free stuff?! We then had a couple of started dishes brought out to us on the house. Including a shot like glass of soup nice touch in February. Food was excellent! No faults! Only thing I would say is some dishes are over priced, example is a plain plate of chips was around 6€. Steaks were 18-24 which is good for steaks. They only had sirloin cut, which is not my favourite. If you are british o highly reccomend the black pudding starter! After our meal we were give an a small apéritif of sambuca. My partner loved it but I cant touch the stuff. Also a free strawberry compote desert. Service is very attentive also. For prices sake we had a starter and main each, a side of chips and a wine it came to around 55€ Which is good value for the quality of food and service. Extra props to the manager as the restaurant is located in a plaza which can be popular with homeless. A couple tried to come in and ask for money at the table but the manager swiftly and politely escorts them out. It is a shame but not pleasant when your trying to enjoy an evening out. All you need to say to them is ""no hablo espanol"" it means I don't speak Spanish and you will be left alone!

We came across this place which seemed lovely and not too expensive compared to others we had looked at. We chose a table outside which despite being February, was surprisingly not cold at all! We were given menus quickly and the waiter made every effort to speak English for us as we don't speak Spanish.  The menu is varied with some of the dishes being a little overpriced in our opinion. Prior to receiving anything we ordered, we were treated to a small glass of Rose (sparkling wine), 2 little glasses of vegetable soup, cream cheese with toasted bread slices and baguette slices with tomato, tuna & peppers. All of this was on the house which was a lovely extra! My partner opted for the Black Pudding starter which he said was very different from the Black Pudding we have at home (Scotland) but was very tasty. I had the Ham and Mozzerella pie which was a little like an empanada, and was very nice. For our main courses, my partner had the ribs which he said were lovely and I had the Spaghetti Bolognese which was great. Again, after dinner we were brought a glass of mango smoothie and a raspberry compot each on the house. The meal was finished with a complimentary Apéritif which was such a nice touch. My only grumble is that there appeared to be a large gathering of homeless people outside the restaurant, which wouldn't bother us however they started to come into the restaurant and ask for money. They were quickly escorted out by management however.  I'd definitely recommend this restaurant as it was lovely however some dishes are overpriced for what they are.

We quickly ordered our food and immediately we were being treated almost like royalty. Absolutely delicious pre-starters were served, the tapas, the food and the wines were all excellent and reasonably priced - even the vegetarian truffle risotto was juicy and tasty. If you like a fruity, well-balanced and rounded white wine with no acidity try the ""Vinas de Anna"" - excellent (comes in a fancy white bottle), and the TORO red wine wasn't bad either - rather good actually.. Service was promt and efficient with no annoying waiting time for the food. We were too full to have an after dinner sweet, but as we ordered coffee the co-waiter served a lovely panacotta and an absolutely fresh and mouthwatering mango smoothie. As we were about to go we were introduced to a nice, ice cold ""limoncella"" - maybe a trifle too sweet for some, but a nice finish to an excellent and lavish dinner. We will definitely come back to this place next time we are in Madrid and will recommend this restaurant to friends and family - and everybody else.

But last night (night 3 of a 3-night stay In Madrid) we took a short walk from our hotel near Teatro Real and found this restaurant. Unbelievably - 12 December - we could sit outside on the terrace. We were greeted with an on-the-house glass of cava roused (that is a first). Our meal was simple - excellent char-grilled sirloin (probably some of the best beef we have ever tasted) with a heap of mixed leaf and pine kernel salad, a bottle of the only ""Madrid"" red wine on the list (oomphy and fruity) and a shared dessert of home-made pedro ximenez ice cream. Bliss. But that wasn't all. On-the-house dessert tapas - a little mango smoothie and blueberries on sweet cream cheese and carafes (yes plural) of limoncello. Great service. Great food. Great location (view currently of the Christmas market and the back of Teatro Real). I could go on. But my enthusiasm must already be apparent.

Luckily Google maps had this little spot listed. We had already fallen into the tourist trap tapas bars and wanted something that Madrileños would visit. This lovely place delivered BIG. We were greeted by a busy manager, who found us a table even with such a booming crowd. Beautiful red wine by the glass and ice cold cervesa for the adults and Coca Cola for the kids. The girls had fresh herby greek salad and the tav ble shared the tuna with tomato salad. We also had cod fritters with a wonderful sauce. We were given a basket of crusty bread to savor all of the sauces and dressings with. Cheesecake all around after was a wonderful treat. It was light and not too sweet but drizzled with a wonderful raspberry sauce.

A huge array of different gastronomic experiences with an amazing outside roof terrace (smoking allowed). My favourite was the lovely wine and cheese merchants by the doors to the terrace. Very reasonable and very palatable glasses of wine, each served with a bowl of olives, cheese or jamon. Such a lovely experience we went back the following day. They also serve some gourmet snacks, tapas and oysters.  Other choices on the floor range from burgers to Mexican to ice cream to cakes.

There was not the range of restaurants or cafes we were expecting according to other reviews, but the few that were there were typical Mexican, Burger, Pizza, tapas places using the rooftop view to charge over the odds compared to its street couterparts, as does the Central Bar. One Cana, and one Doble Beer 7.50 euro. At least double any street or tapas bar.It's not as if its a relaxing experience either.

There are those who will say El Corte Ingles is just a department store -- and of course, it is. But they have some clever ""extras"" (take your passport & get a 10% off voucher for the day!) After you've wandered around for a bit, head to the 9th floor where the Gourmet Experience offers a cluster of eatery options from pintxos (small plates) to pasta to sushi to burgers to freshly shaved jamon iberico, to pastries, etc (all ""gourmet"" of course.) The pintxos I got were excellent: fresh, tasty, imaginative. A local Madrileno businessman sitting at the counter recommended his favorite wine to go with the seafood pintxos I picked - all I can say is I wish I'd written it down! The Gourmet Experience is also a great place to pick up presents for your favorite ""foodie"" back home (especially if this is your last stop and you're running out of time), but the best thing about it (for me) were the fantastic views from the wrap-around deck. The food and drink are NOT cheap (nor expensive - just don't think ""food court"" or ""snack bar"" -- these are far better and nicer than that!).  You'll find better deals in lots of places around Madrid. But like most big cities, some places offer more than just food -- and you pay for ""experience"" as much as the food/drink. The Gourmet Experience at El Corte Ingles is a fun stop -- and convenient to many of the places you'll probably be visiting in Madrid. In fact, if one of you wants to shop and the other needs a glass of wine -- this may be the best choice in town.",2013-06-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4054213-Reviews-or150-Gourmet_Experience_Gran_Via-Madrid.html,UID_37171,0.019,0.802,0.179,0.9967,0.2926215277777777,0.4973090277777777,0.2968454545454545,1733,149,0.0859780727062896,3,74,False,72,0.119047619047619,0.1904761904761904,0.3809523809523809,0.0,0.2142857142857142,0.0238095238095238,0.0,0.0238095238095238,0.0476190476190476,0.0,323,196,4.365325077399381,0,0,everyon probabl end point one mani el cort ingl locat around spain go go one madrid would make one gourmet experi th floor say el cort ingl depart store cours clever extra take passport get voucher day wander around bit head th floor gourmet experi offer cluster eateri option pintxo small plate pasta sushi burger freshli shave jamon iberico pastri etc gourmet cours pintxo got excel fresh tasti imagin local madrileno businessman sit counter recommend favorit wine go seafood pintxo pick say wish written gourmet experi also great place pick present favorit foodi back home especi last stop run time best thing fantast view wrap around deck food drink cheap expens think food court snack bar far better nicer find better deal lot place around madrid like big citi place offer food pay experi much food drink gourmet experi el cort ingl fun stop conveni mani place probabl visit madrid fact one want shop need glass wine may best choic town,good review,4

The owner mixes and fries the churros on the spot and they are crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, with a slight saltiness. The dipping chocolate is smooth, of the right consistency, and not too sweet. It was more than enough for us to have one cup of chocolate, an order of smaller churros and larger porras. Often when we have dessert, we find our mouths have an aftertaste of sugar. Not so here. The desserts are perfectly sweetened, so even though we ate churros and porras with chocolate, a frappe and a complimentary cookie afterwards--more sweets than we normally would have--we felt good afterwards. The owner and assistant were quite affable and friendly, and the place was filled with Madrid locals having a family celebration.

This is the worst service and food I have ever received. I'm actually sitting in the restaurant now typing this as I'm so angry. We arrived at 2pm, and ordered starters which arrived 20 mins later. No problems there. Then we waited 45 further minutes for the second course to arrive. Despite asking several times, we got told by the waitress ""look it's not my fault"". Great service. Then three of the four meals arrived. However the waitress had no idea what the different types of burgers were. To make matters worse, one of the burgers was meant to be ""well done"", I can only describe it as ""having a heartbeat"". Naturally, it was sent back. 20 minutes later we were still two burgers down, then they arrived. Sadly the burger we sent back was still completely raw when it returned. So poor.

The people were nice, the vibe was cool and fun. We went there twice and would actually rate this 4 stars. Two things made this a three though. The first was that the sangria we ordered was watered down and was, to say the least, average. Nonetheless, it was late at night when we arrived so we ordered our food since we were really hungry and drank. Then comes the second thing. It was last call for food orders as the kitchen was closing. Hate to say anything negative about the place but the kitchen was being cleaned with gloved hands, which was great, but the same gloved hands were used to handle the last food orders. Soap and clean, handle food, then soaped and cleaned again. From our vantage point we just looked in disbelief.

Once ordered, they never once poured the wine for us. The tapas were mediocre, salad was pedestrian, and the steaks (my husband and daughter ordered two different ones) and lamb were terrible (all of the meat was grisly, fatty, and nearly inedible). One steak came with the green peppers commonly served at tapas restaurants; we never tasted poor peppers until we went to Mercado de la Reina--they were cold and limp.

We fell in love with the place the first time we visited. The food was good and the service was great, the place was spotless, including the bathroom area. As some reviewers have mentioned, the 'porros' are very greasy and I avoided them. The chocolate con churros was delicious and was very good compared with others I had tried in other cities in Spain. Upon my return to Madrid this year, I headed back to Chocolat and had breakfast there most days. It was a nice and relaxing start to the day to have a good coffee, a bite to eat, good service and a friendly atmosphere while getting on the Wifi to plan my day or catch up on emails. It is a small cafe and gets busy with locals and visitors. Be sure to have a glass of the fresh orange juice. I tried a few different things on the menu and all were good. I didn't have any complaints about the food. The prices were very reasonable and the offer of a free sweet after the meal was a nice touch. Location is good too, very near the Prado and about a 15 minute walk to the Atoche train station and Reina Sofia Museum.

Located on the 9th floor, this chic marketplace offers a wide array of gourmet delicacies and eateries where one can sample a broad range of cuisines: artisan breads, Dim Sum, razor clams, hamburgers, Macarons, and gelati.

Throughout this space one finds tables and booths, some with wonderful windows with view of Madrid. The outside terrace, when the weather cooperates, offers a nice intimate place to view the city, especially the iconic Schweppes Building with its distinctive signage. Night is the best time to enjoy the illuminated sign. And a great place for people watching too. I found it somewhat pushy, jumpy, and very crowded to really enjoy.

BUT, take care in coming with time because the tables near the window are little. Anyway, all around the space are a lot of spots where you can sit and enjoy food from different places. There is a mexican place where the music is kind of loud, during the weeking more, but if you don't want noise you just don't seat in that square. Is not cheap, but is affordable, and a must go even if you are a resident. There is a terrace, but views there are not that good as inside. Also, you have a GOURMET selection with food separated from a lot of different countries. If you are a foreigner, I recommend you to take a look and then go down to the supermarket in the same building to compare prizes, as here, in gourmet experience, the shop is kind of expensive. On the other hand you can find things more nice for a present or more strange. It reminds me to the top floor of the shopping centre of brands placed in Milan, called ''La renaissenza'' or something similar, where you can also see the Duomo.",2015-10-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4054213-Reviews-or110-Gourmet_Experience_Gran_Via-Madrid.html,UID_37350,0.029,0.85,0.121,0.9741,0.1825810185185185,0.5016203703703704,0.3350111111111111,1148,121,0.1054006968641114,0,33,False,43,0.1636363636363636,0.1818181818181818,0.2727272727272727,0.0727272727272727,0.2181818181818181,0.0,0.0,0.0181818181818181,0.0545454545454545,0.0181818181818181,221,131,4.199095022624435,0,0,place well locat hang around town lift top shop centr th floor get view madrid take care come time tabl near window littl anyway around space lot spot sit enjoy food differ place mexican place music kind loud week want nois seat squar cheap afford must go even resid terrac view good insid also gourmet select food separ lot differ countri foreign recommend take look go supermarket build compar prize gourmet experi shop kind expens hand find thing nice present strang remind top floor shop centr brand place milan call la renaissenza someth similar also see duomo,good review,4

The views from the terrace are worth seeing, it was unusually quite cloudy during our visit though. The prices here are well above average but you do get good quality food, a great view, and the atmosphere is buzzing.",2015-03-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4054213-Reviews-or120-Gourmet_Experience_Gran_Via-Madrid.html,UID_37358,0.0,0.754,0.246,0.9906,0.3225490196078431,0.573921568627451,0.48379,797,57,0.0715181932245922,0,20,False,37,0.1071428571428571,0.1785714285714285,0.3214285714285714,0.0714285714285714,0.1785714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071428571428571,0.0357142857142857,143,112,4.580419580419581,0,0,tri food outlet food hall th floor el cort ingl madrid oyster bar fresh tasti oyster laurent perrier champagn crisp dri tast compliment perfectli excel servic well gourmet burger bar start get busi wait burger made succul flavoursom beef serv medium rare request one better burger macaroon coffe shop pistachio macaroon fill divin ice cream amaz highli recommend view terrac worth see unusu quit cloudi visit though price well averag get good qualiti food great view atmospher buzz,good review,4

No agar agar, gellification, spherization (not sure this is a word), nitrogen shots or any cookoo techniques being deployed by Adria and friends but clean techniques with good products and a wine pairing you have never experienced before. These guys have an ideal team, know their business, listen to their customers, serve them like kings and remain affordable. Off course, do not expect tapas for one euro, meals for 10 eur. you are a foodie, not a simple backpack tourist. You expect to be delighted, I can assure you, you will. Grilled octopus on a creamy risotto, bull's tail (the real tail) with truffel puree amongst others. Wines from Tenerife and the unappreciated bodegas resalte to complete the picture.

To accompany our drinks, we were given a bowl of olives which we demolished in record quick time. Bizarrely, to us at least, they had slices of carrot in the marinade but you will just have to check them out for yourselves to find out how good they are. So delicious! Later, we were given some crackers filled with Russian salad. Not some sloppy mayo with bits of cold vegetable in - but a substantial potato salad (ok, yes, probably with bits of cold vegetable) full of flavour. Again, absolutely delicious. We met up in this bar again after visiting The Prado on our last day, initially just for a drink. Checking our watches to make sure we could still be back at the hotel in time for the taxi to the airport, we ended up ordering from the menu and eating in the small dining area at the rear of the bar.

Usually this place is overcrowded - especially in the afternoons and in the evenings when the locals are used to drop in to meet friends and have a drink and some tapas. Some experienced tourists appear there too to take an advantage of the top floor location and to take a view of Madrid from the balcony. There is a shop with top quality Spanish gourmet products but also a variety of bars offering different food and drinks.

Do not expect to have any privacy in your lunch/dinner as it is impossible not to hear everything the people are discussing around you: there are long tables were everyone sits elbow to elbow or individual tables for 2/4 people with 2cms distance between each other. Another point is that the place is quite expensive for what you get! I shared 4 tapas/raciones plus a couple of glassses of wine, and I paid 36 eur!

The service was adequate, our waitress humoring us with our horrendous language skills. The host however, who came to actually take the order, was not interested in hospitality, and was rather curt. They delivered an amuse bouche, which was essentially a poached egg, in a mayonnaise based sauce. We enjoyed it, and looked forward to the rest of our meal.  Until it came. Our appetizers were both similarly mayonnaise - sauced. Forgive me for not remembering exactly what they were, but my lack of memory may be due to the forgettable nature of the dishes. My wife ordered a risotto for her entree, and when it arrived, it became the only non mayonnaise based sauce dish on the table for the evening, as my fish dish, advertised as having a red chili sauce, was covered in... Wait for it... Another mayonnaise based sauce. At this point I realized that perhaps a warning from the host as we ordered would've been appropriate.  Mayonnaise. It's been around for hundreds of years. Apparently though, the chef on duty the night we were there only recently discovered it. Perhaps earlier that day. It seemed like an off night, and there were hints of quality scattered through the evening (my wife's risotto being quite good,) but we will clearly not be returning.

We chose Paletilla de Cordero, an outstanding Godello white with a lemony bouquet. The food was up-to-date Spanish varying from exquisite pre-appetizer amuse-bouche of miniature bocadillos of steak tartar, light and fluffy ham croquetas, and mussels in a silver colored coating. We joined these with a lovely cava. Next we had an anchovy and red pepper lasagna which was vertically arranged without pasta. The meal progressed to a casserole Madrileño style for me, which was a mixture of various kinds of variety meats, except liver and kidneys, with small pieces of beef in a thickened tomato broth. My husband had a monkfish filet which was artfully and exquisitely plated and tender, unlike any monkfish he has had anywhere before. A friend had lamb shoulder chops with a sweet sauce. Dessert was the pièce de résistance. To celebrate John's birthday our friend ordered a meringue over a lemon tart with fresh mango--and a candle. To accompany this we had a chocolate egg with a hard shell filled with runny fudge. The finishing touch, Madrileño style, was a round of light gin and tonics with lemon peel and a red berry.

We tried to get in one night, but it was full. We made a reservation for next evening, trekked to the restaurant, again, because of a decent review in Lonely Planet, and a recommendation by an owner's friend. HOWEVER, we were given (bad) food we did not order, and they insisted we did...e.g., we ordered a pork stew with mashed potatoes, and got a blood pudding with fried eggs on bad french fries (which they had tried to pawn off on neighboring americans who had ordered sirloin). Some fatty beef dish was pawned off as the pork stew - and it was clearly beef! with a vile looking curd of a sauce. My ""secret loin"" was so secret, they kept it in the refrigerator without re-heating the both over and undercooked slabs of pork before serving. One saving grace was the very good roasted asparagus, but the other apps never came until we reminded them at entree serving, which was LITERALLY 1.5 hours after we ordered. When trying to reconcile this, they insisted we were wrong, had to argue! and it took three printings of the bill to get it to reflect what we actually sort of ate. They even charged us an extra person for bread and for an extra bottle of water: TWICE! The table next to us were lovely people from Ireland, and they too, had a similar experience with entrees coming out wrong, and the remainders over half an hour after their dinner partners were eating. Their neighbors also got their meals incorrectly. I was shocked. It really felt like we were intentionally were ignored all night. They've all perfected the ""I don't see you"" of obnoxious waiters.

We had...,My friend and I had dinner at La Bien Aparecida on the last night of our short break in Madrid. The restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend of a friend who was in fact Spanish and lived in the city. We had a table booked for 8pm which I believe was the time they started serving dinner. The food was delicious and I would have given a five star rating if I was just rating food but I have never in my life experienced such rushed service to the point of rudeness. We were given an amuse-bouche which was very pleasant and the second we put down our cutlery the plates were whipped away and our starters were served. We joked amongst ourselves saying that we hoped the main course wasn’t served up so quickly but alas I had barely put my fork down when these dishes were cleared away and lo and behold our main courses arrived. We were shocked and a little disappointed as we had wanted to savour our starters and let the food go down a little before eating our main courses. We also had a lovely bottle of wine to enjoy. We almost wanted to send the food back but didn’t want to risk getting it back re-heated so instead I called over a member of staff to say that we were very disappointed to be so rushed with our food. She apologised and left us to our meal. As mentioned before the food itself was extremely good but the overall experience was not enjoyable because of the rushed service. Also we were served by many different members of staff so they possibly were unaware of how quickly we were being served. After our main courses a dessert menu was thrust into our hands immediately the plates were cleared away and by this time I had had enough and asked to be left alone. We slowly enjoyed the rest of our wine and as a matter of principle did not order dessert as we were unhappy with our experience. We may have just been unlucky but surely someone knew how quickly we were being served up our food? I like to feel I am a fair person so wouldn’t say don’t come here as it was a lovely restaurant and the food was very good but it was such a shame we felt so rushed through the courses. I have completed this review in the hope that The Management will speak to staff/chefs to avoid this happening in future. All our dishes were served within 40 minutes of arriving.,2017-12-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8841099-Reviews-or30-La_Bien_Aparecida-Madrid.html,UID_37451,0.076,0.787,0.137,0.9822,0.1098581560283687,0.4933096926713947,0.5270529411764705,2287,240,0.104940970703979,0,21,False,86,0.0930232558139534,0.1550387596899224,0.2403100775193798,0.0542635658914728,0.1705426356589147,0.0465116279069767,0.0387596899224806,0.0465116279069767,0.0852713178294573,0.0697674418604651,437,215,4.2356979405034325,0,0,friend dinner la bien aparecida last night short break madrid restaur recommend us friend friend fact spanish live citi tabl book pm believ time start serv dinner food delici would given five star rate rate food never life experienc rush servic point rude given amus bouch pleasant second put cutleri plate whip away starter serv joke amongst say hope main cours serv quickli ala bare put fork dish clear away lo behold main cours arriv shock littl disappoint want savour starter let food go littl eat main cours also love bottl wine enjoy almost want send food back want risk get back heat instead call member staff say disappoint rush food apologis left us meal mention food extrem good overal experi enjoy rush servic also serv mani differ member staff possibl unawar quickli serv main cours dessert menu thrust hand immedi plate clear away time enough ask left alon slowli enjoy rest wine matter principl order dessert unhappi experi may unlucki sure someon knew quickli serv food like feel fair person say come love restaur food good shame felt rush cours complet review hope manag speak staff chef avoid happen futur dish serv within minut arriv,bad review,2

As we were not too hungry, we decided to order mains only. We also got some croquettes and petit fours after our meal as part of the meal. Our friends said to order fish - although as we had fish for lunch we tried some of the meat dishes.  I ordered the roast lamb shoulder which was way too large and I could only eat half of it as it was too rich. There were no vegetables with the meal other than two types of potatoes. My husband had the steak which he said was quite good.  Service was efficient. The decor was very nice. However the restaurant was very large and not too busy so lacked atmosphere.  The restaurant isn’t vegetarian friendly nor are there many dishes with a lot of vegetables for those who want lightener alternatives.

We made reservations before our trip directly on its website easily. It's located on the north side of Retiro Park, so we took a taxi from our hotel. If your hotel (visitor) is located near Plaza Mayor or Santa Ana, then you will need to take a cab.  Upon arrival, we were impressed with its sense of arrival. There were tables set outside for those who preferred. However, it was much too hot for us (even in late September) to do so. We were seated immediately upstairs. They have a downstairs as well, so they have plenty of seating. While walking to our table and once seated, we really admired the decor and design of the restaurant. You must pay attention to the wall decor and look for the gold knives, forks, spoons which from a distance simply look like fancy decorations. Up close, you'll see what I mean, so please look for this. It was quite creative and whimsical. Great design application. We were equally impressed with the lighting and light fixtures. It reminded us of another restaurant in New York City, called Le Coucou in lower Manhatten.  We were presented with a nice, large menu with a number of intersting items. My wife wanted to order some items off the menu, and our server was more than happy to accommodate us. This flexibility is so important to us and happy to see they could do this, unlike some other restaurants. My wife did order a ""Mixta Ensalada"" (mixed salad). I ordered the ""La Purrusalda"" (homemade pasta) as a hot starter (delicious) from the menu. In addition, my wife ordered the Free-range chicken rice on the menu, and I ordered a house special: Lomo de Rape Asado (roasted monkfish loin) as a main entree. Along with this, we enjoyed a great dessert on the menu: Sorpresa de Chocolate (chocolate surprise with citrus eucalyptus plus 70% cocoa ice cream (yum)! I should also point out that they also have a large and short menu available at a fixed price. We didn't try this.  The only initial issue we had was that our initial server did not speak enough English to understand us, and we didn't speak enough Spanish. Once this was identified, we quickly had another server who did.  So, we highly recommend this restaurant while in Madrid.",2019-03-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8841099-Reviews-or10-La_Bien_Aparecida-Madrid.html,UID_810,0.018,0.837,0.145,0.9948,0.2462589403350273,0.5520165160926029,0.3578222222222222,2304,186,0.0807291666666666,1,77,False,79,0.1639344262295081,0.180327868852459,0.3442622950819672,0.0491803278688524,0.1147540983606557,0.0327868852459016,0.0,0.0327868852459016,0.0491803278688524,0.0327868852459016,408,261,4.639705882352941,0,0,restaur caught eye first list travel leisur one recommend restaur made reserv trip directli websit easili locat north side retiro park took taxi hotel hotel visitor locat near plaza mayor santa ana need take cab upon arriv impress sens arriv tabl set outsid prefer howev much hot us even late septemb seat immedi upstair downstair well plenti seat walk tabl seat realli admir decor design restaur must pay attent wall decor look gold knive fork spoon distanc simpli look like fanci decor close see mean pleas look quit creativ whimsic great design applic equal impress light light fixtur remind us anoth restaur new york citi call le coucou lower manhatten present nice larg menu number interst item wife want order item menu server happi accommod us flexibl import us happi see could unlik restaur wife order mixta ensalada mix salad order la purrusalda homemad pasta hot starter delici menu addit wife order free rang chicken rice menu order hous special lomo de rape asado roast monkfish loin main entre along enjoy great dessert menu sorpresa de chocol chocol surpris citru eucalyptu plu cocoa ice cream yum also point also larg short menu avail fix price tri initi issu initi server speak enough english understand us speak enough spanish identifi quickli anoth server highli recommend restaur madrid,good review,4

The outdoor tables, even in January are warm and romantic (though we did not choose this option. The food is Spanish modern and everything our family of five tasted was a nearly perfect creation. We particularly enjoyed the wild clams from Sarten, the white gazpacho and the croquettes as appetizers. For main courses, the Hake in green sauce, with clams and white asparagus was a perfectly balanced dish, while the beef burgundy served in a Staub ceramic pot could easily stand up to any version in Paris. Rice dishes were also expertly prepared. Desserts were outstanding -- Tart Tatin, Chocolate volcano surprise with eucalyptus citric and 70% cacao chocolate ice cream were both delightful and creative.

It is one of three restaurants in Madrid under the same ownership. On the evening we were there the restaurant was busy and we felt that the tables were very close to each other - not ideal for a quiet relaxing conversation. We found the menu and wine list interesting and varied - not overly long but proving enough choices for the majority of tastes. We really enjoyed the dishes we chose - in terms of quality of produce used, cooking and presentation. Our overall rating of four ""stars"" reflects our rating of the food: our rating for service would be lower - three stars or even three stars minus. As regards the service it was professional but we felt that there was something of the factory production line about it. The standard of food and service seemed to matter to the owners but equally, if not more important, seemed to be turning over the tables and maximising the nightly number of covers. Each course was delivered quickly after the other and at the end of the meal the bill appeared almost immediately. For us it would be somewhere to go to eat rather than an enjoy a fine dining experience with an equal emphasis on food and service.
