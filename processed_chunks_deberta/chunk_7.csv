We were initially standing outside the restaurant to look at the menu for the following day and we were invited in to the restaurant just to experience the atmosphere and enjoy their delicious potato chips. Little did we know we were greeted by their amazing chef, Aldo! When we shared that my fiance was vegetarian he invited us to come back the following day and although a vegetarian burger is not on the menu, he said he would make one for us! We came back and had an even better experience. He created a black bean burger for my fiance from scratch that was filling and so delicious. I had a burger from the menu and it was also cooked to perfection, with great fries, and some of the best guacamole I've ever had. Everything on their menu is made fresh, and that was evident with the first bite into my burger and guacamole. We also had nachos and the chili was also delicious. In addition to the great food, the staff was just wonderful, they were friendly, and SO accommodating. We asked if they had sangria, they didn't have any but they made a fresh glass for us! The restaurant overall has a cool and chill vibe. They have some great art on the walls and good music. I would absolutely recommend this place!

This time around I searched for a new place (as Del Diego felt old fashioned and stuffy), and I found Salmon Guru. I checked out the Google reviews and it looked like a place to try. My better looking half and I stopped by in the late afternoon and sat at the bar. Our bartender whipped us up a couple of boulevardiers, which were almost as good as mine ;-) I don't recall what my wife had for her second round, but I had the ""pasión"", which was very good.

Then, our server Richard was absolutely the best! So enthusiastic, helpful, funny and on-the-ball. It was super busy (and rightly so) but he flirted between the tables like a pro and made everyone feel so welcome and looked after. The cocktails are amazing!!! And the food. It was gorgeous. Superb quality, imaginative menu, quick service. I honestly loved it. I wish I lived in Madrid just so I can go back here! Repeatedly. One note- book in advance. This place is super popular and I think we were very lucky to get a table without a reservation. We had to wait 30 minutes and there’s a system in place for those that show up without a booking...but it’s dependent on those with a booking vacating their table. So avoid disappointment and reserve your spot in advance. Trust me, it’ll be worth it!

We sat downstairs which is perhaps less appealing but this is not high end dining, its good everyday food. We started with Mozarella injected with pesto. Very tasty - but beware quite filling, then we had the pork fillet with blue cheese and apple sauce, and the ubiquitous Heuvos Rotos. The pork was the star - very tender and a surprising mix and balance of flavours. Most people that visit go for the paella which I am told is very nice (but also quite expensive). My advice is to take the advice of the staff - Alex did a great job of guiding us through, wish we had settled on all his recommendation as the two we had were great. Hes a nice guy too.

Arrived before 9pm, there were a few tables of people already filled. We were warmly greeted and offered a table.

We ordered two of their house cocktails and the hummus, then another round of cocktails and a selection of plates. Everything was fantastic. The drinks were mixed with fresh ingredients and served with beautiful garnish, the food was delicious and exceeded our expectations.

Our experience there was wonderful in every way: excellent food and drink, friendly service, relaxing atmosphere, and reasonable prices. We highly recommend Cacao Restobar for hungry, travel-weary tourists. We had a 20-minute wait for a table, which is not bad considering we arrived without a reservation on a Friday night. Next time, we’ll make a reservation; it’s easy enough to do online. The staff very nicely accommodated for our limited grasp of Spanish. For an appetizer, we shared an arepas sampler. It consisted of two full sized arepas rather than the four small ones in the description; no matter; they were delicious. An arepa is a corn bread round split and filled with a savory mixture of chicken, seafood, or other ingredients. The corn bread used is thicker than a tortilla, but not as cake-like as American “corn bread.” For entrees we had the sliced pork tenderloin with caramelized onions and goat cheese, the cuttlefish with roasted potatoes and salad, and the pabellon criolo (a traditional Venezuelan plate of pulled beef with rice, beans, plantains and a fried egg). The cuttlefish was described as “spicy,” but at our request they scaled back the heat to a mild level. The pork tenderloin was served over scalloped potatoes. The plantains with the pabellon criolo were savory rather than sweet, which combined very well with the other flavors on the plate. For beverages we shared a pitcher (jara) of sangria, and also a non-alcoholic pina colada and a non-alcoholic mango colada. All were quite sweet and served with a sprig of fresh spearmint (note there are plenty of non-sweet beverages available for those who prefer them). For dessert we shared a piece of the tres leches cake that others have recommended. It lived up to our high expectations; very sweet and almost custard-like in texture. Our server (manager? owner?) also brought us small servings of a creamy, coffee-flavored liquor “on the house.” A note about the background music, since it was mentioned by another reviewer: It does indeed consist of covers of Latin American pop standards; we could see the controlling computer monitor from our table, and the mix was clearly titled “Latino Acoustica.” Some songs are repeated in the mix, performed by different artists. It is understandable that the simple arrangements and repetition could be annoying to some; on the other hand, the setting is a restaurant, not a concert, and others might find it interesting to hear different artists’ acoustical takes on well-known tunes. Most important to us was the fact that the volume level was just right: loud enough to hear clearly if one wanted to listen, but not so loud as to hinder conversation. The restrooms are located up a short flight of stairs, and therefore not wheelchair accessible. The restaurant itself also had a few stairs at the main entrance. It is possible there is a second entrance without stairs, but we did not inquire about this.",2019-06-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10786717-Reviews-or70-Cacao_Restobar-Madrid.html,UID_3292,0.016,0.864,0.12,0.9952,0.1616225749559083,0.5174823633156966,0.2360166666666666,3013,224,0.0743445071357451,0,81,False,82,0.0897435897435897,0.1282051282051282,0.282051282051282,0.0641025641025641,0.1666666666666666,0.0512820512820512,0.0128205128205128,0.0256410256410256,0.1282051282051282,0.0512820512820512,504,304,4.98015873015873,0,0,dinner cacao restobar first day madrid june experi wonder everi way excel food drink friendli servic relax atmospher reason price highli recommend cacao restobar hungri travel weari tourist minut wait tabl bad consid arriv without reserv friday night next time make reserv easi enough onlin staff nice accommod limit grasp spanish appet share arepa sampler consist two full size arepa rather four small one descript matter delici arepa corn bread round split fill savori mixtur chicken seafood ingredi corn bread use thicker tortilla cake like american corn bread entre slice pork tenderloin caramel onion goat chees cuttlefish roast potato salad pabellon criolo tradit venezuelan plate pull beef rice bean plantain fri egg cuttlefish describ spici request scale back heat mild level pork tenderloin serv scallop potato plantain pabellon criolo savori rather sweet combin well flavor plate beverag share pitcher jara sangria also non alcohol pina colada non alcohol mango colada quit sweet serv sprig fresh spearmint note plenti non sweet beverag avail prefer dessert share piec tre lech cake other recommend live high expect sweet almost custard like textur server manag owner also brought us small serv creami coffe flavor liquor hous note background music sinc mention anoth review inde consist cover latin american pop standard could see control comput monitor tabl mix clearli titl latino acoustica song repeat mix perform differ artist understand simpl arrang repetit could annoy hand set restaur concert other might find interest hear differ artist acoust take well known tune import us fact volum level right loud enough hear clearli one want listen loud hinder convers restroom locat short flight stair therefor wheelchair access restaur also stair main entranc possibl second entranc without stair inquir,good review,4

The gentleman who was helping us (one of the owner’s at this family owned restaurant) was sweet, hospitable, and extremely attentive to us and our crazy toddler. He made recommendations to us about the menu and helped us with our toddler who didn’t want to play with his toys anymore and was quickly losing interest in our distractions. The owner grabbed some cars that his six year old son had left and let our baby play with them. It was wonderful.  The food was also incredible and made our experience top notch. We each ordered different arepas. Mine was chicken and cheese and my husband ordered a shredded beef one with a fried egg, plantains, and black beans. Both delicious.

The  Being of Latin decent we were all very excited seeing Cacaos menu as it was filled with a variety of choices. The Arepa ordered was the Pabellon Arepa, and one was more than enough to fill a hungry stomach. Filled with shredded beef, black beans, plantain, cheese and let's not forget the egg, it was mouthwateringly good. As a drink, I ordered the mango juice that ended up being more of a smoothy but so so good and refreshing.

Food: My wife and I came here twice, and in total ordered the patatas bravas, arepas, and croquettes. All were very well seasoned, and tasted great. Potatoes are covered in a sweet chili aioli, arepas are freshly made with a variety of options to fill it with. Chicken and beef were fantastic filling choices. Croquettes were as expected, but good. Drinks: Had beer and sangria. Sangria is a must if you enjoy good sangria. They make theirs fresh with brandy and fresh cinnamon, and it really shows in the flavor. Bartenders are A+. They know how to make all kinds of drinks, and are skilled at doing so. I asked for a carrajillo, and they delivered on point! Atmosphere: Small place with a few tables in the front and more in the back. Has a gastropub feel, except they will come to your table to take your order like a restaurant. It’s a bit dark inside, but it’s clean and the staff is welcoming. Pro Tip: Order the sangria and try the arepas. The owner is Venezuelan and his arepas reflect that style. Both the sangria and arepas are made with pride, and will be delicious.",2019-06-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10786717-Reviews-or60-Cacao_Restobar-Madrid.html,UID_6966,0.0,0.807,0.193,0.9928,0.239102564102564,0.5134615384615384,0.337911111111111,1189,105,0.088309503784693,1,37,False,57,0.175,0.225,0.275,0.075,0.175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.025,217,146,4.483870967741935,0,0,place small friendli staff know menu definit tri place time day food wife came twice total order patata brava arepa croquett well season tast great potato cover sweet chili aioli arepa freshli made varieti option fill chicken beef fantast fill choic croquett expect good drink beer sangria sangria must enjoy good sangria make fresh brandi fresh cinnamon realli show flavor bartend know make kind drink skill ask carrajillo deliv point atmospher small place tabl front back gastropub feel except come tabl take order like restaur bit dark insid clean staff welcom pro tip order sangria tri arepa owner venezuelan arepa reflect style sangria arepa made pride delici,good review,4

Really beautifully presented with an interesting choice of flavours and textures in the ‘short’ tasting menu which was excellent value for money. The wine menu was short but reasonably priced examples of good Spanish wines. I loved everything so I’ll simply pick some standouts !The double infusion that started this exciting culinary adventure was , at first blush, part of the table decoration: a glass vase with various dried mushrooms to which fresh herbs were added and then a bouillon that resulted in a rich umami broth. A one bite golden ball which burst in the mouth with flavours of the sea. A deconstructed Gazpacho with delicious ice cream and tomato drink was a revelation. Another stunning mushroom dish with the most delicate sabayon like sauce .My husband , not a great fan of duck was converted by the beautifully cooked duck and carrot dish, so tender.

The Montego Bay had just the perfect pitch of Fernet, and I'll be attempting to recreate it at home (ahem, Salmon, proportion hints are heartily welcome). But it's not just a drinks bar.

I made reservation 2 weeks in advance as I have read that it was a small restaurant and I wanted to go there while in Madrid based on the excellent reviews I read on Trip Advisor. I have to say that we were not disappointed. First of all, Maria contacted me a week before to enquire about my girlfriend food’s allergies and I thought it was a very nice touch. The setting is very simple but the food is sublime! I was very impressed with their tasting menu and I thought they gave Cebo a run for their money since I went there a few days prior. The food is absolutely amazing, lots of flavors and great creativity. Their tasting menu consisted of a total of 11 dishes I believe that include 2 desserts. The only suggestion I would give them is to work on their wine pairing but everything else was amazing! I will not be surprised if they earn a Michelin Star one day.

But that would be a big mistake. Huge (to quote a certain person) The chef here is doing amazing, bizarre, but incredible things with flavours and textures.  After a warm greeting from one of the waitstaff, you sit down, and notice what looks like a weird autumnal floral decoration, in a jug, on your table.  But that turns out of be one of your starters! A ""double infusion"" of mushrooms, garlic, lemongrass and a whole host of other ingredients (each dish was explained as it was presented, but without either recording it, or asking them to repeat it several times, there is no way I would remember everything), served as a wonderful consommé, the rich flavours of which set the scene for the rest of the evening! I could probably write a review of each course, but given there were 4 starters, bread, fish, 2 meat courses and 2 desserts, I'd be here all night Standouts (although it's like trying to pick your favourite children!) were the Cod, the Duck, the ""Lamb Sandwich"" and the Mushroom dish with Meringue pieces (not joking) After the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Salted Caramel Ice-cream and curry powder (still not joking), the waitress brought out 2 leaves on a plate, explaining that they were to cleanse the palate before the last course, and that we should not think so much about the flavour as the feeling (?) So, to the wife's comment of ""It looks like privet"" we chewed away, only to experience the plant equivalent of Space Dust, leaving our mouths tingling - we just burst out laughing at the sheer playfulness of it. All of this is done for €48 for the short menu or €63 for the long - about a quarter of the price you'd pay at somewhere like DiverXO (and without the 6 month waiting list) I can't believe that this place isn't higher up the rankings, or that we were lucky enough to find it, after some random trawling of TA.

I surfed the internet and I was positively impressed by the comments about this restaurant made by other travellers. I felt welcomed from the first moment I stepped into the door, the place was packed altough the noice level was more than acceptable, allowing people to have conversation without having to shout, thanks to the phono-absorbent panels I guess. I was lucky enought to get a table, the place looks nice, the look is modern and rich, without exageration, everything seems to be just right. The waiter arrived and informed me that he would have gone for reduced portions as I was eating by myself and their normal portions are very abundant, which sounded to me like good news and a right start. The starter arrived after a few minutes, croguettes flowers, covered in a delicious Spanish wine sauce, and filled with a tasty and creamy local cheese. I was surprised by how good it tasted it, even the best review could not really make me realize the level of cooking that this restaurant is able to deliver.  The main course was even better, and it was a lot of tender meat, guarnished with vegetables and potatoes, melting in my mouth. After the coffee, I was prepared to pay what I thought the meal worthed, I was expecting to see an expensive check, but at that point, I was sooooo happy with the experience I had, I could not think about anything else. When I saw that the total was €28, for starter, main course, 2 cervezas and coffee, I was super astonished, happily surprised, especially considering the impeccable quality and freshness of the ingredients.

A friendly & attentive owner/manager supported by young, friendly & knowledgeable staff. It was the first restaurant I have been to where the staff recommend half portions, but they were right the half portions were still generous & really delicious. I took one contributor's recommendation & had the eggs with the chorizo meat - really simple but delicious. We also enjoyed the medallions of pork loin with caramelised onions & Brie. We even shared the dessert - unlike many places it was big enough to share. We ordered wine by the glass, which was topped up but we were only charged for one glass each. They certainly know how to treat customers & were obviously very popular with locals of all ages. I was glad we had booked as it was full, both upstairs & down.

So my wife and I showed up a bit early, having arrived during the day after a long flight. I guess it was about 6:30 pm, on our way to flamenco. Since we were the first customers, and bartender was friendly, we decided to sit down and have a glass of wine. If God had decided to open up a tapas restaurant, he would have chosen Alcaravea Gaztambide. After taking pity on us, they opened up the kitchen a bit early. My wife and I told the bartender that we would leave the ordering to him--which I recommend usually when I'm traveling. We had a beatiful, fresh salad, and the most amazing octopus in a saffron infused sauce...it really took a lot for my wife to eat octopus, after a rather troubling experience in Turkey, but alas, it was devine. While the bartender entertained us and gave us some great recommendations for Madris, we hungrily downed a beef tapas, while watching Charlie Chaplin movies. Have I discussed the Chaplin movies? whatever you do when you goto Alcaravea, don't mention the Chaplin movies, apparently their is a bit of controversy between the owner and the staff regarding the entertainment value of the Chaplin movies. No, in all seriousness, it felt like the bar that you walk into from a movie set, and you don't want to leave. We walked out stuff, energiized, and ready for flamenco. If you goto Madrid, pity not to stop by....they will treat you like a long lost friend.

I only have great things to say about this place... not ONE negative comment to make I stumbled upon this restaurant thanks to TripAdvisor as it happens. At the time it was in the top three places to eat in Madrid - it still should be! - and as I lived in the center it wasn't difficult to get to.  While the first time we went was on a weekday early evening, so we were able to walk right in, friday to sunday dinners I would suggest booking in advance. Even during subsequent visits, when there were only two of us and we hadn't booked, the warm and welcoming staff were happy to make space even if it meant shifting a few tables.  The first thing I noticed about this place when walking in was the mouthwatering aroma of beautifully cooked Spanish food lingering in the air. In both restaurants the owner would personally seat us, keep conversation flowing throughout the dining experience and always be available for advice and recommendations. The staff all spoke perfect English, and even the owner of the Gaztambide branch who wasn't quite as fluent, would make jokes in Spanglish and recognize me everytime I came back.  Not only is this place perfectly romantic for couples, I went twice with family (just 2-3 of us) and another few times with a massive group of friends, which didn't make the service and food any less personable and punctual. I insisted some of my Spanish friends should book it for their birthdays, and they all raved about it and congratulated me on the fantastic find, all wishing that they had discovered the place years ago in their own hometown. Even my foodie friend whose parents own a restaurant took her family here and they were just bowled over. Which seems to be the general reaction. As for the food, be it recommendations from the staff, or the complimentary 'amuse-bouche' that came with every meal (from many types of warm fresh bread and cheeses, to tangy shots of gazpacho) or the array of amazing desserts (and I learnt that Spain weren't the best at cakes and desserts, perhaps it's their flour.... but this place changed that perception in seconds) It was all absolutely breathtaking. If I didnt have favourites that I would continually choose, I would have loved to get through the entire menu. ahhh the favourites (see pictures)... MUST ORDER:  -Kilo of Kobe Beef Now i'm not a steak/beef/burger fan whatsoever. It's always been too chewy for me, or lacking flavour. So when (only thanks to a recommendation by the staff) we ordered a kilo of Kobe beef, rare and still moo-ing on the plate (at a ridiculously cheap price of £30) which came with potatoes and green peppers, i was a little apprehensive. It was the most succulent, melt-in-the-mouth, delicious meat I had ever tasted. And the portion was so huge, but too delectable to waste. This dish alone is a reason for anyone to come here. -Croquettas (especially the goats cheese and honey) Delicate, perfectly crispy on the outside and silky smooth on the inside. Possibly the best croquettas I've tasted... and I've had a fair few in my day -Calamari Commonly overcooked, chewy and bland. Not this time! Perfection -Desserts Because you couldn't possibly choose as everyone of the desserts are heavenly. But the Tiramisu inside a toblerone is a stroke of genius!!! Even though we were bursting at the seams from all the food, we HAD to have some of this. We ended up waddling home, our bellies pregnant with the tastiest meal I'd eaten in a very long time. But the real icing on the cake was the bill at the end. For such attentive, creative fine-dining the price was extremely reasonable, making Alcaravea free from that 'fine-dining' pretentious nature.  Honest, humble food made with heart and passion. No wonder Spain has been a contender for the best restaurants in the world this past decade. I implore you.... don't miss out.",2014-01-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3544145-Reviews-or30-Alcaravea_Gaztambide-Madrid.html,UID_7086,0.028,0.817,0.155,0.9984,0.2400828812537673,0.5768655816757081,0.425584375,4002,332,0.0829585207396301,5,130,False,127,0.14,0.14,0.32,0.01,0.2,0.0,0.02,0.04,0.1,0.03,695,405,4.752517985611511,0,0,speak alcaravea sister restaur alcaravea gaztambid review visit numer occas month madrid great thing say place one neg comment make stumbl upon restaur thank tripadvisor happen time top three place eat madrid still live center difficult get first time went weekday earli even abl walk right friday sunday dinner would suggest book advanc even subsequ visit two us book warm welcom staff happi make space even meant shift tabl first thing notic place walk mouthwat aroma beauti cook spanish food linger air restaur owner would person seat us keep convers flow throughout dine experi alway avail advic recommend staff spoke perfect english even owner gaztambid branch quit fluent would make joke spanglish recogn everytim came back place perfectli romant coupl went twice famili us anoth time massiv group friend make servic food less person punctual insist spanish friend book birthday rave congratul fantast find wish discov place year ago hometown even foodi friend whose parent restaur took famili bowl seem gener reaction food recommend staff complimentari amus bouch came everi meal mani type warm fresh bread chees tangi shot gazpacho array amaz dessert learnt spain best cake dessert perhap flour place chang percept second absolut breathtak didnt favourit would continu choos would love get entir menu ahhh favourit see pictur must order kilo kobe beef steak beef burger fan whatsoev alway chewi lack flavour thank recommend staff order kilo kobe beef rare still moo ing plate ridicul cheap price came potato green pepper littl apprehens succul melt mouth delici meat ever tast portion huge delect wast dish alon reason anyon come croquetta especi goat chees honey delic perfectli crispi outsid silki smooth insid possibl best croquetta tast fair day calamari commonli overcook chewi bland time perfect dessert possibl choos everyon dessert heavenli tiramisu insid tobleron stroke geniu even though burst seam food end waddl home belli pregnant tastiest meal eaten long time real ice cake bill end attent creativ fine dine price extrem reason make alcaravea free fine dine pretenti natur honest humbl food made heart passion wonder spain contend best restaur world past decad implor miss,good review,4

The food was lovely and fresh and the gentleman serving us was super friendly. The only problem was that he didn't write anything down. The gentleman was very happy to talk with me about which dishes we could adapt to make them vegan... But then the nachos came out with cheese on. The waiter was more than happy to take them back and get me a fresh plate without cheese. Then my main didn't come out at all (vegetable strudel).

This is a fun, relaxed place, the welcome is genuinely warm and the food is wholesome and hearty. The house Mojito is pretty fantastic too! Our starters were delicious, garlic prawns and fried cheese sticks with a yummy dip. My husband had the fajitas which he said were tasty and I had the prawn risotto which was a little bit light on taste but when the waiter noticed I hadn't eaten it all he said I was only going to pay half because I'd only eaten half - a lovely touch but I felt so bad, he really cared. We had room for dessert - thank goodness, they were amazing, passion fruit pie and a cheesecake - both superb! All in all this is a lively, casual place with good food.

We wanted clear tastes, hot food, fresh ingredients and something different. And this was certainly the place. The food was tasty, spicy, delicate, and wonderful.

However when we ordered two “super tapas” dishes - a spicy aioli potato dish and the tacos, we were presented with a minuscule bowl containing all of one single potato chopped up into squares. The two tacos were equally tiny, each one smaller than the size of a hand. After seeing the same dish served to the spanish people next to us which was easily double the size, we complained about our bill, to which the waitress immediately and without question amended our bill for the potatoes to the price for the smaller size (not at all for the tacos, despite them being nothing like the picture). Her being totally unsurprised just approved our suspicions that they regularly attempt to scam young tourists like ourselves. If you go here, be sure to check your bill twice or three times and have a good look at what they serve to the Spanish customers compared to yourselves.

(In fairness, we might not have been disappointed had the reviews on Tripadvisors not ranked this so highly. Mind you, we wouldn't have gone at all. I'm shocked at the Tripadvisor ranking!) We were charged 40 Euro for not much: two coffees, three hot chocolates and five bland sandwiches (small white buns with a bit of ham and crushed tomatoes). The hot chocolate was actually a cup of milk with a packet of nearly flavourless powder to mix in ourselves. The tomatoes tasted and looked tinned. Certainly not fresh local produce. A friendly owner/employee chattered away and handed over cheap trinkets that we would never want to purchase (repeatedly saying ""my treat""). We were shocked at the bill (we never received a menu and just acceited the recommended meal, and so we didn't know what the price would be) But we smiled and paid and handed over the usual European tip: the small change. The employee/owner took the tray with the change and with a big smile asked ""tip?"". But when he saw the small change he was suddenly not so friendly anymore. The smile vanished and he walked away without a word. (Perhaps more generous tips are oftentimes given - and have come to be expected- from non-Europeans.)

I am not surprised since some of the things we ordered were very far from what I would call authentic Mexican food, unfortunately. I asked for enchiladas verdes and was given some tortillas swimming in a sort of cheese or bechamel sauce. A friend of ours ordered some Cochinita pibil tacos and he ate half of one and gave the rest away. I tried one and it wasn’t what it should have been. Pork covered in lard is not cochinita pibil. And I don’t write lard to be funny, the meat was soaked in grease.  The service was nice, or not, depending on the waiter waiting on you. The Spanish waiter was very friendly and nice, whereas his Mexican colleague I guess was having a bad day. Lastly, we waited around 40 minutes between our first course (basically ceviche and guacamole for three) and the main course. When we asked the waiter about our food he left and came back saying it would be coming up shortly, but we still had to wait for it to arrive about 5 more minutes. I don’t think understand why a restaurant of all places would think its ok to leave such a long gap in between courses. As a parting thought, the place really needs to revamp the toilets. The massive spiderweb wasn’t very nice to look, among other things. I wont be going there again or recommended this place to any of my friends.

There are tourist traps that are 150% marked up, but our friends from Scandinavia and London don’t realize because Spain is so reasonable. There are places that have paella, and are rated highly even though they have meh paella because the other tourists haven’t figured out that all paella is good, but they’re not having anything special.  Then there’s Real Talent Cafe. Off in a side street away from the major tourist hubs, this place has it all. Unbelievable, authentic paella made on the spot (~30 minutes to cook, so you know it’s real); homemade bread and pasta; excellent service; and reasonable prices. My goodness!

We entered a few minutes and were greeted with a big smile and hello from Reyni who asked if we would like a glass of wine before dinner. She made suggestions and allowed us to taste a few reds and whites. We were able to comfortably enjoy a glass of wine before our dinner and had a nice talk with Reyni who told us about the various wines that you can purchase. We settled on a very nice bottle of Tempranillo. Our dinner started off with the best breads we have had on our trip in either Portugal or Spain. The Olive oil enhances all of the bread selections. For starters we had the pate and foie and Beluga lentils. My wife had the Tourbot and I had the Iberian Ham cheeks. For dessert we had the Chocolate Toutin with ice cream and finished with a lovely dessert wine. The service and food was excellent we give the entire experience 5 Stars only because we can only give 5. This is a 10 star restaurant. They do not rush you so plan on spending time here.

Even from the street the upstairs wine shop is elegant and tasteful. Although we had a feeling Las Carboneras de Lu might be very very nice, we and our friends were in for a stunning gastronomic and visual treat. The downstairs restaurant could not be more beautiful, refined and romantic. From the bottles enclosed in the staircase to brick wine cellar motif to the soft lighting, we instantly sat down and said around the table, ""This place is incredible!"" And that's before the service started. And when the service did start, we instantly saw that no detail was left to chance. The staff was extremely well trained and politely attentive without being distracting. We were immediately served a salted edamame, followed by an excellent amuse bouche. We each shared a bottle of Pinot Noir Rose Cava, which was excellent. Lourdes, the co-owner recommended an excellent Madrid-area Ganache. And then the courses started to arrive. My wife shared the stuffed pasta (a thousand apologies to Lourdes and her husband that I don't know the exact name of each dish), while I shared the pate and foie gras plate. Both looked beautiful and were fantastic. Our friends ordered the boneless beef steak, which they couldn't stop raving about. I had the beef cheeks with root vegetables and it was amazing. My wife was served the suckling pig, which was cooked for a loving 9 hours. When she shared a bite, It was one of the best single bites of food I've ever had. My first thought was, ""I'd fly back to Madrid just to have this single dish."" It really was that good. Ending with dessert, my friend and I had the lemon pie, which was simply exquisite. So good, I forget what my wife had- my friend had ordered a lemon pie as well and we just couldn't stop talking about it. Throughout the evening, the staff could not have been more polite nor more professional. The ladies' dishes were simultaneously removed first, followed by the mens'. Every detail was attended to promptly and politely. We learned that Lourdes and her husband have been open a mere 5 months. They have done an absolutely amazing job with the restaurant and the wine shop. They are absolutely lovely people. If you are in Madrid and you appreciate fine dining, you have to treat yourself to their lovely restaurant. I hope this restaurant and the lovely founders have all the success in the world. You can tell they've poured themselves into Las Carboneras de Lu!

Our meal was at 9pm we arrived slightly early and there were 14 of us with about 10 other diners in the restaurant. We ordered three options each which were Mexican style tapas. Long story short two of us still had no food two hours later with the rest of us served just one of our tapas. The two waiters weren't just standing around but seemed unable to get drinks or help us out in any kind of reasonable time. They explained the kitchen was just one person who made everything fresh but it took 4 hours to complete our meal and they have very simple food. The chef clearly had no prep done that day and started what he/she needed to do as orders came In. They gave no discount off the bill and no compensation by way of a drink and we didn’t get out of the restaurant till nearly 1am! When the food did come it wasn’t great and the mixed platters meant that we got confused and people didn’t get what they ordered or all of it.

Often times trying out a random restaurant can lead to disappointing results, but that was not the experience this time. It was a fantastic choice . The host, Diego, easily found us a table in the packed dining room. He put us at ease with his charm and attentiveness. It was obvious that the whole staff strives to make their guests’ dining experience the best possible. The dining room is decorated with distressed wood, metals, interesting architectural features, and pleasantly low lighting. It was at the same time romantic and great for a group of friends.  Among other things we ordered croquetas de carabinero (fantastic!), torrenzo con su Corteza, and gambones crujientes (crunchy prawns). The chef clearly knew what he was doing with seasoning and ingredients representative of the region, and all of the plating was beautiful.

We enjoyed it so much, we came back a second time. Unfortunately, we had a miss with the TBone, which had a really tough section that we couldn't even get our teeth through. Also, the cocktail bar that gets such good reviews was closed, since it was August, but the restaurant made some fantastic gin and tonics, which seem to be a specialty in Madrid.

I visited for the first time on a Sunday night so the restaurant was fairly quiet, which created a very nice atmosphere. We were greeted as soon as we came in. Service was very polite and made us feel very comfortable. We ordered some guacamole with nachos, quesadillas suizas and taco de tinga. We were presented with a set of complimentary sauces which were delicious and went well with everything we ordered. As a dessert, we had the cheesecake with dulce de leche. Everything was very, very nicely presented. You could see a lot of care had gone into the food and presentation. I have to say the guacamole was one of the best I’ve ever tried, if not the best!

I choose a great piece of flounder and my wife had lobster lasagne. Plus starters of shrimp croquettes.  I also ordered fried pig ear to go out on a limb and when I did not care for it they amazingly took it off our bill without my saying anything! Desert was chocolate dipped strawberries and cafe americano. Plus they brought us 2 lovely after dinner drinks with the compliments of the house.

The setting is modern and stylish with attentive, helpful and friendly staff. The wine list is extensive with well priced choices by the bottle and glass; the staff are happy to advise without pushing for the most expensive choice. The menu is well balanced for meat and fish, although not many vegetarian options. The courgette appetiser was gorgeous and the crispy pork belly was beautifully presented and tasted even better. The tuna tartare was equally visually appealing and had my tastebuds tingling. In all, this was an excellent meal in an stylish setting all helped along by friendly and attentive staff. It cost €65 for 3 courses and a glass of wine for 2 people - good value for what we had. This is well worth taking the short walk off the beaten tourist trail to visit.

There was a small confusion about our reservation (that took no time), and Diego sent drinks to our table at the end to apologize. The food was a great mix of modern and traditional, with unusual flavors and combinations. I particularly liked the tuna tartare, and for those in Spain longing for something healthy, the Power Bowl salad was just perfect. We had a relaxed evening on the comfortably cushioned seats, great wine, and many interesting tastes.

Well, it’s difficult to explain our overall surprise and pleasure at this establishment, however, I’ll try. Right from the entry, there’s a glass rectangle in the floor over which you must step to enter. As you look down, you have a bird’s eye view of a private dining room in the restaurant below. This glass area showcases the place where coal, (for heating the building), was delivered in ages past. Yes, this restaurant has an interesting history. Then you proceed through a small but charming wine store to the staircase which takes you one floor below to the restaurant. Mostly done in brick to resemble a beautiful wine cellar, the restaurant is extraordinarily lovely, with elegant touches everywhere – from wall color to decorations to paintings to stiffly starched table cloths & napkins, to striking table settings. Incredibly pleasing and stylishly furnished. The restaurant consists of several gorgeous interconnecting dining rooms The food was absolutely the best part. Executive chef Lourdes Poveda is a culinary genius, she, along with seven other expert & talented chefs prepare your delicious meals. They spare no detail - everything is freshly prepared, elegantly plated (on striking dinner ware ) and lavishly served. Make sure you observe the chic dinner plates, as a different style is used for each course. We selected a tasting menu of 5 courses + dessert and each one was better than the next. At the end, we couldn’t tell which course we liked best…..they were all delightfully delicious. What an amazing treat! Dessert was good too, the best lemon concoction I’ve ever had - one more pleasing surprise at the end! We will remember this place for a long time to come and find every opportunity to visit each time we are in Madrid. By the way, Executive Chef Lourdes owns the restaurant along with her charming husband who is the extremely knowledgeable and attentive sommelier. He hand selects your wine once he knows your preference, and if you don’t know what you want – all the better because are in for a good surprise. He does know his stuff! During the course of your dinner Executive Chef Lourdes visits your table to ensure your satisfaction. She comments on any given course and encourages your questions. She is just as delightful ad the food she prepares. Service was remarkably impeccable – a couple of times, I dropped my napkin on the floor by my feet. Each time it was noticed, retrieved and a fresh one was returned to me on a platter, beautifully folded and served to me with tongs – no human hands touching it! Price is remarkably moderate for this one of a kind gem in Madrid. If you love superb food and outstanding service, you owe it to yourself to visit.",2019-05-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13374563-Reviews-or20-Restaurante_Las_Carboneras_de_Lu-Madrid.html,UID_7414,0.012,0.695,0.293,0.9996,0.4077346143135617,0.6541840712893346,0.313662962962963,2834,210,0.0741002117148906,4,63,False,93,0.1074380165289256,0.1652892561983471,0.3884297520661157,0.0578512396694214,0.1322314049586777,0.0082644628099173,0.0165289256198347,0.0495867768595041,0.0495867768595041,0.024793388429752,488,300,4.807377049180328,0,0,recent privileg take group profession restaur dinner person total well difficult explain overal surpris pleasur establish howev tri right entri glass rectangl floor must step enter look bird eye view privat dine room restaur glass area showcas place coal heat build deliv age past ye restaur interest histori proceed small charm wine store staircas take one floor restaur mostli done brick resembl beauti wine cellar restaur extraordinarili love eleg touch everywher wall color decor paint stiffli starch tabl cloth napkin strike tabl set incred pleas stylishli furnish restaur consist sever gorgeou interconnect dine room food absolut best part execut chef lourd poveda culinari geniu along seven expert talent chef prepar delici meal spare detail everyth freshli prepar elegantli plate strike dinner ware lavishli serv make sure observ chic dinner plate differ style use cours select tast menu cours dessert one better next end tell cours like best delight delici amaz treat dessert good best lemon concoct ever one pleas surpris end rememb place long time come find everi opportun visit time madrid way execut chef lourd own restaur along charm husband extrem knowledg attent sommeli hand select wine know prefer know want better good surpris know stuff cours dinner execut chef lourd visit tabl ensur satisfact comment given cours encourag question delight ad food prepar servic remark impecc coupl time drop napkin floor feet time notic retriev fresh one return platter beauti fold serv tong human hand touch price remark moder one kind gem madrid love superb food outstand servic owe visit,good review,4

The set up and decorations in the restaurant are really beautiful, and we loved walking through the wine shop before going down into the restaurant. The service was outstanding - Lourdes, the chef, actually came out to check in on us several times in between courses and then spoke to us after our meal and showed us around the restaurant. This was especially nice as you don't often get a chance to speak with the chef of such a high quality restaurant. And of course, the food (and the wine) was all spectacular.

The idea, to place a restaurant in the cave of a wine merchant is intriguing. The wine cellar itself is just a small room, with about 200 different wines, mainly from Spain and France. We startet with a nice glass of Champagne and they talked us into a wine from the Madrid area to accompany our dinner.  Then they walked us down to the restaurant, it was nearly empty (at 9pm), but during the evening, all tables (about 10 tables) were taken. The chef greeted us and we asked her to suggest something. We started with a small amuse bouche, followed with an excellent zucchini flowers in tempura, filled with bacelao, then Bacelao Negro, quail, tournedos with foie gras and as dessert, lemon pie and torrija de panettone. Our wine “Initio” by Las Moradas de San Martin was excellent and for the sweets we had two glasses of Pedro Ximenez and Moscatel plus two coffees and mineral water. We have been to very good restaurants all around the world, but the “LU experience” was one we will never forget: Outstanding cuisine in a cozy atmosphere, excellent wines, very good service for a very fair price (EURO 172 for two persons). Thank you Lourdes for this experience; we will come back for sure!

Having chosen Las Carbs on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews we were delighted with our choice. You enter through an upscale wine shop and descend into a surprisingly light and airy former coal cellar. Like all good restaurants they do the little things really well - three types of lovely bread, great butter, an amuse bouche of warm edamame peas. The cooking is technically excellent and highly skilful - apparently it takes 20 minutes to debone a quail - roughly twice as long as it takes to eat one. The service was delightful, with the lady chef coming out to explain each dish (there were only around twenty covers on a midweek lunchtime, I doubt she can manage this at the weekends). We trusted wine selection the sommelier and were very pleased. We were trying to refuse pudding when the chef said she had a cheesecake with truffle honey. It isn’t on the menu but should be as it is sweet savoury heaven.

We went there following the good reviews in various sites and above all by looking at the menu in the website. It portrayed an image closer to an asador/normal restaurant than to a tasting menu place but we were completely off here. On that basis we were disappointed. The place is very uptight, in a good sense though. The service is impeccable and on top of you which is not necessarily what we were looking for on that day. The place itself is elegant and exuding good taste everywhere even though is set in an old coal storage place (hence the name). The food is good, nothing that wowed us though and that really was what we went for. Certainly more on the tasting side of things given the size of portions and the level of prices. This is the kind of place you will go with some business partners to drink some amazing wine (the place claim to have one the best bodegas in Madrid) and eat something good. The star of the place are the wines which you are immediately made aware of as soon as you enter the place. The fact of the matter is that we were not there for the alcohol. So given all this we can only review this place given our expectations and experience which undeniably has always a subjective component.",2019-05-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13374563-Reviews-or10-Restaurante_Las_Carboneras_de_Lu-Madrid.html,UID_7444,0.041,0.81,0.149,0.9836,0.3562499999999999,0.5520833333333334,0.4147416666666667,1330,138,0.1037593984962406,0,20,False,53,0.1639344262295081,0.1639344262295081,0.2786885245901639,0.0983606557377049,0.2131147540983606,0.0163934426229508,0.0163934426229508,0.0,0.0327868852459016,0.0163934426229508,250,143,4.324,0,0,place go famili celebr relax enjoy time went follow good review variou site look menu websit portray imag closer asador normal restaur tast menu place complet basi disappoint place uptight good sens though servic impecc top necessarili look day place eleg exud good tast everywher even though set old coal storag place henc name food good noth wow us though realli went certainli tast side thing given size portion level price kind place go busi partner drink amaz wine place claim one best bodega madrid eat someth good star place wine immedi made awar soon enter place fact matter alcohol given review place given expect experi undeni alway subject compon,bad review,2

Once we chose a delicious and recommended tempranillo, we were taken downstairs to our table. The staff were great with the actual restaurant and dining room lovely; however, the owner had one almighty attitude problem. We started with a shared cheese platter and was then promptly (and I mean literally not more than 5 minutes) followed with zucchini flowers. Both these dishes were delicious! My partner had the sucking pig for his mains which he thought was fabulous and I had the cod. I double checked with our waitress when ordering that it was a fillet with NO bones and she assured me it was.  My first mouthful I found a large bone so called over our waitress (who unbeknown to us was the owner), who said that it would be impossible for the chef to find all the bones without destroying the fish - so clearly, you’ll get some bones and then walked away. My third mouthful had another bone so I called her over again and asked her to remove my plate as I didn’t want it. There was no apology, no offer for another meal, just an argument in front of the other guests justifying the dish before turning and walking away again!  Once my partner finished eating I asked for the manager but was ignored. As we were getting ready to leave, I again asked for the manager and was told our waitress was the owner. She refused to come over to speak with us, so we left. It was such a shame as the rest of the staff were fantastic but her attitude really ruined our night. I’ve worked in fine dining establishments and would never have spoken to or treated my customers like that. It was embarrassing and I ultimately left hungry. Maybe if we had been a group of 20+ people we would have received the fabulous service that others appear to have had although, having said that, the owner doesn't even bother with the reviews or opinions of diners. Hopefully she'll receive enough negative ones to change her attitude!",2019-05-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13374563-Reviews-or10-Restaurante_Las_Carboneras_de_Lu-Madrid.html,UID_7446,0.071,0.802,0.127,0.9553,0.176570197044335,0.4830254515599343,0.5577588235294118,2116,193,0.0912098298676748,3,38,False,67,0.0857142857142857,0.0571428571428571,0.2285714285714285,0.0285714285714285,0.0428571428571428,0.0571428571428571,0.0714285714285714,0.0857142857142857,0.2,0.1428571428571428,384,233,4.5078125,0,0,arriv warm eclect restaur warmli greet wine shop upon sommeli encourag us tri local wine could pick bottl take dinner chose delici recommend tempranillo taken downstair tabl staff great actual restaur dine room love howev owner one almighti attitud problem start share chees platter promptli mean liter minut follow zucchini flower dish delici partner suck pig main thought fabul cod doubl check waitress order fillet bone assur first mouth found larg bone call waitress unbeknown us owner said would imposs chef find bone without destroy fish clearli get bone walk away third mouth anoth bone call ask remov plate want apolog offer anoth meal argument front guest justifi dish turn walk away partner finish eat ask manag ignor get readi leav ask manag told waitress owner refus come speak us left shame rest staff fantast attitud realli ruin night work fine dine establish would never spoken treat custom like embarrass ultim left hungri mayb group peopl would receiv fabul servic other appear although said owner even bother review opinion diner hope receiv enough neg one chang attitud,bad review,2

Food - To start we ordered onion bhaji’s and were given complimentary mini poppadoms and chutneys. On hearing that my wife loves spice, the waiter brought over a separate curry paste for her which she thoroughly enjoyed. For mains, we asked for advice and the waiter was very happy to learn about what we like, our spice levels etc. We opted for a chicken tikka masala and a chicken vindaloo. We also ordered boiled rice and roti’s.  When the food arrived, the waiter checked that it was to our satisfaction and I commented that both lovely but one dish could be hotter in the spice department. I want to note that the food was delicious and we were happy but the waiter took the dish away as he said the chef will get it to our likening. On return, the dish was perfect, and we were blown away with how much the waiter really cared and went to the effort he did.  The portion sizes were great also, we were offered our leftovers to take away but as we were moving on to bars, we declined but nice touch. We were also given a complimentary mango drink and jelly sweets, again nice touch. Service - Amazing! Wish we had taken note of the waiters name but he was excellent. Very polite and friendly, even understood our Scottish accents! Overall - When we come back to Madrid we will definitely return, that’s if we don’t go back before we head home! You need to visit as this is one of the better Indian restaurants in Madrid.",2019-06-14,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7311563-Reviews-or20-Purnima_Indian_Restaurant-Madrid.html,UID_7493,0.0,0.746,0.254,0.9981,0.3905092592592592,0.6175925925925925,0.2302235294117647,1574,135,0.0857687420584498,4,33,False,63,0.1228070175438596,0.2105263157894736,0.3508771929824561,0.0175438596491228,0.1929824561403508,0.0,0.0,0.0526315789473684,0.0350877192982456,0.0175438596491228,289,173,4.442906574394463,0,0,visit purnima thursday night felt compel write review food outstand decor modern chic tast decor food start order onion bhaji given complimentari mini poppadom chutney hear wife love spice waiter brought separ curri past thoroughli enjoy main ask advic waiter happi learn like spice level etc opt chicken tikka masala chicken vindaloo also order boil rice roti food arriv waiter check satisfact comment love one dish could hotter spice depart want note food delici happi waiter took dish away said chef get liken return dish perfect blown away much waiter realli care went effort portion size great also offer leftov take away move bar declin nice touch also given complimentari mango drink jelli sweet nice touch servic amaz wish taken note waiter name excel polit friendli even understood scottish accent overal come back madrid definit return go back head home need visit one better indian restaur madrid,very good review,5

We had the Vegetable Semosa for an appetizer. Be warned: They are very large. It can/should be shared. We also had the chicken tandoori and chicken curry. Chicken was well cooked. I think the curry could have been more spicy but it was still nice mild.  Overall: food was good, owners/workers were extremely nice, and environment relaxing. Excellent place for a casual dinner.

Most are stuck in a 70's flock wallpaper time warp and have never had a second thought about modernising either in interior design or food. Purnima is unfortunately one of those. All the dishes had the same consistency and same colour and the nan bread was stodgy - the menu? All the old favourites. Nothing is very spicy because the Spanish tend not to like spicy (hot) food. Anyone who gave this place 5 stars needs to get out more.....,2016-04-19,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7311563-Reviews-or150-Purnima_Indian_Restaurant-Madrid.html,UID_7538,0.119,0.881,0.0,-0.8776,0.0680555555555555,0.3777777777777777,0.1593857142857143,555,46,0.0828828828828828,0,17,False,18,0.1052631578947368,0.1052631578947368,0.2105263157894736,0.0,0.2105263157894736,0.1578947368421052,0.0526315789473684,0.0,0.1052631578947368,0.0526315789473684,103,80,4.398058252427185,0,0,madrid poor histori indian restaur live year hit miss mainli miss stuck flock wallpap time warp never second thought modernis either interior design food purnima unfortun one dish consist colour nan bread stodgi menu old favourit noth spici spanish tend like spici hot food anyon gave place star need get,bad review,2

Overall food is good. Place is really clean. Staff nice and cheery and helpful. Downside, we ordered a bottle of wine which was corked , tasted and smelt dreadful and had to be sent back. I was told i would have to pay for a replacement but i refused. There was no manager to consult and staff seemed worried about having an unpaid bottle of wine in the system. As none of them drank i couldn´t prove the bad taste to them but i made them smell it and compared it with a same brand but different bottle being used to serve wine by the glass from the bar. It smelt so bad that they eventually gave me another bottle which was fine. I offered them my mobie number if their missing manager wanted to discuss this further.  Apart from that everything was good and i would go back. I´d like to say Hakim was very helpful throughout and speaks really good English as do a few other members of staff.  More detailed info if you need it... There are 3 ´menus´ ( at 11.90, 25 and 35 euros) plus the a la carte. Starters are between 5.50 and 11 euros. Mains between 11.50 ( chicken) to 15 euros ( king prawns dishes). Lamb is around 13 euros. I didn´t have room for dessert so can´t comment on that.  Personally i wasn´t too impressed with the choice on offer in opening price point menu which served bhaji, chicken soup, salad, ( forgot 4th option) and mains such as Dhal, Dhamsak , none of the common more favourable dishes available here but the 25 euros menu showed a lot of promise with bhajis, samosas etc...to choose from and mains such as CTM and madras among others. You also get a veg side dish in this menu along with nan or rice. A dessert or coffee at the end. None of the menus include a drink.  Rice portions are really good. ( 4 euros for plain 5 euros for pilau) Recently we have had to order a 2nd portion of rice - many restaurants are cutting back on portion size - but this time we just ordered 2 straight away as we were really hungry so we were quite surprised when 2 deep pots of rice were delivered to our table so much so we had to bring nearly a whole portion home with us. Nan bread was lovely. Soft , fluffy, freshly cooked. We got 3 medium sized bjajis which were a lovely starter with a choice of 3 sauces, not amazing but ok. We ordered lamb balti and chicken bhuna. Chicken dishes seem to be bigger coming in a wide rounded curry dish where as lamb dishes come in a bucket style pot which has a false base half way up so it seems you get a smaller portion if you order lamb...costs i guess. Anyway both curries were nice, the lamb being the better option but no spice/heat at all even though we asked for ´medium´. As mentioned before the staff were great and took our curries away to make them spicier. Upon returning the smiling waiter said ( inEnglish) please tell the waiter next time that you are English so he can make a note for the chefs who will make you a ´medium´spiced english curry.  More suited for couples, friends and business. Dont think you can get around too easily with a pram and 2 flights of stairs to the loos.",2016-01-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7311563-Reviews-or150-Purnima_Indian_Restaurant-Madrid.html,UID_7543,0.052,0.824,0.124,0.9937,0.0842132505175983,0.5005866114561766,0.2619718749999999,3091,259,0.0837916531866709,0,74,False,132,0.1031746031746031,0.1428571428571428,0.2142857142857142,0.0634920634920634,0.1587301587301587,0.0476190476190476,0.0396825396825396,0.0634920634920634,0.0873015873015873,0.0793650793650793,592,344,4.214527027027027,0,0,parti lunch overal food good place realli clean staff nice cheeri help downsid order bottl wine cork tast smelt dread sent back told would pay replac refus manag consult staff seem worri unpaid bottl wine system none drank prove bad tast made smell compar brand differ bottl use serv wine glass bar smelt bad eventu gave anoth bottl fine offer mobi number miss manag want discuss apart everyth good would go back like say hakim help throughout speak realli good english member staff detail info need menu euro plu la cart starter euro main chicken euro king prawn dish lamb around euro room dessert comment person impress choic offer open price point menu serv bhaji chicken soup salad forgot th option main dhal dhamsak none common favour dish avail euro menu show lot promis bhaji samosa etc choos main ctm madra among other also get veg side dish menu along nan rice dessert coffe end none menu includ drink rice portion realli good euro plain euro pilau recent order nd portion rice mani restaur cut back portion size time order straight away realli hungri quit surpris deep pot rice deliv tabl much bring nearli whole portion home us nan bread love soft fluffi freshli cook got medium size bjaji love starter choic sauc amaz ok order lamb balti chicken bhuna chicken dish seem bigger come wide round curri dish lamb dish come bucket style pot fals base half way seem get smaller portion order lamb cost guess anyway curri nice lamb better option spice heat even though ask medium mention staff great took curri away make spicier upon return smile waiter said inenglish pleas tell waiter next time english make note chef make medium spice english curri suit coupl friend busi dont think get around easili pram flight stair loo,average review,3
