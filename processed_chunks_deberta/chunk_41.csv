Although my waist size has extended somewhat over that period I don't think La Valencia has changed much apart from the fact it's under different ownership.  Tapas wise it is quite limited, although we did have some delicious bright green olives and some raw, but cured tuna. The reason to come here however is not the food - it's the sherry. Now I know what you're thinking - Sherry, really? Yes really. The sherry here is absolutely wonderful and should certainly make you reappraise it as not being just an old lady's tipple.  This place is well worth tracking down. An authentic classic in a city who's identity is become more and more Americanised.

The atmosphere is friendly, the tapas simple but tasty (the cured tuna especially good) and the sherry sublime.

We asked to sit in a higher dining area with windows to the street but were ushered to another area only to see preferred guests being escorted upstairs. Not sure why!  The waiter was very pleasant but ameturish spilling drops of red wine onto the table clothe and around the glass. We were repeatedly told of the establishments prowess in that they bring all fresh ingredients from Italy but sometimes the motto of 'under promise and over deliver' is a better way to go rather than the other way round. My three companions meals were average to good and my Carbonara (an easy staple in most Italian Restaurants) was like eating glue. Once this was pointed out, the waiter agreed it was not to standard and offered a new entree but by that time it was too late as my guest had almost finished. A free desert was kindly offered and my meal was complimentary which was a nice touch. I am not sure how long they have been open but I suspect not long so in time I am sure they can iron out the kinks and try to match the food and service with their surroundings.

The waitress who served our table was in a constant rush bearing in mind there were only 3 tables taken in the whole place! Absolutely no table service skills what so ever.  Starters were warm and far to salty. My husband lasagne looked nothing like the pictures on here at all.... It was so dry, like it had been reheated several times that day and cold in middle (which of course we sent back).  Whilst we were waiting for the bill we overheard the waitress asking a table near to us if they wanted a small drink on the house, not once did she offer us which we thought was rather rude and strange. I could seriously go on and on about this place. Such a shame as we were looking forward to it.  Overall we lasted 1 hour and 5 minutes in there, I should imagine people have taken longer to eat in fast food Restaurants and paid a lot less.  I would recommend going for drinks at bar first to see what you think.

The bar itself is like stepping back in time and offers an authentic insight into 'old' Madrid. We arrived about 9pm and found ourselves a place at the bar (tables are available too).  Offering 5 types of sherry, we ended up staying rather longer than anticipated and sampled four of the five on offer. All were delicious, in their own right. Each glass was served with complimentary snacks (including the best olives), and you can order additional tapas-style small plates (meats, cheese, anchovies etc). Whilst not sufficient really for a whole meal (that's not the idea here) they were a delicious accompaniment to the sherry on offer. This place was an amazing experience and something I'd definitely recommend to get a real feel for Madrid and its history. It offers exceptional value, with each glass of sherry ranging between 1.90 - 2.20 euros, and most of the tapas dishes just a couple of euros each. Whilst sherry is the only drink on offer here so is obviously great for sherry lovers, it's also a great way for those who aren't as familiar with sherry to come and have a try - at only a couple of euros a glass it's an easy (and cheap) way to sample a selection.

One bartender said he didn't have any but he wrote the name and address of La Venencia on a paper napkin and called it the best sherry bar in Madrid. It looks like a working man's bar from 100 years ago, with barrels of sherry behind the bar. The walls have faded sherry posters and there's an old phone that doesn't work on the wall. There are only a few tables and most customers stand at the bar and talk to each other. I asked for two sherries one level sweeter than the very dry ""fino"". The bartender said they don't use the term ""mas dulce"" but rather ""menos seco."" He brought us two glasses of palo cortado and a plate of olives. The bill was 4 Euros 40.

The fare is typical for your standard Italian restaurant: basically pizza and pasta with some little extras. You can choose the type of pasta you want and then choose the best sauce to go with it. All combinations are possible. The quality, however, was fairly mediocre (other similar restaurants offer better consistently better food - the ""Tagliatelle"" chain, for example). Burrata was quite nice, the tortellini con carne with Amatriciana sauce was ok. No sparks though. The service tries extremely hard but generally gives an impression of total chaos rather than efficiency (the waiters seemed to spend at least the duration of our meal running around breathlessly), and coordination between staff was clearly not a strong point. Price: for a shared Burrata and a pasta combo each (5 people), water (no wine) and one desert, we paid just over 30 euros each. Expensive. Not bad.

Here at Piccolo Diavolo - don't be put off by exterior appearance. The young staff are immediately friendly and pleased to see you, and there's no shortage of attention throughout the meal. It's a small intimate place with no frills; nevertheless a bustling, pleasant atmosphere (plus music in the background). The menu is short but plenty of established favourites in the salad/pasta/carne categories; and when the food comes it is clear the kitchen knows its stuff (hence our second visit). We didn't try the pizzas, although we saw some excellent examples going to other tables. We ordered simple dishes, eg. A caprese salad and then a bolognese ragu were very satisfying, and just what was needed. The house wines are exceptionally good value in our view. So all in all we'd say excellent value indeed, in a friendly intimate atmosphere, and well worth a visit.",2015-10-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3438302-Reviews-or80-PICCOLO_DIAVOLO-Madrid.html,UID_34122,0.008,0.769,0.223,0.9922,0.2821969696969696,0.5230519480519479,0.381,1031,79,0.0766246362754607,0,32,False,37,0.1290322580645161,0.2096774193548387,0.2903225806451613,0.0483870967741935,0.1451612903225806,0.032258064516129,0.0161290322580645,0.0161290322580645,0.064516129032258,0.0483870967741935,176,134,4.863636363636363,0,0,wife ate twice day period madrid oct frequent tri italian cuisin countri itali never disappoint piccolo diavolo put exterior appear young staff immedi friendli pleas see shortag attent throughout meal small intim place frill nevertheless bustl pleasant atmospher plu music background menu short plenti establish favourit salad pasta carn categori food come clear kitchen know stuff henc second visit tri pizza although saw excel exampl go tabl order simpl dish eg capres salad bolognes ragu satisfi need hous wine except good valu view say excel valu inde friendli intim atmospher well worth visit,good review,4

They also have chicken and beef dishes and great pizza. We came in august and didn't even need a reservation, It was very quite and we hardly had to wait 3 minutes to be served our food. Then after the meal we were offered free lemon liqueur shots on the house! It was amazing quality and the prefect way to end the night.  The food was prefect, I couldn't say any thing wrong about it. But the service was even better! We ate there here two times. The first time we were served by this really friendly man. He was funny and chatty and was super welcoming! After our meal we had a great chat with him about Ireland and he told us about a local parade that was going on. He was so nice! We came back two days later and were served by the same guy. he remembered us and we chatted with him some more. He always had a smile on his face! When we left the chef actually came out to talk to us. You could see he really cared about his restaurant and his customers.  And the inside of the restaurant was fabulous! It was cozy and relaxing with soft lighting and lots of flawless decorations. They had nice music playing, which wasn't really to my taste but my mother liked it. Still, it added to a great atmosphere.  This restaurant is perfect for a date or even for families!

And there is nothing quite better than looping your way through the narrow streets off the Paseo de la Castellana/Paseo de Prado and having dinner in a Modern hip Italian/cocktail restaurant tucked a way between this grand path and the posh Calle Serrano. Italian you say? In Madrid? Yes, absolutely. I had a party of 5 in tow, adults and children of different ages and tastes. The staff was extraordinarily accomodating especially the head waiter/manager. The Woodfired Pizzas and homemade pastas are extarordinarily authentic as they import much of their ingredients from Italy. We tried the Siciian with divine anchovies and the Margarita Pizzas and they were so tasty and the crust was perfectly cooked. Cutting the pizza at the table was also a nice touch. We orded the gnocchi and its a must have as its fresh and like all their tomato based dishes, addicting. The drinks were super as cocktails are their thing and they were truly generous in serving us a wonderful starter/amuse bouche at the beginning and grappa at the end of the night.

The service - was a touch whimsical but fine on the whole. To explain - we were left alone to the point where we just starting to think we had been forgotten. And then the lady who ran front of house appeared. Explained the menu, took our order and then was spirited away.

This bar was frequented by republican and socialist supporters during the Franco fascist regime. They would meet here in secret to discuss politics. Franco's secret police would spy on them and take their photographs which led to dire consequences for the people involved. Hence why the proprietor requests customers not to take photos as a tribute to those customers back in those dark days who were spirited away by the fascist security services. Similarly, in tribute to republican socialism, the staff won't accept tips. Anyhow, the place? It's a fantastic place to visit for sherry and tapas. Manzanilla ice cold and delicious plump green olives. The bar staff chalk your bill on the counter in front of you, then you pay the final total when you leave.

By far, this location, is the one most I visited, it was the first stone of their success. By the way Tripadvisor staff, you need to update the address as the street has change the name. There are other gourmet burger spots in Madrid, but this one is my favorite ever. The Colmenares Gang knew from the very begginin the success formula, quality, quality and quality. And this is what they have been doing since they opened. The menu runs under the KISS rule, Keep It Simple Stupid. I was here once more last week to taste my favorite, Harlem Burger, this time 350grs, I have eaten a couple of times 500grs, but you need to be really hungry to cope with this.

I reserved a table at 8 p.m., and we were promptly seated by the owner, who offered menus in English or Spanish. After reviewing the wine list, and finding nothing I was familiar with, I asked for his assistance selecting a wine. He asked the style of our preference and confirmed that we wished to try a Spanish wine. He said that the wine I would like most (at a modest 22 Euros) was not listed on the menu, and he proceeded to bring us a bottle of chardonnay that was exactly the style we prefer. We ordered a variety of things (more than we needed), including an excellent foie gras with caramelized apples, a tender artichoke heart presented in the shape of a flower, truffled potato croquettes, Tomatoes Raf (an heirloom tomato salad, with sweet onions), luxuriously creamy rice with shrimp, and my daughter loved the Wagyu hamburger. Each dish was exceptional, and for the quality and quantity, we considered it a very good value (total bill was approximately 100 Euros for 3). We were the only non-locals in the tables area of the restaurant, and found the bar packed with Spanish speakers on the way out at 10:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night.

It's a great place to stop for lunch or dinner if you want to take a break from the bustle of the city center without having to leave it. The restaurant is owned by the chef and the head waiter, and they and the lovely waitress truly treat their clients like guests. The service is genuinely warm and remarkably attentive (but without any hovering!). And the food is fantastic.  The appetizers are homemade and delicious (it is my goal to sample all of them!),  the main dishes are simple and perfectly prepared--always very fresh and delicious with some quite healthy options,  and the desserts are not to be missed! I am particularly addicted to the homemade flan they serve with the lunch menu! All this in a quiet, cozy setting, 2 minutes from the Gran Vía. I've recently discovered that they do breakfast too! Great coffee! And the prices are really reasonable -- 10.80 Euros for the 3-course lunch menu, beverage included.  My husband and I had dinner there last night -- three courses (we split the appetizer), a lovely bottle of wine, coffees and an after-dinner drink for 50-something euros. La Luna 22 is one of those gorgeous places that is worth going back to again and again because of the excellent food and wonderful service.

A tour taking in a few of them will leave you wondering why you bother with any other barrio in the city - the general standard is that good. It will also leave you wanting to walk off some of the excesses you are likely to indulge in, which makes its location next to the Retiro very convenient.  The food and wine here at La Catapa, as previous reviewers indicate, of a high standard. There is a creative streak running through the tapas menu, in a similar vein to its predecessor, Laredo. The wine list is excellent and you can enjoy a good Spanish wine for a very reasonable price. Service is very friendly and helpful.  Only one quibble - since taking over these premises from Taberna Laredo (must be a couple of years ago?), the owners have failed to really create a strong identity for La Catapa - the bar still looks as though Laredo has just moved out and these guys have moved in, plonking down some trays of food on the counters. It all lacks the panache and energy of Laredo, and fails to deliver the same sort of excitement. It's pleasant enough... just a little too anodyne for my taste. I think the place could use a vibrant, energetic barman or two and the owners should zing up its rather tired decor. Change the colour scheme and fill in some of the large spaces left behind the bar when Laredo moved on - just make it their own space. At the moment, everything says this is a temporary stop-over on the way to somewhere else. La Catapa isn't yet an essential stop when I'm in the area. It has a lot of very strong local competition and they need to do a bit more to match the buzz you experience when you visit some of their neighbours. But if you fancy a quiet evening, enjoying some great tapas and wine, served by people who care about your satisfaction, you could do a lot worse than to spend your money here.",2013-09-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1929385-Reviews-or50-Taberna_La_Catapa-Madrid.html,UID_581,0.039,0.826,0.134,0.9872,0.1676384479717812,0.4867583774250441,0.328725,1919,184,0.09588327253778,0,44,False,60,0.1333333333333333,0.1666666666666666,0.2777777777777778,0.0888888888888888,0.1555555555555555,0.0111111111111111,0.0,0.0222222222222222,0.0888888888888888,0.0555555555555555,360,222,4.3277777777777775,0,0,la catapa one grow number good tapa bar restaur area tour take leav wonder bother barrio citi gener standard good also leav want walk excess like indulg make locat next retiro conveni food wine la catapa previou review indic high standard creativ streak run tapa menu similar vein predecessor laredo wine list excel enjoy good spanish wine reason price servic friendli help one quibbl sinc take premis taberna laredo must coupl year ago owner fail realli creat strong ident la catapa bar still look though laredo move guy move plonk tray food counter lack panach energi laredo fail deliv sort excit pleasant enough littl anodyn tast think place could use vibrant energet barman two owner zing rather tire decor chang colour scheme fill larg space left behind bar laredo move make space moment everyth say temporari stop way somewher els la catapa yet essenti stop area lot strong local competit need bit match buzz experi visit neighbour fanci quiet even enjoy great tapa wine serv peopl care satisfact could lot wors spend money,bad review,2

I am the chef-owner of the Barcelona Tapas in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I have no previous relationship with the chef or owner of this restaurant. I normal do not right review but I feel that this one deserves it. I recommend that you try this off the non tourist restaurant for true local flavor by an experienced hard working young local chef. I was very fortunate to have found this place due to a wine sales woman that I met while shopping. Since she is from Madrid and sells wines to many restaurants she turned me on to ¨Catapa¨. We drank a very smooth well rounded wine called Pujanza 2008 for 25 euros and a great value for a reasonable price. We ordered two kinds of ¨croquetas¨ which are fried, one made with cured spanish ham and the other with natural truffle. Both are top notch but my favorite were the truffle croquetas. The salads were wonderful and I repeated the quail salad twice. The bread was very interesting which was a combination of a country style bread and rye mixed together and very tasty. They offer local fresh tapas of seafood and beef which were top quality and large portions. We an aged ¨chuleton¨which is aged beef bone on ribeye of the highes quality and was big enough for 3 people. It was 68 euros but worth the price for the quality and preparation. I would like to go back to this place and try all the dishes.

This review focuses on the cuisine. We are “foodies” and enjoy the total experience of great food, presentation and service. While recently in Madrid, we made our way to Taberna Laredo. Unfortunately, without reservations, we were out of luck; it was full. As tourists we didn’t know the neighborhood, so we asked the waiter for a recommendation. His recommendation was right across the street, called Taberna La Catapa. We had a lovely evening and dining experience. The menu was only in Spanish, so the chef-owner came to our table and discussed the entire menu with us. He made recommendations, and having just come from Barcelona, we decided to think out-of-the box and try new things. The dishes were fabulous, and the presentations were excellent. My husband went for the razor clams, in season and he loved them. I had the oxtail stew; it was marvelous just like great comfort food should be. Our cousin had what the chef called his grandma’s recipe, which was rice with squid in black ink. The dish was one of the best I have ever tasted. The white rice was placed on the plate as a round mold surrounded by thick black ink with the squid – it was awesome! Words can’t express how delicious this dish was. The owner came after dinner to talk with us, and we learned the restaurant just opened six months ago and it’s his first. It is very small, but lovely: a small tapas bar upstairs and a few tables downstairs, all contemporary and harmonious. When in Madrid, we will definitely come here again. The experience was wonderful and contributed to our experience of a lovely stay in Spain. If in Madrid, go here for a warm, lovely and delicious meal. Taberna La Catapa, located on Calle Menorca, 19 Madrid. Telephone number 686.14.38.23. The owner is Miguel Angel Jimenez Garcia, a lovely person.

We did not have a reservation the first night, but we were warmly welcomed and a table was found after we had an enjoyed a glass of wine at the busy bar. Both nights we were given a small tapa to share--a delicious eggplant the first night and an olive dish the second night. Each course was freshly made and brought to our table as it is prepared in the kitchen. They prepare the burrata, tomato and arugula salad at the table, which was my personal favorite. My 10 year old daughter ate the hamburger entree twice...not an ordinary hamburger...but one prepared with sauteed onions, cheese, pesto, on an incredibly delicious bread. Our seafood was fresh and the cheese plate spectacular. You can purchase wines by the bottle or glass, and they also have beer.

We have thoroughly enjoyed every occasion. We find the menu and the ""daily specials"" varied and interesting, the wine list seems to us to offer a range of wines likely to suit most tastes and pockets and the service is welcoming, friendly and professional.  We feel that the chef/proprietor takes a real pride in the quality of produce used, the manner in which it is cooked and the way it is presented. Taberna La Catapa is not a cheap restaurant but to us it is not expensive for what it offers - we always come away pleased that we have received value for money.

The owner is a wonderful person and since coming back to the US, keep seeing both this place and his name featured on awards and lists of the best places to eat and drink in the city.

The restaurant is apparently quite popular as it messaged me to confirm our booking on the day. It is located on a quiet side street and is about 5 mins walk from the Ibiza metro station in a safe neighbourhood. On a Tuesday evening the tapas bar in the front of the restaurant was lively, and the dining room at the back was full. Reservation is necessary. Decor of the dining area is simple. There were only a few tables, No English menus. The serving ladies were friendly but did not speak much English, but the gentleman from the tapas bar came and helped us out with the menu. Very kind. Food was not bad. We had octopus salad and razor clams as appetisers, pork and seafood omelette for main course. Dinner for the two of us cost Euro 70 including one cocktail.

I highly recommend making reservations here because there aren't too many tables available and a ton of people are standing to eat and drink wine there for hours because it is such a great place. All the food I had was great, fresh, and executed well.  The customer service was very good. There were two female waitresses who served me and they were fantastic. One thing my boss taught me and others to have at our workplace is something called a ""can do attitude."" That means that even though something is difficult we don't say ""oh no we can't do that. Oh that's against the rules."" Instead we say ""Yes we can do it. let us find a way to accomplish this"" This mentality of a can do attitude is exactly what the waitresses have here. This place is not a tourist trap and serves mostly the locals. Therefore the menu is in all Spanish and the waitresses don't speak much English. However, they worked very hard to communicate with me and try to get me exactly what I wanted. They checked on us throughout the entire evening even though everyone in that restaurant was stuffed in there like sardines. They were extremely polite and made sure we got everything we needed to be comfortable. I was very tired from a long day of walking and even though I didn't make reservations and therefore couldn't sit at one of the chairs, the waitress noticed I was tired and tried her best to tell me that I can sit there because the next reservation isn't a full party so they won't be needing it. I really appreciated that because my back was hurting and my feet were aching. Tip: Make reservations ahead of time. Ask your hotel to speak with them in spanish to do so. Use google translate to translate the menu (you can select the camera function to view the menu in real time and it translates it while you are hovering your phone over the menu). Also eat the truffle croquettes they are the best! I applaud this place for great local dishes and fantastic customer service.",2017-12-31,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1929385-Reviews-or10-Taberna_La_Catapa-Madrid.html,UID_34239,0.044,0.797,0.159,0.9938,0.2540509259259259,0.5004089506172841,0.278047619047619,1993,182,0.0913196186653286,1,44,False,84,0.1052631578947368,0.0789473684210526,0.3947368421052631,0.0263157894736842,0.1578947368421052,0.0263157894736842,0.0,0.0526315789473684,0.1052631578947368,0.0526315789473684,363,218,4.490358126721763,0,0,awesom experi highli recommend make reserv mani tabl avail ton peopl stand eat drink wine hour great place food great fresh execut well custom servic good two femal waitress serv fantast one thing boss taught other workplac someth call attitud mean even though someth difficult say oh oh rule instead say ye let us find way accomplish mental attitud exactli waitress place tourist trap serv mostli local therefor menu spanish waitress speak much english howev work hard commun tri get exactli want check us throughout entir even even though everyon restaur stuf like sardin extrem polit made sure got everyth need comfort tire long day walk even though make reserv therefor sit one chair waitress notic tire tri best tell sit next reserv full parti need realli appreci back hurt feet ach tip make reserv ahead time ask hotel speak spanish use googl translat translat menu select camera function view menu real time translat hover phone menu also eat truffl croquett best applaud place great local dish fantast custom servic,very good review,5

You can choose different sizes for your burger (160 gr, 250 gr, 350 gr, and the only-for-some 500 gr). Regardless of the ingredients or side orders you choose, price depends only from the size of the burger, ranging from 7 to 15€ aprox. The meat was absolutely delicious and cooked precisely as we have ordered. The restaurant has a nice american feel, on the down side I'd only point out the fact that most of the tables are on the basement level, which is a bit too isolated for my taste, and that they do not serve coffee or tea. I found that a bit surprising! I noticed that they are very attentive with families with children: they provide some colour pencils and paper games, keeping them entertained and quiet, which makes everyone happy. A meal for 2 (2 burgers of 160 and 350 gr, 2 sparkling waters and a glass of whine) costed us 26€.

Yes, you're seated but the ambient is different; it makes you wait for good food. There are no memorabilia of musicians nor actors, nor a worn 50's look. Representing modern New York? (Can't say, never been to New York) :-) There is a risk that you get seated in the basement, but that should not be a showstopper. The basement has the same deco as the street level. Ambient is nice and calm, the service nice and courteous. One will have to wait for being seated, and will have to wait a little to get served, and a little to get the food. This is not about fast food, but not slow food either.  The menu of burgers is long enough, and quite creative. The client has to make selections. The size of the beef patty (160-500g), type of bread (or leave it out), potatoes or coleslaw... But wow, the burgers and fries are great! The price is of course more than in McD, but it is at the level of a lunch menu in Madrid.

I didn't find anywhere else in Madrid quite like it - shabby but incredibly charming. A sign indicates that patrons shouldn't take photos, making for an even more enjoyable visit in our instagram-craycray-era, but the rule actually originates from the 1930s and was put in place to protect Republicans from being incriminated by possible Fascist spies during the war. There were only locals in the bar with us - most people came in alone and were clearly regulars - all very welcoming and friendly though. The staff weren't sure how we'd found out about the place - I explained that I love sherry and enjoy it in a number of places in London, most of which he knew of and had visited in a previous trip to the city. There is a small tapas menu - perfect with the delicious drinks but not enough for your main meal of the day. Cheese and cured meats, etc. (NB I didn't like the dried tuna/fish roe, but locals seemed to be really keen) Tabs are written onto the wooden bar top with chalk, to be totted up when you want to leave (don't expect that to be any time soon - you'll love it too much). Tips aren't accepted - they will gracefully return them to you when you try to leave them! This rule also originates from it's Republican-sympathising roots. Wonderful place.

The experience was marred only by a rosebud-seller who went from table to table, seemingly with management's approval, based on how I saw the personnel greet him.

The owner and staff were not effusively welcoming, but it's not that type of place. We found them to be reserved but perfectly pleasant.

A mix of locals and tourists. Incredibly atmospheric, and a real step back in time. The equivalent English pub would be something like the Hare and Hounds in Shudehill, Manchester.

The staff is friendly (at least one girl was Italian), appetizers are 100% Italian (oh, that Mortadelia!), and the food is good. Waiting time is average, Thin home-made pizzas y good quality pasta, everything was tasty and I would not mind going there again soon. We ate at the lower floor, there is an upper floor with a bar that is perfect for Italian Coffee or after-lunch drinks (good selection of fine brands). The restroom was the cleanest I have seen in years.  I would just point out 2 negative points: the seats on the lower floor might be comfortable or not, not all the chairs are the same, I saw flat wooden chairs and on the other side, ultra-cool armchairs. I took one of those and it was heaven! :) Also, the ambience music that is chosen is weird, I could hear twice the CD ""Bossa and Stones"", an awful selection of talentless whispered vocals on soft arrangements of Rolling Stones' classic tracks, so I guess the CD was on ""repeat"" mode. Trying to look cool and trendy? That wasn't working. The gorgeous 50s and 60s actresses posters displayed on the walls and the tasty food are clearly suggesting both something that is European and music from that era. There is plenty of music I can think of that would have been better. Sorry for that, but I can't give you the 5th star. Don' like my review and want to avoid criticism about music? Just don't have any music during lunch :)",2015-12-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7895442-Reviews-or210-Flavia_Restaurant_Bar-Madrid.html,UID_31793,0.093,0.728,0.179,0.9859,0.1507965686274509,0.5056372549019609,0.5005133333333334,1534,129,0.0840938722294654,2,55,False,42,0.0952380952380952,0.1904761904761904,0.2738095238095238,0.0595238095238095,0.1071428571428571,0.0238095238095238,0.0238095238095238,0.0238095238095238,0.0833333333333333,0.119047619047619,281,187,4.459074733096085,0,0,group friend book tabl xma celebr last week know place pleas begin staff friendli least one girl italian appet italian oh mortadelia food good wait time averag thin home made pizza good qualiti pasta everyth tasti would mind go soon ate lower floor upper floor bar perfect italian coffe lunch drink good select fine brand restroom cleanest seen year would point neg point seat lower floor might comfort chair saw flat wooden chair side ultra cool armchair took one heaven also ambienc music chosen weird could hear twice cd bossa stone aw select talentless whisper vocal soft arrang roll stone classic track guess cd repeat mode tri look cool trendi work gorgeou actress poster display wall tasti food clearli suggest someth european music era plenti music think would better sorri give th star like review want avoid critic music music lunch,bad review,2

From a lack lustre location they have somehow created a restaurant that feels authentic and rooted. One of the waiters told me that they have been going for 41 years and 11 at the current location - and the pedigree shows. If you are looking for more elegant “Argentinian inspired” dining then this is not for you, but if you want small wine glasses, checkered table cloths and a traditional menu then look no further.

La Venencia isn’t a place to drink wine. It’s a place to drink Sherry wines. Don’t ask for a bier, a coke or even a rioja wine. Ask for a manzanilla, ask for a palo cortao or ask for an amontillado or even an oloroso. And ask for any of the few tapas, but remember, they are offered only as a way to avoid getting drunk too soon! And enjoy it peacefully, while you are trying to guess when it was the last time the walls where painted, when was the last time the old bottles were dusted.  And enjoy having a wonderful wine in a place that hasn’t changed by decades, a place that is as it was, a preserved place of other ages. And my last (and maybe better) advice: take some minutes before your visit reading on the Wikipedia about what a “venencia” is - don't mix up venencia with Venecia - and about “Sherry” wines.

We began with Salmorejo – certainly the best we’ve had while visiting Spain! I could have made a meal with more of this delicious cold soup! But more amazing flavors were coming! The Tomate dulce, which was a surprising blend of flavors and textures, could easily have been our dessert. Next we shared the Tataki de salmon and the Coca de sardine ahumada.

It is easy to walk right past it, as it doesn't stick from the other stores and restaurants on the street.  I first looked at the menu and saw the lunch special priced at 10 Euro, plus a vino and dessert. Although the menu I had was only in Spanish, it was easy to make out and had 6 entradas and the same number of second dishes.  The waiter was quick, pleasant and efficient and I was soon off to tasting my pork egg roll and then later, my second dish of noodles/vegetables and chicken. Everything was very tasty with just the right amount of spices. At the end, I was offered coffee or a desert and chose the apple pie. It was served chilled with some fresh whipped cream.

Although we asked for medium rare, they always seem to cook the beef more in Europe. Regardless, the spicing and flavors were excellent.

The restaurant being empty, we didn't it would be of any problem. Not sure if they understood us as they kept bugging us every 5 minutes. Anyway, about the food: Do not order the paella. Just don't.  The rice was still half raw, it crunched as you bit into it and got stuck between the teeth. Having eaten some amazing paella couple days ago, this was just dreadful.  Worst part was when we mentioned about the raw rice, the waiter first just by looking told us that it's fine. After a while of us not eating the food he came back and asked to take a taste. With a shrug he said ""it's ok"". Even our Spanish friend laughed when she saw the picture (the rice looks raw even in it!).

We chose the Menu del dia €13 each and were blown away by how good the food was. We both went for a type of Fish stew to start, followed by massive gambas for me and my partner had the pork steak.

My wife chose the grilled king prawns and a tapas of peppers with tuna. I decided to try the pulpo (octopus). We ordered wine by the glass and were served free tapas whilst our food was prepared. The food arrived in good time and was very well presented.  The king prawns were enormous, plentiful and delicious (if a bit messy to de-shell). I’d tried octopus before whilst on holiday in Greece and was disappointed. This was much better - well cooked, tender and tasty. At the end of our meal we were given a free glass of wine each, which was a nice gesture. The staff weren’t great English speaking, but were helpful and friendly. Although I’ve awarded 5 stars, we noticed that the frescos could do with a bit of attention as some of them are peeling off the wall. However, this didn’t spoil our night at all.

He recommended El Pimiento Verde, a Basque restaurant, as having ""the best artichokes in the world"". He told me that the restaurant grows them themselves, so they are available fresh year-round. They have also devised a way of making the inner leaves around the heart fully edible, so they are very easy to eat.  Anyway, we went there on our first evening in the city, and were so impressed that we went two more times.  We had the artichoke ""flowers"" at every dinner. They are really delicious: simply prepared, and extremely tender without being overcooked. Though a full order has five artichoke flowers, you can also order them individually, if you prefer a smaller portion.  Other highlights among the first courses included Pimientos de Gureníca, small, non-spicy green peppers, simply grilled and served with olive oil and sea salt, and Morcilla (black pudding) formed into little fried cakes with cheese and potatoes.  Superb main courses included Chuletón (grilled beef entrecôte) and a grilled hake fillet with a squid ink sauce topped with grilled baby eels. Also a wonderful Arroz Marinero - a soupy, tomato-based rice dish with fish and seafood.  Excellent wines by the glass and by the bottle. Portions are generous, so I have no idea how good the desserts are! I expect they are delicious too.  This is a friendly, welcoming, non-pretentious restaurant, serving truly outstanding Basque food at very reasonable prices. I would go there for a fourth time today, but, alas, I'm no longer in Madrid.

Anyway, I'm so glad we did. The staff at this restaurant were lovely, so helpful and when there was a slight misunderstanding over an order (probably as much our fault as their's) they corrected it without question. The recommendations from the waiter were gratefully received and proved to be well advised. My wife had a T Bone steak and was presented with what was possibly the largest I had ever seen - although there was a fair amount of fat and some gristle but that is to be expected with that cut. I had the Zamburinas (I think!), anyway they were baby scallops in their shells and were the sweetest scallops I have ever had, although a little less sea salt wouldn't have hurt. To drink we had a wonderful Sangria and were given a complimentary small carafe of their equivalent of Baileys - enough for at least two glasses each - it was lovely. The size of the main courses meant we had no room for a sweet, maybe next time.",2016-07-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2707751-Reviews-or70-Cantina_La_Traviesa-Madrid.html,UID_34506,0.051,0.797,0.152,0.9767,0.0914682539682539,0.5436507936507937,0.5291375,1128,104,0.0921985815602836,1,28,False,32,0.1186440677966101,0.135593220338983,0.2203389830508474,0.0847457627118644,0.1016949152542373,0.0508474576271186,0.0338983050847457,0.0338983050847457,0.1186440677966101,0.1016949152542373,205,140,4.507317073170731,0,0,call restaur walk anoth one round corner without eat receiv rude arrog recept manag name escap afraid anyway glad staff restaur love help slight misunderstand order probabl much fault correct without question recommend waiter grate receiv prove well advis wife bone steak present possibl largest ever seen although fair amount fat gristl expect cut zamburina think anyway babi scallop shell sweetest scallop ever although littl less sea salt hurt drink wonder sangria given complimentari small caraf equival bailey enough least two glass love size main cours meant room sweet mayb next time,good review,4

We took her advice and walked a short way to El Pimiento Verde. What a find. We shared 3 dishes, each one superb. We began with their famous artichokes done in olive oil. They were tender and you eat the whole pieces. They were whittled down to the most tender inner petals and heart. Next we had the baby green peppers, grilled in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt flakes. These were the real thing and they were scrumptious. Finally, we had the creamy mushroom rice with shrimp. This was one of the best risotto's we have ever eaten. It was crunchy and just creamy enough. Our servers, Joy and Julia, were attentive and knew their job.

We were seated on the pavement area which is exactly what we wanted as the atmosphere was terrific. Although the restaurant was very busy, we were looked after with great attention and not rushed in any way. The food was delicious and served in large measures, my entrecote must have been 14oz! and cooked perfectly.

So being in Madrid with my family now I just had to come back here...and how they enjoyed it... In fact we came 3 times; for lunch & dinner. To us, having lunch or dinner is more than just eating, and that's what you experience in 'Venta El Buscon'. The atmosphere is great -especially at night- and soon you'll feel like a local. The waiters may be very busy at times but seeing the joy and the laughter in how they deal with it, makes it even better. Food and quality are just like preferences for colors, so discussions can be endless. We like it because of the reasons already mentioned, but certainly and not in the least because the food is great, certainly for the price you pay!!! If I could find anything similar in Belgium, I would pay even 50% more, with pleasure... To be honest, prices in Madrid are moderate and could easily beat lots of the popular cities throughout Europe... This said, we should all keep in mind what we got and what we payed for it.

Expect very tasty food-- though nothing blew us away as an amazing dish, you will not leave hungry! The staff is also extremely welcoming and friendly and speaks some English. The place was very lively both times we went and is festively decorated. First, we were pleasantly surprised to find that both bread and an appetizer (the first time at dinner it was shrimp, the second time at lunch chorizo) were free-- everywhere else we went in Andalucia charged a nominal fee for bread, so it was a pleasant surprise. For dinner we had the meat platter and the grilled vegetable platter. Both were enormous. The meats were very good, though not amazing (except for the chorizo, which was awesome!). We expected the grilled vegetables to be great after reading another review, but they were just plain old veggies. That said, we still left happy because of the good value, paying 25€ for all that food plus a bottle of sparkling water. For lunch we had the goat cheese (awesome), the black pudding (very good, but know what you are eating... or don't like was my case, haha), and the paella (good, not the very best we had on the trip).

However, upon getting there, we found the place closed -probably because of refurbishment. It had just started raining, so upon turning the street we decided to go into the first place we liked the look of -this happened to be Venta El Buscón. Were we lucky? Oh, yes! Wonderful atmosphere, simple and nice, fast and cordial service, simple yet delicious food. We had the garlic prawns in the over, along with the succulent fried calamari, the fried fish platter and a nice salad. We were about to order some more things, but the nice waiter said this was way too much for two people -and he was right! The portions are more than satisfactory. Despite having a dinner with fish and seafood, we opted for Rioja. The calamari we had in La Bardemcilla de Santa Ana round the corner a couple of days ago was like plastic and arrived when we were about to ask for the bill. Here the calamari was springy with a light batter and reminded us of good -rare find- Greek seafood. The aioli garlicky mix of the prawns had just the needed hint of chilli and the fried fish/seafood platter was excellent as main. These were more than enough for two people. We are in Madrid only for a few days, but we shall definitely be visiting again. Thank you to both of the wonderful waiters for great service!

We started with artichokes- amazing. I don't know how they got them so tender, but they were delicious and unlike anything I've had before. We then had a few fish courses- the squid ink croquettes were a novel and delicious dish and a calamari in caramelized onion that was almost perfect- tender and sweet, a nice departure from the usual fried.

We liked this place so much we ate here twice in one week. The first time we had the grilled meat platter and a grilled veggie platter. The meat platter was as good as another review says, but it was the veggies that brought us back. In some ways, spanish cooking doesn't know what to do with veggies, so it was great to find a dish in which a variety of fresh, simply grilled vegetables were featured. The second time, we added the gambas al ajillo. OMG, so good I had to get the recipe. We soaked up every last bit of the sauce with crusty bread - my toddler asks for this dish all the time. The service is fast and good, and our servers were genuinely friendly and fun. The place is crowded in a bustling, friendly way. It's good for kids because the noise level means your kids can relax a bit, but it's not a ""kid's place"" per se because the tables are tight and there is drinking and smoking.",2011-08-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d990632-Reviews-or360-Venta_El_Buscon-Madrid.html,UID_34552,0.014,0.773,0.213,0.9935,0.3510714285714286,0.4246428571428572,0.3685583333333333,1037,101,0.0973963355834136,0,29,False,49,0.2,0.18,0.24,0.08,0.18,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.08,0.02,199,133,4.21608040201005,0,0,mistakenli ate intend eat place friend recommend delici mistak place recommend like place much ate twice one week first time grill meat platter grill veggi platter meat platter good anoth review say veggi brought us back way spanish cook know veggi great find dish varieti fresh simpli grill veget featur second time ad gamba al ajillo omg good get recip soak everi last bit sauc crusti bread toddler ask dish time servic fast good server genuin friendli fun place crowd bustl friendli way good kid nois level mean kid relax bit kid place per se tabl tight drink smoke,good review,4

I am not in a position to determine whether the food is authentic or not, as I have never been to Korea, however I do wish it was more spicy. We happen to love spice, but you have to keep in mind this is difficult for a restaurant in Spain as the general Spanish public has a very low tolerance to spice and they would get loads of complaints.

Here is what I think of this place. Keep in mind, I was born & grow up in Korea. 1. It is just shame u call this place a Korean restaurant who serves Korean food. In my life, I never had a Korean restaurant charges banchan!!! All those side dishes are supposedly free! They are charging kimchi 5 euros!  2. After talking to the waiter, they gave me kimchi & seasoned tofu as a service. So I can say their service was good. The waiter wasn't Korean but speak Korean well. 3. I ordered spicy squid with noodle & my friend ordered kimchi jigae (kimchi tofu soup), tinto de verano. Spicy squid tasted like Chinese food & they used linguini noodles! No Korean spicy squid dish uses linguini noodles!!! Definitely not taste like Chinese! I had to ask go-choojang(red pepper paste) & crushed red pepper to make it spicier. Btw, I did tell them make mine really spicy... My friend's kimchi soup was better than I thought but not worth more than €13!  4. Fee kimchi... Way too old & I am so glad they gave to us for free. Otherwise after I paid €5 for that old stinky kimchi, I would been screaming.  5. I got the bill, over €33 for our lunch. They charged €4.5 for the drink, €2.5for rice. I mean what kind of Korean restaurant charges a bowl of rice when u order kimchi soup????  The waiter said that is what they do in Spain. So here is my thought...  U r in Spain. Eat Spanish dish when u r in Spain. Try authentic Spanish dish. Korean food can wait until when u go back home.

We noticed it was packed and there were wine glasses in everyone's hands and decided this was a place for us to try, at least for a drink. We started at the bar and found the house red to be outstanding. We were served some iberico ham and manchego and stood at the bar observing the crowd. Plates of wonderful food came out to those seated and behind the bar one of the owners was slicing away at the ham. We had three glasses standing at the crowded bar when the other owner came over and insisted we sit down at a table, just to be more comfortable. I am so glad he did! We ordered a full platter of the ham and cheese we were served at the bar and decided to try the house specialty, the cod. It was prepared in a sauce that was simply outstanding! We had some grilled vegetables that were done to perfection and finished off our meal with some wonderful house made creme caramel liquor. There was live entertainment and the owners treated us like we were regulars. They urged us to come back the following night to eat with them and took photographs with us.

However, following a nice cheese plate and some nice wine (that was suggested by our waiter), the humongous paella arrived. Suggested for two people but it could easily have been enough for 3.

We ate there twice during our stay in Madrid (very rare for us).  It's lively and friendly. The food was good, servings were huge. We loved the grilled vegetable plate, but weren't crazy about the shrimp toast. We met several tourists there from France, Spain and the UK. It doesn't have a touristy feel.  The best thing it has is a server named Sebastian. This guy was incredible. We loved watching him work. He welcomed everyone who walked in with a big loud ""Buenos"" and then literally ran around the restaurant taking care of seemingly everyone and everything. The entire time he was working at an incredible pace, he was smiling, laughing and interacting with everyone around.

Having walked along Calle Cava Baja and found nothing of interest, I stumbled upon this restaurant. I was so impressed with the friendliness and food at this restaurant that i actually ate here for both nights in Madrid. The jovial waiter standing by the restaurant door way made a friendly comment and we started chatting. I had a look at the menu and asked him for a table for 2. The restaurant was full (manly locals with only about 8 tables) and the waiter asked me to wait 10 minutes at the bar (with a free drink) and then he would have a table for me and my wife.  The menu was extensive and very reasonably priced and had some dishes that I had not seen before. The food was delicious and all the waiters were very friendly and treated us as if we were long standing customers/friends. I can recommend the whole squid Euro 14 (stuffed with cod and vegetables), the ox tail stew Euro 13, very large plate of iberico ham Euro 15, large garlic prawns Euro 14 and the Razor Clams Euro 13 . The bottle of wine i chose Euro 20 was out of stock and the waiter was very apologetic and allowed me to have another more expensive bottle Euro 25 at the same price! The owner came around during the meal and made sure all was ok. At the end of the meal, a bottle of their locally produced liquer was placed on the table as a thank you......i was allowed to take as much as i liked for free! The second night was even better and the owner and waiters recognised us and treated us as royalty for the night. This restuarant does have a large following of locals and i would suggest you get to the restaurant by 8.30pm to ensure you get a table.",2014-09-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2707751-Reviews-or120-Cantina_La_Traviesa-Madrid.html,UID_34648,0.007,0.876,0.117,0.9903,0.2867729591836734,0.5229109977324263,0.5248,1760,161,0.0914772727272727,2,35,False,82,0.1,0.2,0.45,0.0,0.225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,337,189,4.2195845697329375,0,0,spend day travel around spain mostli eat tapa end tour madrid day night walk along call cava baja found noth interest stumbl upon restaur impress friendli food restaur actual ate night madrid jovial waiter stand restaur door way made friendli comment start chat look menu ask tabl restaur full manli local tabl waiter ask wait minut bar free drink would tabl wife menu extens reason price dish seen food delici waiter friendli treat us long stand custom friend recommend whole squid euro stuf cod veget ox tail stew euro larg plate iberico ham euro larg garlic prawn euro razor clam euro bottl wine chose euro stock waiter apologet allow anoth expens bottl euro price owner came around meal made sure ok end meal bottl local produc liquer place tabl thank allow take much like free second night even better owner waiter recognis us treat us royalti night restuar larg follow local would suggest get restaur pm ensur get tabl,good review,4

I saw very good reviews so I decided to give it a shot. We were welcomed by a very cheerful Spanish man who have made us feel at home. After seeing the menu which is really Spanish food we have decided to go with things we don't eat everyday. Drinks we decided to try their sangria and the waiter quickly went to the bar and brought a small glass of sangria as sample to Try and obviously it was perfect. My kids choosed the tripe and cod they were amazing. My wife took shrimps in garlic, mother in law some anchovies and I took the bulls tail ........omg the bulls tail..just wow. As desert we took a mixed plate and everything was very good. He brought us as well some liquor similar to baileys which he said they make it themselves. That liquor made my wife very happy.

We had just eaten at San Miguel Market, and were strolling back to Lavapies, when I spotted a handsome older gentleman with a brilliant 'tache hanging outside a tapas bar. He caught my eye and shouted 'Hola!' and waved us over. We went over to speak to him, he in Spanish, my boyfriend didnt understand a word, and I myself with a basic grip of the language! But pretty soon the three of us were laughing, gesturing, loosely trying to translate each other etc, through a basic school knowledge of spanish we learnt that this man, Lolo, was the father of the owner of Cantina La Traviesa, and a pretty big cheese of the local area! He let us try their jamon (delicious!) and then to thank him, i tried to buy him a drink, of course this elderly gentleman wouldn't hear of taking money from us and instead bought US drinks instead!  So there we were, laughing and drinking beer on the street with this lovely old guy, when his son (the owner) came out to see what was going on!! Soon he was telling us that Lolo was a Karate champion of 40 years, I translated this to my boyfriend who is a jujitsu instructor, who then immediately started calling him Sensei and then they were mock-fighting in the street, Lolo taking his jacket off and putting up his dukes XD  They are a lovely lovely family, we met the owners wife too, after they closed up the shop Lolo took us over the road to a cuban Jazz cafe (i think it was called the something-negra...) where everyone knew him. There we were bought beer, shots of grappa, and mojitos, it was unbelievable hospitality with a simple lesson that now we must do the same and pass this generosity forward in our own country! Lolo said that he simply enjoys chatting to people, and that tourists don't like to talk as much as he'd hoped, so if you're here, please go visit this place and have some of their delicious jamon! And chat to them!

Unfortunately, for us it was not as good. We went for lunch and ordered some soft drinks and three tapas, the ham croquettes, patatas bravas and beef meatballs. There was some struggle with language (our fault that we don't speak more spanish) but we pointed out all three items on the menu in the end and we thought we had got our point across. When the food came out, instead of the ham croquettes we were brought ham, egg and chips. The patatas bravas, which on the menu said came with two sauces, only came with the salsa sauce and the meatballs came out 10mins after everything else, in a gravy sauce with chips in it. So we ended up with potatoes, meatball and potatoes and ham, egg and potatoes, despite only ordering one lot of potatoes! Instead of complaining about the ham egg and chips we did our best to get on with it and just eat the ham and leave the rest. When we had finished the same waiter refused to take our plates twice because we hadnt eatent the egg and chips, so unfortunately we ended up having to tell him the order had been wrong. He was very apologetic and brought out two croquettes which were actually very nice. Food quality wise wasn't as good as other restaurants, the meatballs were tasteless and the patatas bravas were not as good as the restaurant round the corner, it was also more expensive than the place round the corner, where in our opinion, the food is better,however compared to other places in madrid it was cheap.

Unlike most places where people are sitting around talking... Here you will find people mostly eating, smiling and enjoying.  I had the monk fish which he advised was a very large portion and needn't be shared with further dishes. He fried half for me and grilled the other half to perfection with garlic paprika and aioli.  The bread served on arrival is delicious.

The food was deliciously prepared, the wine excellent, and the servers and owner, Caesar, were all so very attentive. We sampled four appetizers and two entrees which was more than enough food! All the food was fresh and tasty, prepared with interesting cheeses and flavors. Enjoying the dinner so much, we decided to return two nights later with a party of 17 people. It was a different experience and we encountered a bit of a language barrier because our group spoke French and English only. Because our group was so large, Caesar explained that it would be best if our whole party ordered tapas only. He explained that if we all ordered entrees, that not all the food would come out together. This was a bit disappointing, but, we understood that the kitchen could not accomodate preparing and serving 17 dinners simulataneously. In retrospect, I feel our group was too large for this lovely little place, and, we are much appreciative to Caesar and his employees for doing their best to make our evening special. I would definitely recommend making reservations, dining earlier rather than later, and keeping your party to a maximum of 6 persons. Definitely visit this restaurant when you are in Madrid.

My son enjoyed the lobster dish. The house wine offerings were very good, and reasonably priced. We were very impressed with the artichoke “flowers” as our main appetizer. Our only regret was not asking for lemon to cut the coarsely-ground sea salt, which was applied a little too heavily. We would definitely return on a visit back to this area. It’s a very good value for the price. We made a reservation, but it wasn't necessary because we are ""early"" diners by Spaniard standards. If you go before 8:30 you probably don't need one.

From the outside it looks unimpressive, located in a strip of storefront businesses with only a small exposure to the street. Inside it is a bit narrow but well decorated and inviting. All in all it is still about the food! We arrived without a reservation having failed to navigate their website from a mobile device. After a bit of pleading they were able to seat us.

Flavia on the other hand was the first Italian restaurant to offer diet options like gluten free pasta and pizza all while keeping it authentically Italian. I was very impressed with the creativity and attention to detail on the items in their menu, and most importantly the freshness of all their ingredients, which is very rare with Italian restaurants in Madrid. My favorite dish is the sexy pasta Bolognese which is their gluten free no calorie pasta option made from Japanese mushroom roots, I have never seen this option on any Italian restaurant’s menu anywhere in the world.

This to celebrate my wife's birthday (I told them this when res. made but no birthday things appeared). We all arrived at the restaurant on time or early except for 2 people who came in at 21:30 due to personal conflicts. We were finally seated by ourselves after a waiter said that it was alright to sit where we did. Pre-meal wine showed up after we asked for it, the wine was good and was reasonably priced. The acoustics in this restaurant are NOT good, they need sound deadning material on the ceiling therefore we could not hear well the specials of the evening, these were not written down anywhere. To make the long story short we didn't know what the specials were and many of the items on the main menu were not available, the 3 types of bacalaus for example. I finally ordered the chicken salad plate which never arrived. When we asked for more wine the waitress brought the wrong bottle. The pre-meal food was excellent and what did arrive was excellent as well. We were warned that we had to get out at 23:00, this as 22:45 despite the fact that some of our food STILL had not arrived. We finally cancelled whatever had not arrived and left the restaurant at around 23:15 despite the fact that there were empty tables.

We went twice in our our 5 day stay in Madrid. The absolute best dish we had there was the Cod Fish. Absolutely superb.

The staff were very welcoming and helpful advising us on the menu. We had heard that the barbecued beef was very good so we went with that as well as some bbq octopus and a salad and some chips. The KILO of beef ( between 2)was served rare and ready sliced for us and was delicious and they offered to cook it a little more if we thought it was too rare. The Octopus was my favourite being crispy on outside and super tender inside and seasoned beautifully. The owner recommended a Ribeiro del Duero which at €30 was not cheap but was the classiest thing that passed my lips that week , and a perfect partner to the beef. We the succumbed to the cheeseboard which had some delicious and interesting local cheeses. All in all a terrific find and one I'd recommend to anyone visiting Madrid looking for authentic home cooking away from the tourist traps at a reasonable price.

Cesar seated us immediately and brought over appetizers and took our drink orders. Then he came back and explained in English, because we don't understand Spanish, all of the specials of today. Cesar recommended we share plates. We had the tomatoes and mozzarella, the zucchini, the calamari, and the croquettes. We had plans for the other two nights in Madrid, however everything was so delicious on the first night we decided to go back the following night. Again, Cesar ordered for us. We had the beef cheeks, the octopus, and the lima beans. For dessert we had an amazing cheese platter. However, last night was our wedding anniversary. Because of Caesar's hospitality and the amazing food cooked from all-natural ingredients we just couldn't resist. We went back for the third night and had the white tuna, the sirloin steak, a salad, and the fried mushrooms. Once again we had the cheese assortment for dessert while my daughter had her the chocolate cake. Ceaser brought out the beef before it was prepared to view and explains it's organic history. He also took my son back to see the ham, the tuna, and let him go down and help pick out the cheese. What a great experience.

I only have great things to say about this place... not ONE negative comment to make I stumbled upon this restaurant thanks to TripAdvisor as it happens. At the time it was in the top three places to eat in Madrid - it still should be! - and as I lived in the center it wasn't difficult to get to.  While the first time we went was on a weekday early evening, so we were able to walk right in, friday to sunday dinners I would suggest booking in advance. Even during subsequent visits, when there were only two of us and we hadn't booked, the warm and welcoming staff were happy to make space even if it meant shifting a few tables.  The first thing I noticed about this place when walking in was the mouthwatering aroma of beautifully cooked Spanish food lingering in the air. In both restaurants the owner would personally seat us, keep conversation flowing throughout the dining experience and always be available for advice and recommendations. The staff all spoke perfect English, and even the owner of the Gaztambide branch who wasn't quite as fluent, would make jokes in Spanglish and recognize me everytime I came back.  Not only is this place perfectly romantic for couples, I went twice with family (just 2-3 of us) and another few times with a massive group of friends, which didn't make the service and food any less personable and punctual. I insisted some of my Spanish friends should book it for their birthdays, and they all raved about it and congratulated me on the fantastic find, all wishing that they had discovered the place years ago in their own hometown. Even my foodie friend whose parents own a restaurant took her family here and they were just bowled over. Which seems to be the general reaction. As for the food, be it recommendations from the staff, or the complimentary 'amuse-bouche' that came with every meal (from many types of warm fresh bread and cheeses, to tangy shots of gazpacho) or the array of amazing desserts (and I learnt that Spain weren't the best at cakes and desserts, perhaps it's their flour.... but this place changed that perception in seconds) It was all absolutely breathtaking. If I didnt have favourites that I would continually choose, I would have loved to get through the entire menu. ahhh the favourites (see pictures)... MUST ORDER:  -Kilo of Kobe Beef Now i'm not a steak/beef/burger fan whatsoever. It's always been too chewy for me, or lacking flavour. So when (only thanks to a recommendation by the staff) we ordered a kilo of Kobe beef, rare and still moo-ing on the plate (at a ridiculously cheap price of £30) which came with potatoes and green peppers, i was a little apprehensive. It was the most succulent, melt-in-the-mouth, delicious meat I had ever tasted. And the portion was so huge, but too delectable to waste. This dish alone is a reason for anyone to come here. -Croquettas (especially the goats cheese and honey) Delicate, perfectly crispy on the outside and silky smooth on the inside. Possibly the best croquettas I've tasted... and I've had a fair few in my day -Calamari Commonly overcooked, chewy and bland. Not this time! Perfection -Desserts Because you couldn't possibly choose as everyone of the desserts are heavenly. But the Tiramisu inside a toblerone is a stroke of genius!!! Even though we were bursting at the seams from all the food, we HAD to have some of this. We ended up waddling home, our bellies pregnant with the tastiest meal I'd eaten in a very long time. But the real icing on the cake was the bill at the end. For such attentive, creative fine-dining the price was extremely reasonable, making Alcaravea free from that 'fine-dining' pretentious nature.

The service was exceptional, we were lucky enough to be served by César the owner I think. His English is excellent and he explained the various dishes (suggesting we share) in great detail and passion. Told us what had come in that day. He also guided us through the menu towards what would suit us the best. So the food?! Truly exceptional. I loved everything. The squid. Pork scratchings (don't be put off by the description) and pork isn't my favourite meat. I could go on but I'm already salivating just thinking of it again. Oh and the cheeses. Superb. Also I'm told all the wines just have a10€ mark up so not paying over the top for a decent bottle of wine. And the bill? Unbelievably modest bearing in mind we stuffed ourselves.

It has a busy almost manic atmosphere with the waiters rushing round between tables but everything we ordered arrived quickly and with no errors. The Rioja is excellent too. Decor is authentic - certainly not plush - but suits the atmosphere well.

We cabbed to this local neighborhood to this small storefront, questioning each other ""Is this it?

We went with his recommendation for an appetizer consisting of 5 (x 2, one for each of us) very interesting tapas, all scrumptious. For our mains, we ordered the Secreto Iberian Pork w/Parmesian - that was perhaps my favorite entree of our entire trip, so rich and tender, with just the right amount of sea salt, and an order of a medley of mushrooms. So many things sounded great on the menu but he held us back from ordering more - and we were so stuffed, we couldn't even order a dessert (tho we declared earlier that we were ""definitely"" going to indulge in one)! Add in a reasonable bottle of wine and for $100US, we were ""fat and <oh-so> happy"" heading home. We would absolutely return to this wonderful ""find"" to partake alongside the locals.

It was a bit different for us to get used to the ""Tapas"" concept, but it worked out fine. I can say that we had the BEST Jamon Iberico we have ever eaten in our lives and there are no words to describe the tender, sumptuous flavor of the ""Secreto Iberico Pork"" (it's a cut from the side, along the ribs, made with rock salt and served with potatoes) we ate! This dish is a MUST! We also shared the calamari in black ink rice that was unbelievably delicious. A much ordered dish (and a perfect accompaniament to the food) was the medly of mushrooms we couldn't get enough of! We were too embarrassed to return a second night in a row, but when we arrived back in Madrid 7 days later, that is where we headed again to eat the same things, as we knew from eating all over Spain on our trip, we would never have a meal of this caliber again!

We went for the menu del dia, which includes appetiser, bread, starter, mains, dessert and bottle of wine all for €12!

From the moment we entered there was a great atmosphere, first in the busy bar, and then in the restaurant itself where our host went out of his way to make us feel at home. He personally talked us through what was on offer that day and it was refreshing not to have to trawl through a standard menu. The tomato and buratta salad started (mozarella-like local cheese that melts in the mouth) was sublime and could easily have fed four people.

Waiter Cesar, who speaks English well, suggested that I have a mullet fish prepared in the Spanish way. This incredible dish included two filets (left and right sides of the mullet) in a wonderful, spicy sauce, and the skelaton of the fish deep-fried to a wonderful crispness that allows one to eat it, minus the head, like a cracker. Not only was this dish delicious, it was also quite a sight.  As with many Madrid restaurants, things are quiet before 9 at night. The dinner crew didn´t fully arrive until that time.  Note that there are three versions of this restaurant, all under the same ownership and with the same menu. Two are located within a couple of blocks of each other, the third at a distance.

Three of us ordered the specials, which included first and main courses, and dessert or coffee. All of the first-course portions that our group chose were large enough to be the main course. Two of our dishes came with little peppers that the waiter called pimentos. They were amazing! I'd go back there just for those little peppers!  The sangria was one of the best I've had. It actually had alcohol in it and didn't taste like Kool-aid. We each had a different desert and shared. I wasn't crazy about the chocolate cake, but the flan was ok and the cheesecake was good.

The food was tasty, plentiful and priced fairly (we shared a special of parrillada mixta de carne -- a mixed grill) as well as patatas bravas with two sauces, and a couple glasses of the house red.  While the food was probably just a bit above average in quality, the service was the most friendly and helpful we experienced in our trip. (Our waiter talked us out of another tapas order, fearing we wouldn't be able to finish our meal. We were grateful for the assistance as, the night previously, we ended up wasting most of the sumptuous serving of paella at the nearby Naturbier tavern because my remedial Spanish and inexperience ordering tapas led us to gorge on raciones, leaving us ill-prepared to tackle the paella, which was the best of three I had in Spain. Regrets.) Atmosphere: an unpretentious neighborhood saloon (though not a punch-your-way-out type of bar by any stretch) with some interesting decor on the walls that America's flair-heavy chains could only hope to replicate). A raucous though convivial union meeting of, I believe, medical services employees occurred downstairs, which added a beer hall-like frisson to the night that we appreciated.  Cuisine was fine, but by no means the best of our stay, but the restaurant experience at El Buscon topped them all.

However, initially we almost left as the waiter walked across and literally threw the menus & settings at our table . However, it was worth persevering as the service improved and the food was of top quality.  Firstly, the complimentary jamon and cheese were of excellent quality. We then had: Tortilla espanola which was the best we tasted in Madrid, perfectly cooked Grilled aubergine which was delicious once dressed with their high quality olive oil Rabo de toro - a real feast and absolutely divine. The star dish! Patatas bravas - again simple but the best we had in Madrid.
