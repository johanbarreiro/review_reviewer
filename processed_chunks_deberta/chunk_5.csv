I couldn't resist returning back to the restaurant to try another delicious entree. I had a version of a meat lover's pizza, and was blown away. I also enjoyed the sangria, and a cheesecake for dessert. I had a pasta dish for dinner.  This place takes card, and if you're traveling from the US, has the option to pay in USD.

Every dish we ordered was superb, fresh fried chicken with 3 dips, crispy boar rolls, and the Duck confit with prunes and potatoes, wow! We finished off with two pieces of the lightest, creamiest, tastiest cheesecake. We enjoyed it so much we went back with our friends the following day.

Missing what I have had before, I called for a reservation for two at Metro Bistro Plaza Mayor and opted for the tasting menu.  To my disappointment, it didn't turn out as good as I had expected. Another friend of mine had warned me before hand that, in her opinion, the Debod branch was better.  The bread and butter were as same as those in Debod. I enjoyed the curry bread and orange-chocolate ones, although they were a bit too hard and too dry for my taste. Our first dish was the salmorejo with olive oil ice-cream. It was soooo good that blew me away. However the upcoming dishes came with mix feelings.  The sea treasure was fine but way too salty and you get tired of the taste after 2-3 bites. The baked vegetable salad was fine.The eel added a nice flavour to it, however they put too little eel in the salad to be enjoyed thoroughly.  Then we proceed to main dishes. The black pearl was the star. Perfectly cooked. Black rice risotto was relish and the curry added great flavour combo. We finished our menu with iberian pork. The pork was good but the side dish was something like a purple cabbage roll was a real miss! Way too sour for me.  The first dessert, pineapple cannelloni was way too sweet. I had nothing to complain for the tribute to chocolate, since it is always my favourite at Metro Bistro.  The service was great. The staffs speak pretty well english and are very attentive regardless the restaurant is busy. However, I think the tasting menu on that day didn't flow. (Not sure that they change seasonally or not). It was like high and low all the time.  I'd go back not for the menu but for the a la carte options or otherwise just directly to the Debod one. The price-quality relation was okay and the price for the menu was reasonable. The drinks were well-priced too.",2015-08-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6498928-Reviews-or320-Metro_Bistro_Plaza_Mayor-Madrid.html,UID_2350,0.042,0.798,0.16,0.9939,0.1983119658119658,0.5010037256191102,0.4245777777777778,1930,165,0.0854922279792746,1,50,False,73,0.1714285714285714,0.1428571428571428,0.2428571428571428,0.0714285714285714,0.1571428571428571,0.0142857142857142,0.0285714285714285,0.0571428571428571,0.0714285714285714,0.0428571428571428,351,214,4.481481481481482,0,0,regular visitor metro bistro debod year sinc chang fusion latin mediterranean menu miss call reserv two metro bistro plaza mayor opt tast menu disappoint turn good expect anoth friend mine warn hand opinion debod branch better bread butter debod enjoy curri bread orang chocol one although bit hard dri tast first dish salmorejo oliv oil ice cream soooo good blew away howev upcom dish came mix feel sea treasur fine way salti get tire tast bite bake veget salad fine eel ad nice flavour howev put littl eel salad enjoy thoroughli proceed main dish black pearl star perfectli cook black rice risotto relish curri ad great flavour combo finish menu iberian pork pork good side dish someth like purpl cabbag roll real miss way sour first dessert pineappl cannelloni way sweet noth complain tribut chocol sinc alway favourit metro bistro servic great staff speak pretti well english attent regardless restaur busi howev think tast menu day flow sure chang season like high low time go back menu la cart option otherwis directli debod one price qualiti relat okay price menu reason drink well price,average review,3

We will definitely be back to try more of their unique tapas. This is very reasonably priced and very creative cuisine! First of all, you must try their ""grilled cheese,"" which is basically a huge plank of white cheese, creamy and gooey in the middle and crispy and caramelized at the edges. This gorgeous goo is drowning in a pool of heavenly tomato jam and topped with an earthy dose of pesto and a drizzle of balsamic. Served with crusty baguette, it's probably the most sinful and tasty tapa we've experience in our 11 days in Spain. Also phenomenal are the crispy boar rolls with portabella mushroom sauce: WOW. We split these two items and we were perfectly full. Add in a sangria, bottled water, and two beers and our bill was only 30€... So don't leave Madrid without eating here at least once (or twice:))! If you're looking for something with a little more international flair (and don't mind a slightly skanky bathroom overflowing with beer cases, which I thought only added to El Minibar's eccentric charm), this place is for you.

It is located in a deserted alley near the Congress Hall. There are some Indian and Peruvian restaurants nearby.  Spanish restaurants generally open late but this steakhouse runs from 1:30pm till wee hours without breaks so you can avoid the crowd and have an early dinner like us n many other foreigners. Locals come in after 8pm in general. The Angus steaks are so tender unlike what we had experienced in uk and other countries. No extra sauces given and not needed either anyway. There is a dish of herbal olive oil on the table that goes well with the meat but even better with the fries. We asked for a second dish. The many choices of Homemade desserts are recommended too. We had custard with sweet caramel sauce that was just the right thing for a strong cup of coffee.  Nice ambience but some waitress have limited English ability. There are English menus so worry not.

Me and my boyfriend came here for dinner without a reservation (our fault) and there was quite a long wait to sit and eat, this wasn't a problem it was the fact that we weren't updated at all on the waiting time. We were told 35 mins at first and we waited well over an hour. When we were eventually sat, the table was covered in small hairs which was really odd. The waitresses were perfectly nice, the wine was good and then we were offered some bread which we took thinking it was a complimentary and was then shocked to see that they were charged for on the bill! The steaks were extremely under cooked, so bad that we had to ask for them to be cooked for a little longer. I blame the mistakes on the fact it was extremely busy with a line of people waiting for tables however it was unfortunate that we had to suffer due to this.

From the moment we went in, the service was iffy: we were sat right by the door where people were coming and going throughout the meal. I assumed the restaurant was full, except I later discovered plenty of available seating downstairs! After taking our orders, the waiters forgot our drinks (we had to remind them about 30 minutes later). Then, I went to use the toilet but it wasn't clear where the toilets were, so I tried to ask a waiter for directions: I received a snarky reply, and whilst I was trying to listen, another waiter barged straight into me with a couple of menus - ouch! I rubbed my head and looked at him, waiting for an apology...silence.  Enter the main meals: I can't speak for all the meals, but the pork dish with sweet potato was quite small considering the 7 euro price and I left the restaurant feeling hungry! At one point I wanted to try my friend's food, but needed to ask the waiter a question first: when I tried to ask, he snatched the dish away before I could finish the question and my friend waited another 25 minutes for a new meal.  To top it all off, once the waiters had collected our plates they came back immediately with a receipt: I've never experienced anything like that - it felt like they wanted us out as soon as possible. We left pretty soon after that! So overall, a pretty exterior but poor - borderline rude - service and portion sizes that don't justify the price at all.

One is reminded of a Jimmy Buffett concert with paper patriots and a festive atmosphere. Of the food I received, which was either a tapas or super tapas, was delicious perhaps somewhat heavy on the sauces for my tastes.  There was a comedic element in that less than one half of my order I actually received yet I also received food I did not order. For example, my water order never made it, but the pork which I did not order promptly arrived. There may have been a translation issue and the staff cheerfully took care of the extra plates. If I could only have received my water! The whole experience added to the quirkiness, again not in a bad way.

The customer service, food, and drinks were all on point. This place has a comfortable hipster/laid back family vibe that made me feel welcomed and relaxed. The dining tables were also spaced out enough to allow for a bit of privacy for conversations which was very nice! I only tried two drinks which included the tinto de verano (sangria) for 3 Euro and the mojito for 7 Euro. Best mojito I've had so far!  I ended up going two nights in a row so I can try a variety of things on the menu. I was with my boyfriend and between the two nights we enjoyed the Crispy boar rolls, Cod + shrimp, and the Iberian sirloin with veggies and then the sirloin again but with grilled potatoes, green peppers and tomatoes. We wanted to go a back for a third time but also wanted to try other tapas bars around Madrid. Well, we ultimately regret that choice!

Looking for a good dinner in the center of Madrid can be also quite difficult seeing the quantity of restaurants and tapas bars. But Rosi La Loca delivered on both. I called ahead to make a reservation (which is advisable for later dinner times as the place is tiny and draws quite a crowd during dinner time), the restaurant called back an hour before our arrival to confirm the reservation (even some of the big and famous restaurants don't do that) and we have been received with a warm and personal welcome once we stepped into the simple yet nicely decorated restaurant. We decided to share a couple of the dishes from the menu, which has a good selection of tapas for everyone yet isn't overloaded with items. The food was well prepared and very tasty. For drinks try their Mojitos (especially the one with strawberry!). The service overall was very friendly, welcoming and fast.  The bad: There is nothing really to point out that was negative - yes, the hanging garden at the entrance was missing a couple of plants but the staff told me that they are updating the decor of the restaurant bit by bit. They are also working together with tourist groups so don't be surprised when now and then a large group guided by someone with an umbrella storms the restaurant to have a couple of tapas and drinks before they all leave as quickly as they entered the restaurant. The conclusion: For a small restaurant / tapas bar in the dead center of Madrid this place is definitely worth stopping by and try some of their cocktails and delicious tapas. It is a bit off from the big main street Gran Via so it is perfect if you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the big city, your sightseeing or shopping. The food is delicious, the drinks are strong and the staff is very friendly, welcoming and helpful.

We were walking back to our hotel and we decided to stop by Oven Mozzarella Bar in Gran Via. It looked pretty cool and elegant from outside. We noticed that it was really hard to get a table, it looked that there was quite a long wait.  We were lucky: weird enough, some tables were cleaned in a matter of 5 minutes and we were comfortably seated. Our table was very close to the kitchen so it was fun to watch the pizza men doing their lovely job....it was like a beautiful show. We ordered pizza margherita, chicken pizza, spicy prawn linguine, and salmon in hollandaise sauce with baked potatoes. The pizza were crunchy and good, but they...forgot to add tomato sauce. What kind of Margherita pizza was that, without red tomatoes sauce? For dessert we had apple crumble cake and affogato di caffe' (an Italian coffee-based dessert which takes the form of a scoop of vanilla gelato ""drowned"" with a shot of hot espresso). Everything was pretty tasty. We had a problem with the waiter: in taking our orders, he forgot to write down ""the timing"" of what we wanted. The result was that the pizzas and main courses came to our table all together...and we had to send back the pasta and the salmon for later. For that reason, when the spiced linguine returned, they were cold and over-cooked. Certainly the place is beautiful, elegant, spacious, clean with a lovey and stylish  décor. It was a nice surprice to find out at second floor a gigantic portrait of a smiling Rita Hayworth on the brick wall and, next to the restrooms, three charming Greek-style amphorae as washbasins, with a bright-red neon sign 'bacio' (kiss). Reasonable prices. Service must be tutored.

Out of all the tapas bars I visted. (And there were a lot) This was by far the best.  You are greeted very warmly by the staff behind the bar and a very lively atmosphere as you walk down the steps into the place.  The serving staff are very helpful if you are not sure on what to order, you also get a complementary snack when you order drinks too. As for the food, I highly recommed the goats cheese, it was full of flavour.  The cod with shrimp I had on my last visit is also worth mentioning, the cod was cooked to perfection and you get a slight kick of heat right at the end. The only downside to this bar is the size, it only has ten tables.  Because of it's high ratings (and deservedly so) it does get very busy during peak periods, not just tourists like myself but locals too.  I would recommend making a reservation or expect to have to wait at the bar for at least 15-20 minutes, 30 at most.  Also it's not really a place if you are a vegetarian, from memory I think it only has two dishes that don't contain meat. Even though Tripadvisor says it's vegetarian friendly (you have been warned)  All in all a very pleasant experience and well worth a visit for every traveller to Madrid.",2018-09-28,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3688138-Reviews-or230-El_miniBAR-Madrid.html,UID_5232,0.027,0.854,0.119,0.973,0.1691960816960817,0.5191086691086692,0.4567454545454545,1257,128,0.101829753381066,0,31,False,59,0.15,0.125,0.35,0.1,0.175,0.025,0.0,0.025,0.05,0.0,242,156,4.169421487603306,0,0,visit three time eat stay madrid tapa bar vist lot far best greet warmli staff behind bar live atmospher walk step place serv staff help sure order also get complementari snack order drink food highli recom goat chees full flavour cod shrimp last visit also worth mention cod cook perfect get slight kick heat right end downsid bar size ten tabl high rate deservedli get busi peak period tourist like local would recommend make reserv expect wait bar least minut also realli place vegetarian memori think two dish contain meat even though tripadvisor say vegetarian friendli warn pleasant experi well worth visit everi travel madrid,very good review,5

The bar is in the center, just 2 minutes walk from Opera Madrid.  The bar is interesting with a lot of weird paintings. The stuff is really nice. When we ordered they brought us a complimentary dish (small jamón sandwiches and chips) and glasses of water. We took the grilled cheese and a glass of sangria.  There are different prices for eating inside and outside which I find strange. Keep in mind that outside it will be slightly more expensive.

We also went on to order the squid strips but couldn't manage to finish them. We were served bread with our meal and crisps and nuts with our drinks before we ordered.

It is situated in the centre of Madrid in the Santo Domingo quarter. The bar is owned by Nacho and Dani; they are both lovely, friendly guys who make everyone feel so welcome, as though you were an old friend. Another member of staff deserves a mention and that is Norma; she was so helpful and did everything with a smile. The bar was very busy with a great atmosphere, quirky décor (which adds to the charm) and great food too. We really must recommend the Grilled Cheese tapas (voted best in Madrid 2013), it was exquisite and we didn't want it to end! As for the drinks, the Mojito was one of the best we've ever had and the strawberry and black gin was very yummy. We loved the way the gin was served at the table with the tonic poured down a knife into the glass!! We highly recommend a visit to this brilliant bar; when we return to Madrid we will certainly make a beeline for it.

So I think I can write an honest and fair review. The reason I was in Madrid this long was for a study course and the reason to visit a burger bar, was to be able to eat ""normal food"" in stead of all the tapas that Madrid is filled with. Don't get me wrong, I don't think there is something wrong with tapas, but I don't like to eat the same thing all the time. Anyways, the first time I visited the Steakburger Bar Atocha, was also in my first week in Madrid. I was looking for a place where I could eat, but also where I could take out my study books and study in peace. I found this quite little corner in the restaurant and made my seat comfy with all the cushions they have. I sat there at about 17:00h. (a little early for Madrid, but normal for the place where I live) so the place was nearly empty. During the evening it got more busy, until it was completely full and every table was occupied. Even though I was holding a table all alone, sitting there, studying (I had a burger in between and some coffee), the waiters did not beg me to leave at all. I left the place after 23:00. The day after I scored a 9 out of 10 on my exam, so from that day on, Steakburger Bar Atocha was my lucky study place :P  And indeed, every time I had an exam at school, I went to the Steakburger Bar to eat and study, at the same table in the same corner, keeping the table all by myself even during rush hours and never got I any annoying look, or remark from the waiters. Instead, they started to recognize me and showed interest in the study I was doing, which was a Cocktail Bartender study. One of the waiters told me he liked to shake cocktails as well and we got a good click together. I even invited him to my table when his shift was over, so we could talk about cocktails and other stuff. He gave me a very nice recipe for a passion fruit version of a Maitai. In the end, I scored big time on all my exams, so I really believe eating at this Steakburger Bar brings you good luck. For the rest, I can assure you will love the burgers they serve. They use good meat and you can choose between Beef or Ox burger. You can also choose what size burger you like, from small to XXL. The money you pay for it, is fair. Not too expensive, also not cheap, but I think it is right. Anyway, let me sum up the good things about this Steakburger Bar. + Good Luck Bar + Good music (they play lots of madonna, 70ties, pop, music that gays love and that is always good music) + Good burgers, well proportioned, nice meat + You can choose between beef and ox + Fair prices + They serve cocktails as well + Friendly service + Comfy cushions to adjust your seat + Relaxed atmosphere  + Mixed public (single ppl, couples, families, tourists, Madrileens) + Gay friendly  + You can pay by credit card + There is an outside terras  + It is next to Atocha Trainstation + It is next to Reina Sofia Museum + It is at walking distance to the districts of Lavapies, Salamanca and Retiro I promise, you will love this Steakburger Bar. I sure will visit it again next time when I will travel to Madrid. I don't know when that will be, but I sure hope this restaurant will still be there.

A charming man on the door offered us sangria while we waited for a table which quickly became available. The restaurant was full of both tourists and locals, and had a fantastic atmosphere. We enjoyed a dish of aubergine chips in honey before sharing a delicious paella. The paella was cooked to order, so yes, we had a 30 minute wait for it, but it was so worth the wait!

Finally, they promised free desserts to compensate and when we got to order the third dessert, they announced that they only offer two...

Just to correct your inaccuracies, you were clearly informed my friends steak was over salty and his potatoes were raw in the middle after he tried them. He had not eaten half of either steaks that were cooked, in both cases he had barely touched them. I tried both the first steak and potatoes and they were as he described. The steak was changed but no effort was made to change the potatoes and when he raised this, we waited 10 minutes and gave up when nothing came. Yes we were offered a reduction of the bill but in both cases that steaks were brought to my friend, they were barely touched. In addition, the staff gave us shots of liquor at the end as a token. We did not touch these, paid our bill and left. I was reasonably happy with my meal, I wasn't happy that I could not eat with my friend as his meal was not the same. My friend and I were not rude to either the staff or other diners, but my friend was obviously unhappy with his meal and informed staff accordingly.

Definitely a deal worth doing. We were a bit hesitant when we realised it was in a hotel, however our reservations were quickly put to bed by the quality service, good atmosphere and excellent service. We ordered lobster paella, steak and white fish. The lobster paella was huge, each person getting 2 small lobsters and a mound of rice. Delicious! The steak and fish were cooked perfectly, however the only criticism is that the accompaniments were tiny ie 1 new potato and 2 beans.  Would definitely recommend a trip.

And I am so glad we didn't! They allowed us to dine and all I can say is that it was a once in a lifetime experience... The service was elegant, and enhanced our evening. The food was fabulous -- so unique, and truly memorable! Loved the croquettes and tempura vegetable appetizers. The 'Iberian Prey' (pork) with goat cheese and apples was truly enjoyed by my husband. And my oxtail was something that I doubt I will ever experience again, except maybe in heaven. Now I'm sorry I didn't meet the chef... We didn't have room for dessert, but received a wonderful complimentary liquor made from the symbolic strawberry tree of the Madrid coat of arms (not so much a liqueur but more similar to a Canadian icewine). I doubt that the restaurants at The Hotel Ritz or The Westin Palace could do this well at this value! And make you feel so welcome. Please do not miss the opportunity to have dinner here.

My daughter checked out Tripadvisor and chose miniBar because it was close to where we needed to end up. She chose WISELY! We were immediately greeted by the most exuberant and friendly waiter who guided us quickly to a free table and took our drinks order. By the time he returned with our drinks we had selected our meals. We chose the croquettas, the confit duck leg, the thinly sliced grilled cheese and something else. Our drinks were superb, and made with some real flair, and tasted great. The staff and owner seemed to be dancing and singing their way through service and it was a joy to behold. It made the place have a vibrance and friendliness that was fantastic. The highlight of the meal was the melted cheese and bread. It was simply amazing. We all loved it, and in fact, we returned for lunch the next day so that we could experience it again. This place is SOOOO much fun. The same thing happened the next day, except the owner was so impressed that we should return the very next day that he offered some superb aperitifs after our meal. Apparently it was a home made version of Baileys. Whatever it as, it was fabulous and we loved the enthusiasm!!

It was hot (we saw a sign at 44C later) but we nevertheless went on the nice terrasse. Ordered tinto de Verano (sangria) that was the best I ever tasted (I had to order a second one later :-) ). Wife took a simple Coke. When they brought the drinks the server brought tapas (sausage), they were ok but we did not pay for them so we were not in a place to criticize. My wife ordered chicken breast cubes with spicy cheese sauce (with tortillas Mexican style) and I ordered bocadillos pollo caramelizado (caramalized chicken sandwich) and we agreed to share before we received the plates.

It was raining so we could only have sit inside and it was busy, but as this is usually a good sign we decided to wait at the bar for a table. The staff were great, they gave some snacks to eat with our drinks and pretty soon we had a table. We asked for a recommendation on what to have for our lunch and it sounded great so we went with it. We weren't disappointed! We ordered the Cheese which was a hot skillet of melted cheese with a sticky tomato relish, pesto and olive oil in different areas, kind of like a four seasons pizza made entirely out of cheese. Served with some fresh bread. The soft rind was left on in parts and melted to an amazing chewy texture. It was incredible!  The second dish was the Wild Boar, essentially pulled pork wrapped in thin pastry and fried, like a large spring roll made entirely out of meat. The Boar has a distinctive flavour, quite different from normal pork and it was also really nice. Very rich so I couldn't have eaten much more. Maybe not the healthiest food but who cares, we're on holiday! Service and staff were excellent, food was amazing, prices were reasonable.

Then the drinks - I had gin and tonic (massive, at 5.50 Euro) and then Sangria. Both were really good. For food I wanted something smaller (as they already served me some tapas with drink before) and I was recommended toast with salmon. Again, it was delicious.

My selection of tapas (tuna, dumplings and teriyaki chicken) was very good and I was all set to write up a fabulous review. But then, The following day before flying home from our weekend break, we stopped off for lunch as the menu had 'worked' for both of us the previous evening. This time I went for the fixed price lunchtime menu. Within a few hours I felt unwell and my delayed flight home was sheer hell as I clearly had classic food poisoning symptoms (...as a qualified Microbiologist I think I know this). I hadn't eaten anywhere else, so unfortunately the rave review I was going to give Rosi la Loca has rapidly evaporated. The staff were extremely friendly and were working very hard. Perhaps I could have eaten here a hundred times and not had a problem, but I can only speak from the experience I had which left me off work for a day and lamenting our decision to return for the second lunchtime visit which ruined my memories of a weekend in Madrid.  For that reason I cannot recommend.

The burgers are prepared to your liking; rare, medium, or well done. We had oxburgers (a small premium) and they were superb. For those that like cerveza you can get pints, hard to find in Madrid.

But we couldn't find it again once it was dark. We were within 2 blocks of it several times. We asked waiters and shopkeepers. Nobody knows this street. My friend's brother came to where we were standing and walked us to the restaurant. We were about 500ft but we couldn't find it with these corkscrew streets.  We got a very warm welcome from the owner when we arrived. We opted for racciones (think tapas but more substantial). We ordered these wonderful crispy boar rolls and Andalusia potatoes. The boar rolls were amazing and who doesn't like potatoes? Very reasonably priced for the quality of the food.
