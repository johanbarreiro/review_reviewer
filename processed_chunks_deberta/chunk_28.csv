Plaza Mayor has a lot of touristy restaurants with horrible food but the food here was freshly prepared and very good. The waiters provided excellent service. We sat in the main dining room just inside the doors. It was slightly warmer there because of the kitchen but they had ceiling fans which made it more comfortable. You can also sit outside or in the basement dining room, which is surprisingly nice. We started with the arugula and caprese salads. We also tried the mushroom and fresh clams pastas.

The place is very small with only about 6 seats at the bar upstairs. We struck up a conversation with 2 interesting gentlemen from the Netherlands sitting next to us. They said they were wine aficionados and were checking out the neighborhood bars. They also said there was more seating downstairs, but we chose to stand at the bar, which turned out to be a good choice, because a couple seated next to us left after about 10 minutes.  With our new friends recommending the seafood at La Concha, I had the tosta de bacalao ahumado (smoked cod on toast) and it was amazingly good! My gf had tosta de gambas (Prawns on toast (with mayonnaise and spring onion spread). She said it was so good she could have eaten more!

We came out at night looking to pop into a couple tapas bars and decided to start at Casa Lucas. We arrived just as it was opening at 8pm and we're lucky enough to get a table as less than 10 mins later the place was full and people were being turned away or told to wait for a table. Without doubt Casa Lucas sell top quality tapas and wine and it would have been very easy to have a full meal here ( maybe next time). Everything we ordered was first class with both hot and cold pinchos being worthy of mention. In addition the service was first class.

I was trying to find a place to eat dinner where there was a menu with English subtitles but also an atmosphere where I would feel comfortable being a woman alone and the H10 Bar was it! I stopped in about 9.45 pm and asked for a little two top table for myself and they made me feel so welcome. I had a lovely glass of wine and the Mediterranean salad and grilled shrimp in garlic and it was the perfect amount of food for a non-Spaniard at that time of night. Both were very very good and when I was checking out they offered me a free post dinner taste of a lovely aperitif. They spoke English well enough that I was in good hands and very happy I had chosen this restaurant. The outside doesn't look like much and it was very narrow and somewhat small inside but it was lovely with a very clean restroom. I would definitely recommend.

Being gluten free she had researched on TA and found that La Concha served gluten free tapas, and they sure did.

We then ordered a pork cheek dish, it came with a beautiful sauce, mashed potatoes and small green beans, again really tasty then we had a baked red pepper in cheesy goodness, more bread.

This was a real treat for my wife and me too. Then they sent us on our way with a half strawberry drizzled with chocolate, 33.50 Euros seems like standard prices.

The pinchos are great!! They cost 8€. Compared with the plates are a bit expensive but they are delicious. The most famous is the Morcilla. That plates (raciones) are between 17€ and 20€ each. Its not on the menu but we can ask which one serve half portion so, if you are just two you can try more things asking half portions. Rabo de boy its top! I dont appreciate meat but these is really something! The calamares are very nice and tender. There are one of the biggest portions too, if you are many or if you are hungry and dont want to spent a lot it will be a good choice. The tuna tataki with apple mouse ist delicious. For Gaspacho lovers you must try Salmorejo, its a cold tomato soup. You can try several wines, having a glass or a bottle. The glasse of win its 3€. The bottle will be aprox. 18€. We payed 42€ for tataki half portion, and a portion of salmorejo and rabo de boy with four glasses of wine. I'm sure i'll get back to try the mushroom rice and the bacalao.

Try to get in early or be prepared to wait in line! Hubby and I ordered some hot tapas and two dishes to share amongst ourselves. For tapas, we had the grilled pork served on white bread and a bed a caramalized onions. The pork was so succulent and went very well with the sweet onions. I am not a fan of onions but had to admit that the combo really worked. For our mains, we ordered the bacon wrapped calamari with ink mousse that everyone raves about and ink cannelloni with seafood served with cream sauce. The calamari was to die for! Thick strips of lightly battered calamari wrapped with bacon, then tossed in the ink mousse. The presentation was really nice when the dish was brought to our table but then the waiter quickly cut and mix everything up before I could snap a photo of it. It looked like a big pile of mess when he was done but it was very tasty. They adjusted the serving size from three bundles of calamari to two because there were only the two of us. We both wish they had not done that! We could have eaten the full portion... I personally did not enjoy the cannelloni at all. It had only a few tiny pieces of shrimps inside and the rest was roastsd vegetables. I found the cream sauce not complimenting the ink pasta too well but hubby happily gobbled everything up. Overall, dinner was very good. The calamari is a must for those who go to Casa Lucas. It was a truly delicious and memorable dish.

We were impressed with the reviews for Malatesta and decided to pay it a visit. Reviews say the lunch deal was great value - to be honest it was average, as we'd been finding lots of great deals just by chance and this one was actually slightly more expensive than others (probably due to the central location). The restaurant is down a lane, is appealing and inviting, but once sat, the staff really couldn't be bothered with us to be honest. We don't speak much Spanish but tried our best to decipher the menu with our phrasebook, so I only had 2 questions about the dishes, but the waitress just sighed and gave half-hearted replies. We asked for 'pan', (bread), the waiter said 'si' but 15 minutes later no bread has been brought. We then asked the waitress the same question and she dumped 3 packets of mass-produced breadsticks on our table, saying 'this is all we have' (how can a genuine Italian restaurant not have any bread?!). Starters arrived promptly and were tasty and fresh, so no complaints there. I ordered the pizza for my main course and my husband the ravioli. Like previous reviewers have said, the pizza was massive, but it was also authentic and delicious. My husband counted that he had been given 8 pieces of ravioli (fair enough - it was lunchtime after all, but next to my huge pizza the portion looked a bit stingy). But what made this so annoying was that the table next to us appeared to be locals, and when their ravioli arrived, it was a much larger portion, complete with parmesan and basil garnishes. We were not offered parmesan or black pepper and had to continuously ask for things when they should have been offered automatically. We passed on dessert, even though it was included, not because of the food but because of the service. Its a shame - I hate it when places assume that just because you are a visitor then its ok to give bad service. Surely they must know sites like Trip Advisor are invaluable to their business. Hope the service improves as the food was actually really good.",2013-08-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1963635-Reviews-or390-Trattoria_Malatesta-Madrid.html,UID_24636,0.066,0.774,0.16,0.9909,0.1967995169082124,0.5071256038647343,0.58871875,2213,201,0.0908269317668323,2,62,False,87,0.0561797752808988,0.1348314606741573,0.2247191011235955,0.0561797752808988,0.1348314606741573,0.0674157303370786,0.0786516853932584,0.0786516853932584,0.0786516853932584,0.0898876404494382,401,239,4.521197007481296,0,0,look trip advisor nice italian eat lunch rd day stay madrid husband half italian excel italian cook miss pasta impress review malatesta decid pay visit review say lunch deal great valu honest averag find lot great deal chanc one actual slightli expens other probabl due central locat restaur lane appeal invit sat staff realli bother us honest speak much spanish tri best deciph menu phrasebook question dish waitress sigh gave half heart repli ask pan bread waiter said si minut later bread brought ask waitress question dump packet mass produc breadstick tabl say genuin italian restaur bread starter arriv promptli tasti fresh complaint order pizza main cours husband ravioli like previou review said pizza massiv also authent delici husband count given piec ravioli fair enough lunchtim next huge pizza portion look bit stingi made annoy tabl next us appear local ravioli arriv much larger portion complet parmesan basil garnish offer parmesan black pepper continu ask thing offer automat pass dessert even though includ food servic shame hate place assum visitor ok give bad servic sure must know site like trip advisor invalu busi hope servic improv food actual realli good,average review,3

Malatesta successfully strikes a difficult balance of value, service and atmosphere. The place offers a terraza, a first floor with windows and an intimate basement, perfect for a meal in the blazing Castillan summer. I been there twice, most recently with my girlfriend, with whom we are always on the hunt for good ""menu del dia"" lunches in Madrid. We sat in the basement, and ordered from the prix fixe menu (12€). Our firsts were a tuna carpaccio and italian croquetas, both very good. The tuna was chilled and sliced thin with a drizzle of olive oil, very well done. The italian croquetas were stuffed with Cabrales cheese, and had a silky texture and satisfying substance. A good start indeed. Seconds were a zucchini and pesto lasagna and penne bolognese. The lasagna was light and flavorful and the penne were great, with a slow-cooked, rich bolognese sauce with the right acidity and balance. Desserts: panna cotta with a rasperry coulis and sliced pineapple with vainilla ice cream. Very good!

The service just didn't work for me. I don't speak Spanish as fast as a native, but waiting two seconds for the answer was too much to ask. If the first question would have been ""have you been here before?"", everything would have been maybe better. Young local guy had wrong ""Japanese cuisine expert"" attitude. Second dot out because a professional chef doesn't handshake with a customer and then use the same hand (without washing) to slap the okonomiyakis. The open kitchen and chefs look great, but seeing that next to me was not something I wanted to see. I took this time Osaka style since I didn't have too much time to wait.

There is a small dining room on the main floor and a larger dining area downstairs. They open at 1:30 pm. We arrived on a Saturday at 2:00 and didn´t have any problem being seated right away. But it got busy quickly, so if you plan on eating later, best to have a reservation. They offer a daily special for about 19 Euro pp, which includes one appetizer to share, to main courses and a dessert to share. We opted to share a Provolone cheese appetizer that was very good. It comes with provolone baked over tomatoes and a pizza like bread. I then had the stuffed tortellini with bolognese and my wife had a chicken and vegetable pasta dish. We were very happy with the food and the service, and will definitely be back. The table next to us ordered a couple of pizzas and they looked very, very good. Our bill came to about 32 Euros.

The Octopus carpaccio was great as well, but the Risotto was only ok as the richness of the risotto, the foie, and the egg created for a boring taste/texture. Would highly recommend and we will return to try other items on their menu!

We waited for about 10 minutes for a table for two when we arrived at 1030pm. Total was ?70 for two people, inclusive of the bottle of wine.

I asked about the sashimi (I've never been to a japanese restaurant where the entree came first) and was told it would be coming. and it did ... about 1.5 minutes later. Sorry but I hate when a restaurant dumps multiple plates on a table. complete lack of coordination between front and back of house as for the food ... the pork with kimchi sauce was tasty. the salmon sashimi was enormous slices (more slabs as they were pretty thick) ... a good portion at a modest price so ... go with a group ... dont be picky about things as I am ... but if you are, you might want to look elsewhere",2017-07-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d8836374-Reviews-or10-Sublime_Tokyo_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_360,0.061,0.867,0.072,0.6752,0.0540364583333333,0.4205729166666666,0.4468545454545454,1656,145,0.0875603864734299,0,76,False,56,0.1166666666666666,0.1333333333333333,0.2,0.05,0.1333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0666666666666666,0.15,0.0833333333333333,311,188,4.327974276527331,0,0,know lot peopl love place mayb problem went glitch promptli seat pretti much ignor minut someon would seem less problem one waiter tabl sever appar knew noth japanes food took forev pick want order went smoothli sake came quickli ice cold appar known overpour glass come littl high wall tray overflow glass alway appreci generos case mean glass drip place eve time halfway finish come temp let actual tast order sushi secreto iberico kimchi sauc appar korean japanes fusion tabl around serv multipl cours final first cours came except entre ask sashimi never japanes restaur entre came first told would come minut later sorri hate restaur dump multipl plate tabl complet lack coordin front back hous food pork kimchi sauc tasti salmon sashimi enorm slice slab pretti thick good portion modest price go group dont picki thing might want look elsewher,bad review,2

The experience was so enjoyable that we returned on our second night, too.

The menu contains a good range of Italian staple items. We had pasta dishes on both visits and they were freshly cooked and very tasty. And reasonably priced. The bread basket (complimentary for the first night but charged at a very modest 1 euro each on the second - I suspect now that they may have simply forgotten to charge us on the first visit) is brilliant.

We discovered Casa Lucas on our first trip and liked it so much we go there every time. The tapas are creative, complex in combinations and flavor, the ingredients are excellent, and the service is good. A previous reviewer of this restaurant scorned it solely on account of how crowded it is. It is a small and cozy place. We seek out crowded restaurants because it usually means they are good. (Not always true; not everybody is a connoisseur or there would not be Burger Kings in Madrid.) Our three visits to Casa Lucas over the past 6 years have been consistently delightful.

This is a trattoria specializing in a limited number of appetizers (the oven cooked provolone cheese with San Marzano tomato sauce as well as the mussels in a spicy tomato sauce were so amazing that a colleague and I ordered them again when we returned a few days later as a party of 8). There is variety in the pasta choices and the pasta is cooked to perfection (al dente); I particularly enjoyed the spaghetti with spicy octopus. Pizzas with quality ingredients and constituting a meal unto itself are cooked in a wood burning oven.  We also found a nice reasonable priced Primitivo red to accompany our meal.

When we realised we were running late I called them and asked could we move our booking to 10pm which was no problem at all to them, as long as we had finished by 11:30pm because that's when they close (fair enough, it was us that were running late). The restaurant is situated on a little side street just off Calle Mayor, with some tables outside and some inside. They made us feel extremely welcome, spoke good English (very rare in Madrid) and explained any questions that we had about the menu thoroughly. With it only being a small restaurant, the atmosphere was very intimate and quaint. The food was also delicious, from the pizzas to the tagliatelle, it was all very good. We had no complaints out of the 6 of us. When we had finished our meal they then served us coffees and limoncello drinks on the house. If I went back to Madrid I would definitely go back there. If you're looking for flash and brash type of restaurant then don't go, but if you're after authentic Italian cuisine and service in a quaint atmosphere then this is the place for you.

Choosing what to try is very difficult because each tapa sounds interesting and different from what one would usually eat or cook. For example we had pork cheeks in red wine sauce and lentils with duck and foie gras. There are not what you see at other tapas places. We drank wine by the glass, but bottles are available. The server was so friendly and helpful when we were trying to choose and also when I was curious about what others had ordered.

First night and we arrived at the taberna at 7.50, not realising that, in Madrid, restaurants don't usually start serving dinner until after 8pm and that they really fill up around 11pm! However, we were starving after a long day of travel and couldn't wait that long. Luckily, we were seated quickly and reassured that all but three of the tapas available were gluten-free. Gluten-free bread was quickly produced and beer was also available. My coeliac husband had the spicy beef curry and declared it amazing. It looked like slow cooked brisket to me. I had the tomato and mozzarella tower and meatballs and loved them both. The staff were lovely - the man who seated us didn't have much English (but had more English than I had Spanish!) and fetched a lovely lady to help out.

The lone server who was OUTSTANDING BTW led us downstairs after a few moments. She was lovely in speaking English with us and complimented my Spanish as well. Remarkably the dining room is downstairs and she literally ran up and down those stairs all night! Their specialty is a vermouth cocktail and of course it being August we had tinto verano which tasted much much better than the usual red wine mixed with lemon soda which we found to be too sweet. The bartender upstairs was a true mixologist and the drinks were lovely. The food was very good as well. We had an assortment of tapas and my favorite was the bresaola with parmesan tosta and the salmon with dill although we had a number of dishes and there wasn't one that I didn't care for.

We had a great table inside (I think it is 10% extra to dine outside). We only wanted a quick hearty meal, so ordered the gnocchi bolognese. It was delicious. It came out nice and hot, with a good amount of sauce for the serve.  Bread was pizza base style, with some breadsticks, not rolls or fresh bread if that is what you are after.  Prices were reasonable, but more than what you will pay for the same dish in a similar trattoria in the heart of Rome. The wine list has a range of options at reasonable prices, but I am not sure you can buy by the glass.  I'd go again if I was looking for pasta.

Half way through starter the main turned up again and we had to wait 5 minutes for second main course. Inattentive staff apart from bar waitress who could see our predicament and brought bill when it had been asked for 10 minutes previously and gave us a complimentary Limoncello which was the nicest part of the otherwise poor experience.

This small and simply appointed restaurant has a great staff - knowledgeable, friendly and attentive, but the reason to go there is the food. We found on later trips that this is certainly a top choice in Madrid for tapas, but that first evening we learned that this is THE place to go for really fine dining. Simple, authentic and delicious! Their food, while not necessarily historically authentic are certainly both creative and consistent with the spirit of the traditional foods of Spain. Their wine list is sufficient to satisfy. They have made two interesting choices of which the visitor should be aware. First, beverage choices are limited to wine, water, juices, coffee or tea. The serve no soft drinks. Second, they offer no desserts.

Then, I must also recommend the pinchos, which are large here. Get the mancha, a vegetable pisto covered with a quail egg and crispy Jamón strips, and the one with the solomillo, in this case a grilled piece of pork loin atop caramelized onions. My husband also loved the Madrid pincho, an omelette of morcilla that I must admit was delicious, despite my involuntary queasiness with respect to blood sausage. As always, the tuna tataki was a delight. Yes, it's pricier than the other places on the cava Baja and throughout Madrid in general, but it's always good.

It's just a door into a small bar area that looks to hold about 9 people at most with stairs leading down to a lower level where there are a half dozen tables. If you suffer from celiac this place has to be on your list to visit. We arrived on a Sunday night about 7:30 pm, there were a couple people at the bar and lady behind the bar promptly greeted us and spoke English much better than we spoke Spanish. She directed us to lower level and when we mentioned we were 'celiacos' she was able to provide us with a gluten free menu in English and also pointed out a few items that could be made GF on the main menu. We ordered 4 tapas, a cheese plate, a pork in three cheese sauce, meatballs, and beef in a spicy red curry. They were all served with GF bread and were very flavorful. My personal favorite was the beef in the spicy red curry sauce, while my wife preferred the pork in a 3 cheese sauce. Overall they were all delicious. One of the highlights I will admit was a good tasting Gluten Free Beer. The lady behind the bar was friendly and efficient. She really took care of us and we will definitely stop there again.

Decor is tiny but quaint - just enough to fit roughly 20-30 people. We were probably the only tourists in the restaurant but didn't get any evil eye look from the local patrons. We got lucky and grabbed a table within minutes of arrival. Our server was also very friendly and pleasant. This place is definitely not on the tourists' map but I'd imagine people will soon catch wind of it.  A small charcuterie and bread was given to us for free upon taking our seat, a pretty usual service of tapa joints. Even though this first tapa was free, the meat was just so flavorful. Our food blogs suggested the dish to try is their calamari with squid ink mayo. It's on the pricy side but it's well worth it's taste in pennies! This has got to be our dish in Madrid! I was telling our server that this dish tasted even better than the traditional ""bocadillo"" (calamari) sandwich the locals eat. He promptly agreed.  I wished I had taken a better photo of the squid ink dish. It arrived with whole pieces of calamari ""tied together"" with bacon with the squid ink mayo sauce separately in one corner. Before I had he chance, the server proceed to cut up the calamari and combining all the ingredients at table side.

The Argentine waiter was friendly and attentive, ensuring we didn't overdo it on the ordering and offering half portions as well. The tuna tataki was devoured - nicely (and unusually) paired with apple sauce. The oxtail was tasty although I'd have preferred one or two pieces as a appetiser rather than four as a main (so a good half portion choice?). The octopus carpaccio was nicely presented and served with deconstructed chorizo - lots of paprika and bacon bits.

We were received by who seemed to be the owner of the restaurant. He was a lovely gentleman very chatty and welcoming. We were sat at our table and asked if we needed to use the restroom which, whoever knows me, I am in need of one very often. It was neat, clean and nicely decorated.  Due to Covid we were offered to look up the menus by scanning the QR but also were offered the normal menu if we found that easier which was nice of them, but my sister and I decided to go the easy way and simply scan the menu. Everything sounded so appetising that it was very hard to choose from all the options available!  While deciding what to have they kindly brought us olives, tomato dressed with salt and a peculiar but tasty olive oil and small chistorras (typical sausages from Spain). All three of them were really nice. After deliberation, we decided to share Iberian ham croquettes and goat cheese with with glazed honey, grapes and truffle. The starters were quality. The bechamel sauce was smooth and light and very tasty, the goat cheese with truffle was simply amazing. I love the contrast of a strong sour flavour mixed with the sweet flavour of honey and grapes and the truffle gave that special touch. It was absolutely delicious.  As a main I went for the beef cheeks which I had been craving for months. I even had dreamt about them! They came accompanied by boiled potatoes and carrot and an absolutely gorgeous sauce. It was so tender that it melt in my mouth. Cooked to perfection and delicious. I also ordered a red wine house from Navarra to go with it. The combination of both was really good and I enjoyed it a lot. To finish with, I went for the chocolate coulant that came with chocolate crumbs and vanilla ice cream. I also had the pleasure of tasting the Torrija (fried bread) which was to my surprise even better than the coulant. Dressed with some custard sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect end to a perfect meal. I also tried peaches from Navarra. And let me say that they were lovely too. Not too soft, not too hard, very rich and tasty.  Throughout the meal the whole staff was so nice and attentive, very professional and friendly. I love good manners and good service. The pleases, the thank yous, the clearing from the left, serving from the right, clearing the crumbs in between courses, pouring the drinks when needed, changing the cutlery for fresh ones, the details, the warnings to let you know what's coming, the pauses, the caring for the customer and their experience. That's what I felt during my meal.  The ambience of the restaurant was nice too. If you ever go to Madrid I totally recommend them, not only for the service provided but the food was outstanding.

We travel frequently and dine regularly at Michelin - starred restaurants, so believe us when we share this incredible evening’s warm and welcoming experience. Upon arrival, the sweet owner greeted us and explained the menu. Feeling a bit overwhelmed with all of the delicious options, she returned and suggested some great shared plates, drawing from the freshest/favorites of the menu options. (Highlighted at this restaurant are beautifully sourced vegetables from Azagra in northern Spain.) After we had ordered a nice bottle of viognier to share, they delivered lovely crusty bread, accompanied by perfectly seasoned tomatoes and a side of sausages. We can definitely recommend the leeks topped with micro greens, spicy grilled red peppers, artichokes and thistles ( think celery) which were all shared and enjoyed. The grilled monk fish and lamb stew  for entrees were also exceptional. The meal was so well - paced, that we even decided to share a delectable dessert of carmelized, cream -filled French toast accompanied with vanilla bean ice cream. Over chamomille tea and complimentary pirouettes, our gracious hostess treated us to a sweet dessert wine that was the perfect end to a remarkable meal.

We messaged the owner of the apartment we were at and asked if he had a suggestion for lunch. He suggested here. Once we walked in, we almost turned around and walked out. Everyone was in suits and dresses. We were in jeans and had a backpack. But they made us feel very welcome. I think it was the owner (if she wasn't the owner, she should have been!) came and discussed the menu with us and helped us with our choices. And then we sat back and had the best meal I think I've ever had in Spain. After we had worked on the menu, a wine from Navarre was suggested to go with it. And then it started with fresh bread with olive oil (from Navarre), some tomatoes with a sprinkle of salt and some sausages.  I started with Gazpacho made with fresh tomatoes, grapes and blackberries. Best I have had in my life! And I've had quite a few! My husband had Huevos fritos con pimientos del cristal (red peppers roasted on a grill with fried eggs). We would have never thought to put this together but it was so delicious! And then we had suckling pig with fresh veggies for our main. Just absolutely amazing. At the end they brought us a small drink also from Navarre and I really wish I could remember the name. When she was describing it to us, she said it was like a Slow Gin.  I am SO happy that we didn't walk out when we saw how people were dressed. Everyone made us feel very welcome.

The blood sausage was not as expected - rather than being served in a link, it was removed from the casing and spread across a toasted slice of bread in a paste like fashion. Perhaps they were going for a different interpretation? The soy chicken was very salty. Wouldn't order either again. The hospitality, however, speaks volumes. A wonderful experience on a tapas filled night!",2013-12-29,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1822624-Reviews-or310-Casa_Lucas-Madrid.html,UID_24860,0.05,0.777,0.173,0.9622,0.0466666666666666,0.5533333333333333,0.4980636363636364,798,64,0.0802005012531328,1,22,False,26,0.125,0.125,0.2083333333333333,0.0833333333333333,0.125,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.0833333333333333,0.0833333333333333,0.0833333333333333,137,107,4.824817518248175,0,0,love stop night dedic adventur tapa hop madrid reserv saturday night manag squeez inch space avail bar atmospher definit welcom night end two complimentari glass cava non spanish speaker menu english translat pleasur food hate say mediocr blood sausag expect rather serv link remov case spread across toast slice bread past like fashion perhap go differ interpret soy chicken salti order either hospit howev speak volum wonder experi tapa fill night,average review,3

The restaurant is extremely small and we sat in the corner at a small table (with an admittedly uncomfortable chair). But the food was phenomenal -- the tastes were unique, creative and delicious. We had the marinated chicken with corn soufflé -- superb; the chicken couscous was excellent; my husband talked about the sauce on the seafood pasta for days.

However, our evening was ruined when, prior to having dessert, we were told that we had to vacate our table in five minutes. We (a party of four) had arrived at 9.30pm and this was at 10.55pm. Apparently, they had another reservation booked for 11.00pm. The booking had been made via the internet and there was no indication that we only had the table for 1 1/2 hours, nor were we advised of this when we arrived. Into the bargain, restrictions on the amount of time you have a table are quite common in New York and, to a certain extent, in London but it's unheard of in Madrid... or at least among our party of ex-patriots each of whom had lived in the city around 20 years! (This is one of the reasons why I like living in Spain.) What was additionally annoying was that although the restaurant was busy (it was the last Friday before Christmas) there were still a couple of table free and some sensible floor management would have meant that those people who had booked a table could be accommodated without the inconvenience to my party. If you only want one (or two) courses and a quick meal then perhaps this is a place to go;  if you want a long convivial evening with a medium-sized group, then avoid! Into the bargain, when checking the bill, a couple of (admittedly small) extra items ended u on it that were not ordered. On principal, after the brusque way we were treated, I will not be returning here.

Well, we certainly didn't regret it. Nor did we feel guilty! We enjoyed our meal here so much we had to go back a second time to make sure it wasn't a fluke the first time. The pizza was as authentic as one could hope for. (Not just in the way it was made/cooked but perhaps because the ingredients were also first class). Same could be said for the pasta dishes.The White Truffle pasta was heady and incredibly aromatic. And the Pasta alla Norma was a bit of a revelation. (We were so bowled over we actually tried to replicate this when we got back to London). The wine list was also excellent bearing in mind that this is a trattoria and by no means 'top-end' posh place. Hence the prices were very reasonable indeed including wines (which were close to normal, affordable retail prices unlike those in London which are generally marked up by a whopping 250%!) Service was very good and super prompt. Food arrived in good time and piping hot. The noise level wasn't too high either which meant even when it was rather busy one could still have a conversation without having to raise one's voice. Booking ahead is certainly advisable as this is understandably a popular place! I wish there were more places like this in London (which is usually a rip-off when it comes to dining at this level ).

Apparently, the owner is the son of Casa Lucio right across the street. We waited for a table for about 10 minutes but were served delicious Ribero wine with small plates of dried meats and bread. We planned on ordering about 6 tapas but the waiter stopped us after 3 and said that might enough. We appreciated it because the truth was it was more than enough. We had three amazing dishes. The highlight was the duck foie gras. It was amazing. It's tiny but worth the visit. At one point it got very hot and without our asking they raised the temperature of the AC. The wait staff was very nice and after making friends with the couple next to us we stayed for another hour just talking. They never asked us to leave. Very nice. Love this place.

They make recipes from Navarra (Northern Spain) where quality is always the main goal. Excellent vegetables cooked to the precise point, that they receive from their home village daily, fine meats and the best fresh fish of every season. Service can´t be better, kind, helpful and friendly. Nice and minimalistic venue that will make you feel comfortable. Many famous people are among their customers : former King of Spain, forme vice-president of the USA, politicians, sport stars, etc. But they give every customer the same loving care.

The staff were generally pleasant and the chef and his wife were delightful. His English is nonexistent so he found another person to help with our order. While the meal was excellent (although the artichoke starter seemed under seasoned and perhaps overlooked) the high point was the dessert that the owner's wife suggested - Torrija caramelizada - a type of ""French toast"" but that name doesn't do it justice. It was one of the top 5 desserts either of us has ever had. I need to find out how to make it! And then we were given complementary glasses of Pacharan, an aperitif from Navarra.

I have spent several weeks in Madrid over the past year, specifically on or very near Cava Baja and the appeal of Case Lucas escapes me, especially with SO many other options nearby. I've been there three times now, thinking perhaps I was missing something, as there is so much love for this place among TripAdvisor reviewers. I had the same reaction on this past visit. It's okay. Nothing more. The servers are very pleasant but the room is totally without charm. The food is nice though not fantastic nor worth the higher cost, compared to other local places. Poor (again, compared to other places on the street and elsewhere in Madrid) freebies when ordering drinks. Decent selection of wines but, again, nothing unique or even out of the ordinary. So, I don't see the need to try again. Of course, for those of my fellow travelers who love it, wonderful. Glad you enjoy it.

Every night, depending on season and harvest, they have specials that are usually the stars of the night.

Our daughter's friend came with her newborn baby, and the wait staff was very gracious about accommodating her. The staff is very attentive. We tried a couple of tapas to share at the start, and we liked them all. One was a veggie dish. Two of us had fish dishes as our main courses; salmon and sea bass. I had the sea bass, and it was my least favorite dish. It was poached I believe, and was not cooked in the garlic, olive oil, and other spices I had hoped for. I would try something else next time, although the fish itself was good. Just a bit bland.  They also have nice wines by the glass.

The restaurant is beautiful, with white tablecloths and napkins, all tables elegantly arrayed. It was truly a Sunday European long lunch, with excellent service and quiet attentiveness from the staff.   We ordered artichokes, anchovies, grilled bell peppers, sauteed leeks (amazingly cooked-they just melted in your mouth). Fresh monkfish, red tuna grilled, and oxtail with mushrooms.  Just listing the food does not do it justice. Each plate was cooked just right. Service paced our eating, the wine was superb - and thus, the day proceeded at a leisurely pace, with good friends and good food and good wine.  This is truly an exceptionally good restaurant, with standards maintained proudly. By the time we left, all of the staff lined up to shake our hands and wish us well.

When I was looking for a special restaurant for a friend who was celebrating her birthday in Madrid, I came across this restaurant. It was a delight.  It is difficult to find restaurants anywhere that provide vegetables the respect that they deserve. And, La Manduca de Azagra is a prize restaurants for anyone looking for the perfect vegetable experience. Michelin guide also agrees. Plus, the vegetables are from one of the best food and wine regions of Spain, Navarra. Our menu consisted of fresh asparagas, crystal red peppers, artichokes (fried and boiled), and pochas (white beans that have been picked just before they fully mature).

We loved it so much, that we had to bring our daughter on a recent visit to Madrid. Not only is the quality of the food superbly fresh and well prepared, but the owner/hostess is the warmest and most caring person. She comes to your table and tells you which vegetables are the freshest for the night and highlights recommended menu items. A delicious tomato salad and yummy little sausages were brought as an amuse bouche. The gazpacho made with tomato, grapes and berries was SUBLIME, both in texture and flavor. White asparagus, prepared simply to let the asparagus shine, melted in your mouth. Sauteed artichokes and white beans were also delicious. Three of us shared the sirloin steak which was also perfectly prepared and DELICOUS. (Just a note, medium in Spain is what we in the US call medium/rare) Chocolate souffle was good, but the real star was the torija...like the lightest french toast filled with a creme bulee and carmelized sugar coating...outrageously good!

The owners take great care and pride to welcome you personally and explain the menu in detail. They and their staff are attentive throughout whilst at the same time not intruding.

I liked the menu for its traditional Navarra recipes, although I do not eat much meat and was concerned that it might be difficult to choose something I thought I would enjoy. The owners are clearly very involved with the customers. Annabelle, who speaks very good English, explained many of the dishes to us and recommended that we have half portions of some of the dishes so we could try more flavours and also wine to accompany the meal. The vegetable dishes we tried - artichoke, thistle, red peppers and borage were delicious. We both chose fish as our main course. My tuna was cooked exactly as I asked and seasoned perfectly. My husband chose cod in tomatoes and rated it 8/10. The restaurant is unpretentious and the owners are clearly very proud of the food and wine they offer. I would wholeheartedly recommend it.

I don't remember her mane but she explain about the restaurant and the food and each ingredient, where it came from and how they make it, what is special in the ingredients and ask me what do I prefer or if I don't want or like something.  She listen very carefully and understand what I like or don't like and then she offer me the things she think I'd like.   I can tell you guys, she scored it, everything I ate was soooooo good :) The food was amazing and the cooking style was fabulous to me, It took me back 20-30 years to my childhood.

As a testament to its popularity, dinners at the restaurant were booked out for the next 2 days. We found out why! The reception, from my phone reservation to the welcome upon arrival, was warm and sincere. Seated near the front of the room, I observed the arrival of diners and formed the distinct impression that many, if not all, were regulars. This was a great sign!  Annabelle the co-proprietress guided us through the menu and suggested sharing 3 typical Navarran vegetable dishes. The presentation was unfussy; the focus entirely on the freshness of the ingredients. The grilled suckling pig was heavenly, as was the ox tail stew. Paired with a ripe 2007 Luis Canas, it proved to be an excellent meal. Coffee, dessert and complimentary shots of liqueur prolonged our dinner experience and ensured that our table was a single sitting for the evening.

No way is there 100 better places to eat. We ate here on recommendation from the Spanish consulate in the city where we live was not disappointed. We often eat at Michelin starred restaurants and the food here was equally as good as a 1 star but without alot of the fuss that goes with Michelin restaurants. We were only in Madrid for one night but would of definitely gone back had we been for longer. The Restaurant is really top notch, very modern but still with an rustic feel. The tables were positioned excellently, the atmosphere was fantastic, not to loud but a really nice vibrant buzz, we were there on a Thursday in February and there wasn't one spare table so booking is highly advisable.  The food was amazing. Great choice of meat dishes, fish and great spanish style starters. It is spanish but without being to spanish. I had the sea bass and it was the best fish Ive ever had, perfectly cooked and very fresh. They also have a great selection of vegetable dishes (which i generally find hard to find in Spain). More fine dining food with a small spanish twist we felt. The wine list was very good, good selection of spanish wines at very good price. We had a bottle of alion 2009 and it wasn't marked up much in price from what you can buy in shops yourself. The temperature of the red wine was perfect, you could tell it had been stored correctly in a cellar or temperature controlled wine fridge.

Most places were very busy so we continued walking and then came across this place (unfortunately ;() The staff just ignored us to begin with and we were left standing like silly beggars whilst they saw to others who arrived after us (I assume they were locals). Eventually we were seated. Ordered glass of white wine and a beer. Bread on the table didn't seem fresh but that's my opinion. We ordered a starter of cheese and meats for 20 euro and I asked the waiter if this was enough for 2 of us, he said it was then asked if we wanted more??? The language barrier was too much so we didn't bother ordering anything else. The cheese and meats were poor and we only got 3 small pieces of cheese. Defo not worth the price or a visit.

We were roaming the area for a place to eat late one evening and we stumbled upon this restaurant. We didn't have a reservation and were a tad underdressed for such a posh atmosphere but the staff instantly put us at ease. The decor was simple and minimalistic that was in some way reminiscent of being in a contemporary art museum like the Tate Modern. Yet, the service was so hospitable that it made us feel as though we were in someone's dining room in the countryside of Navarre. And the food was simply outstanding. The artichokes were a bit salty but the rest was awesome including the solomillo. The motto of the restaurant is ""Welcome home, consider it yours"" and they hold true to that.

We do not eat meat, which severely narrowed the choices available at many Spanish restaurants. Nonetheless, La Manduca was consistently rated as superior on Trip Advisor, so we decided to take a chance. We were the first patrons to arrive at the restaurant at 21:15. Anabelle, one of the owners, warmly guided us through the menu, in English. She chose the wine for us, and it was very good. Several fish entrees and vegetable first courses made our selection easy. Desert was scrumptious as well. The food was wonderful from start to finish. Annabelle took great care of us throughout the whole meal, as if we were guests in her home.  By the time we finished our meal, the restaurant was packed with diners, many of whom clearly were regular customers. With more people arriving for dinner, we left at 23:30 after a thoroughly top notch meal and cultural experience. Annabelle, personally hailed the cab for us to return to our hotel.

We were greeted and welcomed by the owner and seated in a lovely table in a very nice dining room. The lighting is subdued (but not too subdued) and the tables spaced so that one can enjoy a quiet conversation in peace. We noticed that most of the other diners were 'suits' (business people). The food focused on very good produce and home grown vegetables. The artichokes were a revelation. We have never enjoyed artichokes before, they look good but usually taste of... nothing much. These artichokes were prepared in a way that brought out the most amazing flavours. All the food is delicious. Often 'respect for the produce' ends up with dishes that are just plain, unadorned, and 'features' not particularly skilled cooking. Here they transform the produce with some kind of alchemy to make it into something transcendent. We had an excellent lunch and just loved the restaurant. Our jaws dropped when we got the bill - we thought it incredibly reasonable for the quality. Wow, bill shock in reverse. That was a first for us. We were given a heartfelt farewell and even a hug by the owner's wife. Wonderful food, excellent service, beautiful calm surroundings, one of the best experiences we had in Madrid.

We popped into the busy Casa Lucas around 9 without a reservation, had a drink at the bar and within 30 minutes we were seated and looking at the English menu. We had one of the most special meals we have ever had. We liked it so much we made a reservation for the next night as it was our last night in Spain, we were heading back to Australia. We wanted a guaranteed great last meal in wonderful Spain. So 24 hours later we were greeted with a familiar smile, a shake of the hand by the barman and the lovely waitress who greeted us the night before. We tried something different, and it was equally stunning. There is no point in recommending any one particular dish as they are ALL DELICIOUS. What made these two nights particularly special were the two marvellous hosts who made us feel like we were the most important customers they have ever had.

We found this Taberna when we were googling gluten free dining in Madrid. It is was a real treat, for someone who is gluten intolerant like myself. There was also a menu for my partner who is has no problem with gluten.  The woman serving us was absolutely delightful. I assume from other reviews she was the owner. She was attentive to her customers, but exuded an enthusiasm for her work and the quality of the food. The menu offered choices of nearly 30 different culinary delights. The memorable dishes for us were duck with orange, anchovies with pesto and cheese, salmon salad. The unexpected bonus dessert tapas at the end characterised the thought and consideration that management has given to giving its customers a great experience. This Taberna has been one the outstanding dining experiences of our trip to Madrid this year, and we will return a couple of more times before we leave.

Most venues tell you they don't have any option (even if they serve meat, for example). Few welcome you with a dedicated menu (or an allergens listing).  Anyway, this restaurant has great food, and a dedicated Gluten-free English menu, which is almost identical to the regular menu. Tapas was tasty, arrived fast, and service was very good and considerate. And in English! Only problem is that it is a small place, so better book ahead (A must during the weekend). The room downstairs is very nicely decorated.

As one of the first restaurants that my partner and I ate at on our trip to Spain, the dining experience served as a wonderful welcome!  To start, I have to follow a very strict gluten, soy, and corn free diet so eating out can be challenging and stressful. Any concerns regarding cross contamination were quickly alleviated by the “Sin Gluten” decal on the door, indicating that the staff has been trained and certified in proper GF kitchen procedures by the Associacion de Celiacos. Gluten challenged diners can feast here completely confident that they will not be glutened and that, in and of itself, is a joy for me! However, an even more delightful dimension of our dining experience was the extraordinary, accommodating service by our extremely friendly waitress, Beatriz! She warmly welcomed us into the restaurant and then cheerfully took on the challenge of finding foods within my eating restrictions and preferences! While almost all of the items on the menu were possible to have GF with just a bread switch, soy and corn posed a problem within my initial choices. Beatriz worked diligently to find not only safe but tasty creations! Beatriz seemed as happy as I was when she was able to generate three different tapas: one cheese, one anchovy and tomato, and one with lentils and caramelized duck! They were absolutely delicious with their house vino tinto!  This understated, casual tapas bar may not be grand in its size or physical appearance but it is truly special in its people and approach to food. Menu item combinations were more creative than the typical tapas bar. Highly recommended for GF and non GF diners alike!",2015-12-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3470895-Reviews-or270-Taberna_la_Concha-Madrid.html,UID_25161,0.03,0.787,0.183,0.9934,0.4048664736164736,0.6787194337194338,0.3526230769230769,1730,134,0.0774566473988439,9,29,False,51,0.0666666666666666,0.2166666666666666,0.35,0.0333333333333333,0.1333333333333333,0.0333333333333333,0.0166666666666666,0.05,0.0666666666666666,0.0333333333333333,294,199,4.880952380952381,0,0,la concha charm littl tapa bar fill upbeat spirit delici food one first restaur partner ate trip spain dine experi serv wonder welcom start follow strict gluten soy corn free diet eat challeng stress concern regard cross contamin quickli allevi sin gluten decal door indic staff train certifi proper gf kitchen procedur associacion de celiaco gluten challeng diner feast complet confid gluten joy howev even delight dimens dine experi extraordinari accommod servic extrem friendli waitress beatriz warmli welcom us restaur cheer took challeng find food within eat restrict prefer almost item menu possibl gf bread switch soy corn pose problem within initi choic beatriz work dilig find safe tasti creation beatriz seem happi abl gener three differ tapa one chees one anchovi tomato one lentil caramel duck absolut delici hous vino tinto underst casual tapa bar may grand size physic appear truli special peopl approach food menu item combin creativ typic tapa bar highli recommend gf non gf diner alik,good review,4

The young owner- head chef Javi Estévez offers a very interesting and innovative mix of street food and old style Spanish dishes with almost forgotten offal elements. The local tavern style ground floor dining room has minimalist wooden interior and two big windows with natural light. There were two tasting menus at 50 Euro and 70 Euro as well as an a la carte choice. The meal has begun with appetisers, beef tongue, olives and sourdough bread with olive oil. We have ordered few dishes from the a la carte option. We started with a beef tongue and lobster salad, for second course we had tacos with beef tongue and lobster and third course brioche with roasted lamb and wild mushroom. The salad was very pleasant and refreshing, the tacos were very enjoyable, the beef tong had good flavour and was nicely cooked. The brioche dish had rich flavours, the lamb and the wild mushroom were gently cooked, they went well together. The place was very busy but the staff was attentive, our waitress was friendly and helpful.

I was drawn to El Camoati because it was an Argentinean restaurant, and we love Argentinean food. On arrival we were warmly greeted and shown to our table. The interior design is very quirky, and we were made to feel very comfortable. Other than drinks - a tinto de verano for me and a G&T for my husband, we chose the steak with paprika potatoes and sweet carrots. This was very filling and we had no room for dessert!

We chose one of the marble 'sewing machine' tables, with the red velvet coverings on the long seated bench and the soft lighting, together with Lady in Red by Chris de Burgh crooning in the background I was joking about it being the perfect place to go for a date! :-) Whilst we were still chatting and going through the menu (which also has an English section towards the back) the waitress brought us over a complimentary dish - kind of like a flatbread with chutney. My friend ordered red wine and I had been going for two weeks straight on Dry January but I ended up caving in. We split the salmon tartare/mango starter (amazing, and so different to other food I'd had in Spain) and both went for pasta dishes for main course. In fact the food was so good and we were so hungry that we didn't take any photos, but lots of have been posted by other reviewers already. Was so tempted to stay for dessert but we decided to go check out the nearby bars instead! For somewhere that felt like fine dining, the prices were very reasonable.

The chef owner has innovative dishes and keeps the favourites on the menu - with a good mix of spanish, Mediterranean and more exotic dishes. The other owner chooses good wines at reasonable prices.

La Tragantua is a small restaurant but offers a nice homely feeling when dining. I strongly recommend booking a table as this will get full quickly, not just tourists but also locals which speaks volumes about the quality of food here. Whilst the resturant was full people were still coming in to enquire when a table would be available.  The staff and service was top notch very friendly and efficient, the menu was explained to us in english, very helpful indeed.  The food is excellent and good value.

In general it is a very good restaurant - nice atmosphere like in a private location and good food. 10 dishes which were tasty. The chef was very friendly.  Unfortunately we also had some bad experiences. We all do not speak Spanish and we only had Spanish speaking waitresses, which is our problem, but was a pity as we were never sure of what the dish consists. As the restaurant has no menu, not even in Spanish, we never had a clue what was served. I was very disappointed when we found out at the end of the evening, that there was one English speaking waitress. Why did she not change table with her colleague to serve us? An absolute no go happened with the wine. The chef recommended a white wine and we took a bottle. Sadly we had cork in our wine glasses, what can happen, so we asked for a new bottle. But the waitress poured the wine through a filter in a decanter, which is intolerable. And on top of that our white wine was left in the decanter unchilled the whole evening - this is not acceptable and a disaster for a restaurant in this price range / category.",2019-06-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12608132-Reviews-Arrayan-Madrid.html,UID_25290,0.135,0.807,0.058,-0.9675,0.0316193181818181,0.4954208754208755,0.5576923076923077,1145,121,0.1056768558951965,0,25,False,47,0.1269841269841269,0.1111111111111111,0.1904761904761904,0.0476190476190476,0.1746031746031746,0.0634920634920634,0.0476190476190476,0.0634920634920634,0.0952380952380952,0.0793650793650793,217,136,4.276497695852535,0,0,easter weekend parent law gener good restaur nice atmospher like privat locat good food dish tasti chef friendli unfortun also bad experi speak spanish spanish speak waitress problem piti never sure dish consist restaur menu even spanish never clue serv disappoint found end even one english speak waitress chang tabl colleagu serv us absolut go happen wine chef recommend white wine took bottl sadli cork wine glass happen ask new bottl waitress pour wine filter decant intoler top white wine left decant unchil whole even accept disast restaur price rang categori,bad review,2

I enjoy the location, service and atmosphere - the food is usually pretty good too. They are sympathetic to people with children and can handle large groups. I was there yesterday and they have excellent looking desserts too. I have to admit I ordered badly - when the food arrived I had expected something else. They kindly didn't charge me for the dish which in my opinion was inedible - I appreciated that very much, although I was more than prepared to pay as it was my fault for ordering it in the first place. My suggestion is to describe the dishes with more detail. When I read on the menu 'cod with emulsion of black olives' I did not picture an almost raw cold slab of fish on a bed of grey paste surrounded by a lot of cold olive oil and a copious quantity of balsamic emulsion (I hate this stuff, which is often applied liberally to dishes in Spain in a decorative way, and ruins them) topped with onion sprouts and black sesame. I asked them to take the fish off the sauce bed and cook it some more, which they did but when it came back it was still undercooked and the overpowering flavour of the onion sprouts was all wrong. They were kind to take it away, but as my friends dishes had arrived much before mine anyway, by the time all this had happened they had finished their food, so I didn't eat! I am not unhappy as these things sometimes happen. What I would suggest is that they listen to constructive criticism - I don't have a restaurant but I do know food and your dish is over embellished with a strange flavour combination. Also, no-one wants anything grey on their plate. Please don't tell a customer that no-one else has ever not liked it and it's your number one dish - I seriously doubt this but anyway, what's that got to do with anything?",2019-05-12,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3200440-Reviews-Taberna_Rayuela-Madrid.html,UID_25293,0.071,0.835,0.094,0.7033,0.0878670403670403,0.5370400895400896,0.628676923076923,1880,182,0.0968085106382978,1,43,False,58,0.1012658227848101,0.1392405063291139,0.1772151898734177,0.0126582278481012,0.1772151898734177,0.050632911392405,0.0253164556962025,0.050632911392405,0.1518987341772152,0.1139240506329113,354,204,4.313559322033898,0,0,go restaur year mostli near hous use live six year enjoy locat servic atmospher food usual pretti good sympathet peopl children handl larg group yesterday excel look dessert admit order badli food arriv expect someth els kindli charg dish opinion ined appreci much although prepar pay fault order first place suggest describ dish detail read menu cod emuls black oliv pictur almost raw cold slab fish bed grey past surround lot cold oliv oil copiou quantiti balsam emuls hate stuff often appli liber dish spain decor way ruin top onion sprout black sesam ask take fish sauc bed cook came back still undercook overpow flavour onion sprout wrong kind take away friend dish arriv much mine anyway time happen finish food eat unhappi thing sometim happen would suggest listen construct critic restaur know food dish embellish strang flavour combin also one want anyth grey plate pleas tell custom one els ever like number one dish serious doubt anyway got anyth,bad review,2

The welcome was warm (although I'm sure it helped that one of our party had been there before) and the vibe was informal. Our food selections included prawns with garlic and chilli, salmon on skewers, patatas bravas, pork cheeks and croquettes stuffed with mushroom. All with robust flavours. Our crusty bread was put to good use soaking up the tasty sauces. We also sampled an excellent Alborino (white Rioja) and a good red Rioja. Great value for money. We left completely satisfied.

Small and cosy, we felt like we were in a local favourite - just what we were looking for. Alex, our waiter, was fantastic! He talked us through in English, made some great recommendations (definitely go for the garlic prawns and the patatas bravas) and looked after us throughout. The barman made great cocktails and we were thrilled with the little shot of digestif after the meal that was given to us. We also ordered the salmon and avocado salad and we were a bit disappointed not to find any avocado in it ... we could've said something but they were getting pretty busy so we just left it.

Really easy to get to from the palace, just turn right walk down the road over the bridge and it's the first turning on the left. We slipped in, and were greeted by very friendly staff who were considerate and always smiling the whole time.  The menu and food were so good we had our main feed of the day there! Everything we had tasted great, and they even serve locally brewed Brabante craft beer. We popped in fairly close to the end of their lunch opening but they didn't once look as if they were trying to move us along.
