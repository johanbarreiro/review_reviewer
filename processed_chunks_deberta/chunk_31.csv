Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by Alex and shown to a cozy corner table. He asked us how we were doing, where we were from, and was very friendly and welcoming. He suggested we try the sangria as it was a house specialty. We agreed and we're glad we did as it was delicious. For our meal we decided to try some different tapas from the menu. We asked Alex about sizes and quantity and he suggested starting with a few different half portions so that we could try several different dishes. We ordered the Salmorejo soup (served cold), the endive/goat cheese/walnut salad, the curry chicken (served with rice) and the shredded steak (ropa de viejo) served with thinly sliced potatoes. Every dish was delicious and after each bite we were saying ""mmmmm""! This is no lie. We were in Spain for 2 weeks, and this was by far our favourite meal and restaurant in Madrid. After we finished our dinner, Alex asked us if we'd like any dessert. He showed us the options and had us sold on the passionfruit cheesecake. OMG, it was sooooo good!! Everything we ate was superb and the service was top notch. If you are in Madrid and want an easy, laid back atmosphere with great food, and very friendly staff, not to mention very reasonably priced (our whole meal including 2 very large glasses of sangria, 4 tapas dishes, bread basket, and dessert) was only $29 euros in total), then El Sur should be #1 on your list.

I ordered the menu del dia which came with a huge starter of the most delicious mushroom and chicken risotto, which I followed with a main dish of fresh Salmon in Yogurt sauce and salad. It was soooo good! Next was dessert. In my other experiences, the postre that comes with the menu is small and plain (vanilla ice cream/ chocolate pudding).... well not at this place. You had a choice between a generous slice of chocolate, carrot, or red velvet cakes or two different types of cheese cake. Did I mention that this was all for about 10 euro? Not only was the food to die for, but the staff was super friendly.

We went with the smallest of the menus, the flow of the food and plates was very smooth and nicely done, all dishes prepared meticulously and food very good and above average, but not sure its worth a Michelin star.  The building is old style and definitely I feel the interior could use a refreshing as it feels old and stale. I would say the low point was service. While it was never lacking, at the beginning we were attended by one waiter who gave you the idea they would be with you all evening, that same waiter only appeared twice during the 3 hours we were there, the rest of the time there was a lot of changing between the waiters and in the particular room we were in (only table in the room) it was noticeable and personally did not like the constant movement of waiters as it distracted from discussion at the table...

We ate at this place on our first and last nights while in Madrid. I had done my homework before departing the states to Madrid. The restaurant was on our radar. So glad we ate here. The steak was tender, juicy, and very flavorful. The basket of bread was an awesome treat of different types of bread - fresh and tasty. Very good selection of wines, and especially in the moderate range. Most importantly, the staff were all professional, accommodating, and attentive without crowding. The Restaurants provides a complimentary glass of bubbly and a bisque when seated. They also provide a couple of mini-deserts including sorbet. It's those little pieces of recognition that give this restaurant the extra bonus over other restaurants. The second night we had the steak again and added the grilled chicken. That chicken was amazing! No one can accuse this restaurant of using inferior chickens or meat. The flavors told of its freshness. I don't recall the sauce that came with the chicken, but it wasn't heavy or overbearing.

I loved it. This isn't a meal, it's food as theatre. So imaginative, every tiny dish leaves you a) wondering how they did it and b) wishing there was just a tiny bit more. La pezera, a little fishbowl of a dessert, was so good I nearly wept, while there were other courses that made us spontaneously smile. Everyone talks about the mini Babybel and the poached egg, but I think this is just because they are easy to describe -- there were other dishes I liked better. At the end of the meal we were each given a little scroll listing what we'd eaten, with the wine pairings -- a nice touch, as I'd been taking photos of every dish in order to keep track. For me it's probably a once in a lifetime experience. I have only paid this much for a meal (about 300 euros for two) on two other occasions -- Lapeyrouse in Paris and Michel Bras at Laguiole. Both meals were superb, but left me feeling guilty about spending so much money on a single meal. This experience surpassed both of those.

Very simple decoration, all white and grey, with nice music in the background. On the food front, it is a typical modern fusion place - you just choose between three menus (differentiated by number of dishes going from 8 --2 pre starters, 2 starters, a fish, a meat and few desserts-- to 15) and after usual inquiry about allergies here goes a festival of small tasting portions It was both delicious and interesting (ok, sometimes more interesting that delicious but in any case worth trying). The menu changes every season, so by the time you are here it might be different but I had: - mayonnaise mousse to be eaten with what looks like a paper card but turns out to be made out of potato (more interesting than delicious) - small bread with garlic butter - foie gras with truffle game mousse and eucalyptus wind ! - amazing camembert babybel with truffles - caviar, turnip flake, cauliflower cream  - mizo soup with white fish sashimi, very tasty and good After those pre starters, actual starters were: - delicious vegetable soup served in plastic bag ! - a never changing dish, an egg in thin slice of toasted bread served with some pancetta - smoked salmon throat (sic !) with coconut air (re-sic !!!) followed by two mains: - halibut belly with citrus air (!) (and actually the 'air' is really tasty) - lamb with pistachio (amazing & melting !) and then by few desserts: - strawberry gin and tonic - fish bowl (too drunk by now to describe the content but there was a lot of eucalyptus air, red white chocolate, dark chocolate mussel, etc) - slight overkill... - surprise egg (ok, it really looks like an egg) - buddha face with mint air... - you need to discover that ! do not touch otherwise delicious bread as you will run out of steam by second starter ! Almost 40 pages long wine list is great and well priced; being alone i got sommelier to choose --too many-- glasses of wine, mainly spanish, all being great matches with various dishes. All in, an amazing place - I still love tapas but from time to time it is worth trying something very different and original; only drawback, if i had to add one, is that between the decoration and design of dishes, everything is a bit Star Trek style, but still delicious and worth trying for roughly 140 eur.",2013-05-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or380-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26970,0.021,0.761,0.218,0.9988,0.2475400641025641,0.4987582417582417,0.3868461538461539,2431,160,0.0658165364047717,10,104,False,82,0.13,0.23,0.38,0.04,0.12,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.05,0.03,441,278,4.512471655328798,0,0,love kind place even look like restaur kind old chic build huge first floor flat transform restaur simpl decor white grey nice music background food front typic modern fusion place choos three menu differenti number dish go pre starter starter fish meat dessert usual inquiri allergi goe festiv small tast portion delici interest ok sometim interest delici case worth tri menu chang everi season time might differ mayonnais mouss eaten look like paper card turn made potato interest delici small bread garlic butter foie gra truffl game mouss eucalyptu wind amaz camembert babybel truffl caviar turnip flake cauliflow cream mizo soup white fish sashimi tasti good pre starter actual starter delici veget soup serv plastic bag never chang dish egg thin slice toast bread serv pancetta smoke salmon throat sic coconut air sic follow two main halibut belli citru air actual air realli tasti lamb pistachio amaz melt dessert strawberri gin tonic fish bowl drunk describ content lot eucalyptu air red white chocol dark chocol mussel etc slight overkil surpris egg ok realli look like egg buddha face mint air need discov touch otherwis delici bread run steam second starter almost page long wine list great well price alon got sommeli choos mani glass wine mainli spanish great match variou dish amaz place still love tapa time time worth tri someth differ origin drawback add one decor design dish everyth bit star trek style still delici worth tri roughli eur,good review,4

(If you are interested the others were Terraza del Casino for the second time, Diverxo for the fourth time and Punto MX for the first time). It was our second visit to Club Allard, but our first visit with the current chef. Of the four restaurants that we visited this was the one that blew me away the most. We had the longest tasting menu available and did wine pairing too. Our first impression, after the elegant and neat decor, was the professionalism of our sommelier and spectacular knowledge of our waiter. We had told the sommelier that we don't like run-of-the-mill wines and that we don't want to taste anything that we can drink at home in Mallorca. He embraced the project and took on the challenge, taking us through a wonderful journey of little-known wines all with a great story. Not that we loved them all, but the sommelier really appreciated our comments and occasionally brought us two wines so we could give our opinion of what went best with the dish. He really pulled out the stops.  The sommelier also gave me a list of the wines we had so if you want to know more, please ask. Our waiter too, was a credit to the restaurant. When we go to restaurants for fine dining, especially with modern cuisine, we like to ask about the preparation and elaboration of dishes. Our waiter was able to answer everything unfazed and also give us information about ingredients, for example something that came from a small village in the north of Cuba... The tasting menu was classic in its presentation and modern in the style of cuisine. The dishes were clearly thought out and the whole thing was consistent and well balanced.  My favourite dish was the ""cup cake de huevo y trufa"". When you go, please do ask for this dish to be included, it was very surprising and was excellent. At the end of the meal we met Maria Marte, the now head chef, and she was an absolute delight to talk to. She oozed passion and she had her ideas very clear. When asked which dish of the menu represents most her style of cuisine and why, she was able to answer without hesitation. Her answer (which I have posted on my blog: InMyShoesTravel) absolutely blew me away. She 100% deserves her two Michelin stars, having started out at this restaurant as a pot washer. I also have a copy of the menu which we had. If you have any questions, please ask.",2015-02-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or200-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_19469,0.02,0.817,0.164,0.9975,0.3453508771929823,0.4835087719298246,0.4036833333333333,2476,228,0.0920840064620355,0,59,False,83,0.1698113207547169,0.1132075471698113,0.3962264150943396,0.0566037735849056,0.0754716981132075,0.0188679245283018,0.0188679245283018,0.0566037735849056,0.0754716981132075,0.0188679245283018,451,249,4.487804878048781,0,0,club allard one four michelin star restaur partner visit mani day visit madrid interest other terraza del casino second time diverxo fourth time punto mx first time second visit club allard first visit current chef four restaur visit one blew away longest tast menu avail wine pair first impress eleg neat decor profession sommeli spectacular knowledg waiter told sommeli like run mill wine want tast anyth drink home mallorca embrac project took challeng take us wonder journey littl known wine great stori love sommeli realli appreci comment occasion brought us two wine could give opinion went best dish realli pull stop sommeli also gave list wine want know pleas ask waiter credit restaur go restaur fine dine especi modern cuisin like ask prepar elabor dish waiter abl answer everyth unfaz also give us inform ingredi exampl someth came small villag north cuba tast menu classic present modern style cuisin dish clearli thought whole thing consist well balanc favourit dish cup cake de huevo trufa go pleas ask dish includ surpris excel end meal met maria mart head chef absolut delight talk ooz passion idea clear ask dish menu repres style cuisin abl answer without hesit answer post blog inmyshoestravel absolut blew away deserv two michelin star start restaur pot washer also copi menu question pleas ask,good review,4

The wine list was also good and reasonably priced. However, we were disappointed with the food overall.  We have been lucky to visit many 2 and 3 Michelin starred restaurants all over the world and overall we were surprised that this restaurant has any Michelin stars as it falls very short of its peers: Every 1 out of 3 courses was excellent. However the remaining courses all tasted pretty much the same - overly fishy and salty. There were far too many fishy salty soups and broths for our liking.  The deer course was great and the desserts were good, but that's about it. We were very disappointed that my Husband was served a cheese dish for one of the main courses, despite explaining that he had an allergy to cheese. Instead of making him a different main course, they instead skipped a main dish. Given that we were paying for the largest tasting menu, it was a disgrace that they didn't bring him another dish. Also one of our dishes was absolutely inedible - a fishy bean dish - which we couldn't eat, and they didn't even bother to change it for something else! (We did notice however that they did offer a Spanish table a change of dish when they couldn't eat one of their fishy salty dishes!). So overall, we would not be going back and left somewhat disappointed. We left the lunch hungry, almost 400 euros lighter and ended up eating a full 3 course dinner 4 hours later at El Paraguas!!!

Then I started to read some of the reviews posted by people who live in my same geographical area and I got nervous that we were going to spend a lot of money and have an awful time. Well, having dined at El Club Allard, I urge everyone to ignore those naysayers and embark on the best culinary experience of your life. Yes, you eat the menu as the first course, but it goes up and up from there. The service is impeccable, our server longed for us to enjoy the food. It was quite amusing watching him try to encourage some other diners who were obviously not foodies push the food around their plates. Why go to a restaurant like this for a true dining experience if you don't appreciate the cuisine. The only way to describe some of the dishes is ""trompe l'oiel"", which is to say that it looks like one thing and tastes like another. The presentation is gorgeous and so clever and the tastes are out of this world. My favorite was the ""onion soup: which was presented as ice cream with caramel sauce but was in fact the most delicious onion soup with cheese.The sommelier was top notch and so personable. The chef de cusine presented herself at the end of the serving and I managed to get a tour of the kitchen which was gorgeous. My advice is that you get out of it what you put in, if you go in with the right attitude, you will absolutely love everything. Others apparently are prepped to criticize so nothing will seem right.

The food definitely deserves more than the 3 point rating I am giving overall, but for the experience I had and considering I have been too forgiving in the overall ratings before, I have to be more rigorous on this one. It was the classical ""restaurant with great food and reputation, but you somehow felt awkwardly misplaced"" kind of journey. Now I do not know if our table's main waiter had a bad day or if the fact that we might have been generally younger than the usual guests was what made it so extremely awkward, but one should leave a restaurant feeling happy due to other reasons than being able to flee the uneasiness - starting from the welcoming part to when you finally set foot outside of it again. But let's talk about the food. Starting with choosing the menu and having to eat the little sheet of ""paper"" right after was a great and funny twist to the experience, yet it did lack of taste. The edible paper (so to say) was not much more than what you were used to as a kid. Fun but tasteless and the kind of mayonnaise served with it didn't help.  That being said it goes uphill from now on. The grilled sea selection with essential oils that followed later during the menu was a delicious composition. Amazing presentation, well thought through and the interactive part with the oil just gave it the extra kick to make this dish one to remember.  There isn't much to say about every single dish, given I had struggled with this review and it is some time ago now too. Yet on the other hand the food was an average good to very good and so what I will still be mentioning are simply the highlights that cannot be left unsaid.  Hence the cold cherry soup with herring caviar. What a dream! I have yet to try this myself. Imagine yourself on a hot and dry day in Spain, sitting outside a finca, resting in the shadow of a big old tree and refreshing yourself with cold and cherry-flavored spoons full of tranquility. It was a pairing of tastes I have not yet had the chance to enjoy before, an idea that is quite simple actually, but so splendid and surprising that it is yet another one of those dishes at el club Allard that will stick to one's mind.  As of the desserts, they were outstanding by themselves. In particular the hibiscus flower with Pisco Sour. This little creation has simply been a masterpiece! Taking on the much earlier eaten freshness of the cherry soup (as if as an homage) and yet still keeping the sweetness needed in a dessert. Crunchy, sour, fizzy, creamy - combining it all to a very exquisite piece of art. Talking about an exquisite piece of art one cannot leave out the fishbowl. Now that is a memory. It is amazing to see what can be done with sugar and sweets and chocolate. This is, on the creative side, a bravo to the cuisine! Although as of taste it could not quite hold up with the hibiscus flower.  To not go on and on about every detail of each dessert or dish in general, this restaurant does not lack of creativity in its food. Not in the flavors, not the presentation, not the way you might sometimes have to eat it. It is a modern and delightful experience in that concern. The ambience as well is rather modern and promising. Yet what it definitely lacks and causes me to be harsh in my overall rating is the heart. The warmth. The Spanish sun that when coming inside makes you want to stay and come again. I will be happy to return but remain sincerely hopeful to experience a more cheerful staff and leave with a smile, rather than a sigh of relief.",2015-01-18,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or200-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_26984,0.043,0.745,0.212,0.9994,0.179609868043603,0.5018244406196215,0.4376857142857143,3660,357,0.0975409836065573,3,74,False,95,0.1057692307692307,0.1586538461538461,0.2884615384615384,0.0817307692307692,0.125,0.0336538461538461,0.0288461538461538,0.0336538461538461,0.0961538461538461,0.048076923076923,682,353,4.360703812316715,0,0,given prais restaur receiv continu receiv hard time come want say review food definit deserv point rate give overal experi consid forgiv overal rate rigor one classic restaur great food reput somehow felt awkwardli misplac kind journey know tabl main waiter bad day fact might gener younger usual guest made extrem awkward one leav restaur feel happi due reason abl flee uneasi start welcom part final set foot outsid let talk food start choos menu eat littl sheet paper right great funni twist experi yet lack tast edibl paper say much use kid fun tasteless kind mayonnais serv help said goe uphil grill sea select essenti oil follow later menu delici composit amaz present well thought interact part oil gave extra kick make dish one rememb much say everi singl dish given struggl review time ago yet hand food averag good good still mention simpli highlight cannot left unsaid henc cold cherri soup her caviar dream yet tri imagin hot dri day spain sit outsid finca rest shadow big old tree refresh cold cherri flavor spoon full tranquil pair tast yet chanc enjoy idea quit simpl actual splendid surpris yet anoth one dish el club allard stick one mind dessert outstand particular hibiscu flower pisco sour littl creation simpli masterpiec take much earlier eaten fresh cherri soup homag yet still keep sweet need dessert crunchi sour fizzi creami combin exquisit piec art talk exquisit piec art one cannot leav fishbowl memori amaz see done sugar sweet chocol creativ side bravo cuisin although tast could quit hold hibiscu flower go everi detail dessert dish gener restaur lack creativ food flavor present way might sometim eat modern delight experi concern ambienc well rather modern promis yet definit lack caus harsh overal rate heart warmth spanish sun come insid make want stay come happi return remain sincer hope experi cheer staff leav smile rather sigh relief,good review,4

We went for broke with the Revolucion menu and wine paring and did not regret a euro of it. The wait staff were very attentive and courteous throughout the evening and did a good job in describing each of the 14 dishes on the menu. And, we were given a copy of the menu at the end as a keepsake.  Each dish was beautifully presented, with visual and scent enhancements which added to the pleasure of the dish. We were amazed at the inventiveness of the dishes and there was not one item on the menu which was not delicious. The wine pairings nicely complimented all of the dishes also. The price was exceptional considering the quality of the cuisine.

I wonder if it's because of the Spanish committee is too picky and demanding?! Anyway, we chose the 13 course menu and ordered the sommelier to match the wine for us (47€ per head). We were very much satisfied and feeling just right after the lunch. The lunch starts with a surprise, the menu card can be eaten with the aperitif. We after the waiter to not explain us the plate but just when we finished and guessed the ingredients and the way of preparation. Hey, after all I was 70% right. It was lots of fun even for the waiters! If you have a sensible taste, please do so! We loved all the courses, the potential ones were ""chupito de pez mantequilla y espárrago blanco"", ""sardina ahumada con crema de apio-nabo y manzana"", ""arroz del mar"", and ""rodaballo al horno con ahumado de arbequin"".  I need to mention the sommelier and send him congratulations. I told him that I love red wine and he changed the white wine to a lighter A.O.C Bourgogne (Confuron-Cotetidot Pinot Noir 2011) to match the monk fish. It emphasized the fish texture and the smokey taste and in the meantime the wine being smooth and potential. It was a wonderful match and the after flavor was chocolate with cherry in your mouth.  Probably the dessert is not the strength of the chef that I would say. There was one plate that I felt it didn't make sense. When we finished the lunch, they gave us the list of the wine and the courses that we ate. It was a very nice detail, and I was trying to eat them again, lol. We very much enjoyed the meal!

Dinner starts with a so-called “menu” that is in fact a price list where you can only choose one of three menus, the difference being how many items you will be served and the price, the more items to be served the costlier your meal will be, of course. Choices are, I believe, 89€ for 11 items or “steps”, as they call them, 98€ for 13 “steps”, or 128€ for 15 “steps”. And that's all you can choose.  When I asked my waiter what the “steps” consisted of, or what options were available within the “steps” to be served, he declined to tell me, saying only that would be the chef's “surprise”. The so-called “menu” is edible, and tasteless, but it is accompanied by a very tasty sauce in which the waiter invites you to dip the “menu”, which makes it a very good amuse bouche. Many “steps” that I was served were excellent, but some I did not like. The failure to allow one to choose what one would prefer to be served can of course lead to the chef sending the wrong “surprise” to your table. For example, at a neighboring table a lady who did not eat chicken at all was served a chicken “step”, while at the same time I was served an equivalent pigeon “step”. If we had been able to choose I would have indicated that I preferred the chicken that was served to the lady who did not eat chicken; and certainly the lady in the neighboring table would have said that she did not eat chicken before the chicken was served to her.  In general the “steps” I was served leaned towards seafood too much for my taste; I would have preferred more meat and less seafood, but I was never asked or even allowed to tell because the chef wanted to “surprise” me. The prior time that I visited el Club Allard the final “step” of the meal one could swear was a hard boiled egg, but in fact it was a frozen dessert. That dessert was one of the highlights of the meal and I understood it to be a trademark of this restaurant. Well, no egg this time, and I really missed it. Service was good but not outstanding. Spanish is my native language, but often I was not able to understand what my waiter was saying because instead of speaking clearly he spoke too fast and mumbling. And instead of placing cutlery on the table, the waiter always seemed to drop it, sometimes from a distance; weird I think. Otherwise service was fine. My first dinner at el Club Allard was one year before my most recent visit in December 2014. My recollection is that my original dinner at el Club Allard was far more enjoyable, a truly memorable experience; maybe the chef guessed better what I preferred to eat, or perhaps it was another chef. Be that as it may, I now feel that I will not return to el Club Allard because this time my meal was not spectacular, as I recall was my prior meal at this restaurant. And anyway instead of having the chef “surprise” me, I prefer to have a say in what I want to eat.",2014-12-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or210-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27017,0.045,0.871,0.084,0.9786,0.0791523809523809,0.6105285714285714,0.4577619047619048,3028,298,0.0984147952443857,0,61,False,103,0.0804597701149425,0.1149425287356321,0.2988505747126437,0.0919540229885057,0.1264367816091954,0.0,0.0344827586206896,0.1379310344827586,0.0919540229885057,0.0229885057471264,573,267,4.282722513089006,0,0,el club allard fine restaur problem must eat whatev chef select necessarili would prefer dinner start call menu fact price list choos one three menu differ mani item serv price item serv costlier meal cours choic believ item step call step step choos ask waiter step consist option avail within step serv declin tell say would chef surpris call menu edibl tasteless accompani tasti sauc waiter invit dip menu make good amus bouch mani step serv excel like failur allow one choos one would prefer serv cours lead chef send wrong surpris tabl exampl neighbor tabl ladi eat chicken serv chicken step time serv equival pigeon step abl choos would indic prefer chicken serv ladi eat chicken certainli ladi neighbor tabl would said eat chicken chicken serv gener step serv lean toward seafood much tast would prefer meat less seafood never ask even allow tell chef want surpris prior time visit el club allard final step meal one could swear hard boil egg fact frozen dessert dessert one highlight meal understood trademark restaur well egg time realli miss servic good outstand spanish nativ languag often abl understand waiter say instead speak clearli spoke fast mumbl instead place cutleri tabl waiter alway seem drop sometim distanc weird think otherwis servic fine first dinner el club allard one year recent visit decemb recollect origin dinner el club allard far enjoy truli memor experi mayb chef guess better prefer eat perhap anoth chef may feel return el club allard time meal spectacular recal prior meal restaur anyway instead chef surpris prefer say want eat,bad review,2

To put this review in context, we were six people who were in Madrid four days re-visiting and trying new restaurants. We ate at Casa Lucio, (twice lunch and a late dinner), El Paraguas, La Trainera and O'Pazo which were all stellar. We also ate at Ten Con Ten which was okay but highly overrated.  I have never written a bad review as I would not want to hurt the people who make their living by working in a service industry. Having said that, I can not hold back my absolute contempt for the food, the service and the ambience of El Club Allard. This was on my list of fine restaurants in Madrid; it should never have been on my list or any other list when it comes to gourmet dining. The gimmicks of eating a tasteless paper, akin to receiving a communion wafer, was just the start. The cold razor clams were dirty with grit. The silly foam additions on every other plate were totally lacking of flavor, truly a new low in Spanish cuisine. The turbot was like rubber. We had the Superior menu which only meant we had more insipid dishes than any one person should ever try to eat.  What was truly appalling was the service! We had a waiter who thought it was funny to plop down our silverware after each course. He seemed to have some personal, internal joke going on that made him speak about each dish as rapidly and incomprehensible as he could. He was rude and insulting. I had wanted to walk out after the first ten minutes but did not want to embarrass the rest of the members in my party. This was a mistake because two of our guests were sick with food poisoning for 24 hours, ruining two days of our holiday. To finish up, the ambience of the room that we sat in was cold and dark; a gray room made especially for visiting tourists. I apologize to the reviewers who had a good meal here but I truly recommend you try the restaurants that I mentioned in the beginning of this review, so as to know where the great food, excellent service and warm ambience can be enjoyed while in Madrid.",2014-12-02,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or210-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_22413,0.093,0.753,0.154,0.9816,0.0044663411523876,0.5589951005067285,0.569321052631579,2145,211,0.0983682983682983,1,40,False,68,0.053763440860215,0.0967741935483871,0.1935483870967742,0.021505376344086,0.1182795698924731,0.043010752688172,0.0967741935483871,0.064516129032258,0.2043010752688172,0.1075268817204301,405,233,4.293827160493827,0,0,want qualifi review tell reader one six restaur ate last week novemb put review context six peopl madrid four day visit tri new restaur ate casa lucio twice lunch late dinner el paragua la trainera pazo stellar also ate ten con ten okay highli overr never written bad review would want hurt peopl make live work servic industri said hold back absolut contempt food servic ambienc el club allard list fine restaur madrid never list list come gourmet dine gimmick eat tasteless paper akin receiv communion wafer start cold razor clam dirti grit silli foam addit everi plate total lack flavor truli new low spanish cuisin turbot like rubber superior menu meant insipid dish one person ever tri eat truli appal servic waiter thought funni plop silverwar cours seem person intern joke go made speak dish rapidli incomprehens could rude insult want walk first ten minut want embarrass rest member parti mistak two guest sick food poison hour ruin two day holiday finish ambienc room sat cold dark gray room made especi visit tourist apolog review good meal truli recommend tri restaur mention begin review know great food excel servic warm ambienc enjoy madrid,bad review,2

Upon entering this opulent venue we were greeted with excellent service and taken to our table.

When the bell rang for our food (twice) and after the friendly bartender summoned Alex, he continued to smoke I his cigarette and chat outside. This left the bartender to fetch our food- THANKS TO HIM! 2. It was 18:00 and I guess quitting time for Alex. He was very courteous in telling us ""goodbye and not to hurry"" however we asked for the bill and he brought it and I sat the card down, but he left (guess he was on a tight schedule). This let the next server to complete our credit card transaction. Oh, we gave a couple extra euro to Alex before he left, which is also why I was disappointed he didn't run the card.

I can’t say one thing that was extraordinary. Can’t fault the workers, service was good. Another bad in my opinion, they should have more than 3 red wines by the glass.

A brief hiccup on arrival - we wanted to go for a drink at the open air rooftop bar, but were told it was full to capacity; on taking the lift up there anyway, there was plenty of space! But we left quickly as it didn't offer the views we'd hoped for.  After that, it was amazing! Descending one floor to the restaurant, we found that it was possible to sit outside on their cosy, secluded terrace area - a bonus as we'd hoped to do this but hadn't thought it possible. It offered an interesting perspective of the immediate vicinity below (though isn’t really high enough to provide a wide ranging view of a wider area of the city).  We opted for the €70 seven-course tasting menu (without wine flight). The head waitress and all the staff were excellent at explaining to us (in faultless English) not only what we were about to eat, but on occasions how to eat it...! The standard was very high across all the courses, and service was attentive without overly disturbing us, despite being outside and away from the restaurant's main footfall area. I would recommend Atico restaurant if you're looking for a high-end 'occasion' meal in Madrid.

We decided not to go for the pairing wines, but instead ordered a bottle of rosé, the waiter was extremely helpful with the wine list as we were unsure which rosé to go for. The wine was perfect and it only cost €22 for a bottle! I really enjoyed the puffed bread that came with the first course, it was so tasty and unusual!

I booked over a month ago and when we get to the place, which was empty apart from a table of two, they say I booked at bar. Now that’s impossible I told them and they insisted that I did. I was going to turn around a leave, as one can imagine bar stools are not conducive for a long lunch for the back. Anyway we stayed. The food was actually excellent, the guacamole and chips great, all the tacos we had were great and we had a sous vide beef dish that was excellent. Good selection of beers and the bartender can whip up various cocktails. We had an interesting Mexican bloody marry which was not bad at all.  The waitress was very friendly.

Boy oh boy, what a mistake. We ended up with just average food, sloppy service and rather irritating wine pairings: at about half of the 6 course dinner the waiter simply told us the last wine would be repeated and proceeded to pour us the same white wine again. Given the positioning and pricing of this menu I found that incredibly offensive. We complained and they ended up giving us the coffee and water for free - again with an incredibly irritating waiter telling us „all is covered” and not accepting a tip. I thought this was almost offensive. The menu felt very rushed as we were forcefed through 6 courses in 1.5 hrs.

Friendly staff and great cocktails! However, when I order ‘interesting, new things’ I’m usually hoping for a bit of ‘umph’ in the flavours, especially with mexican food, and that was lacking a little here. The specialty dishes boasted an array of unorthodox ingredients, but they were still a bit ‘anonymous’ in terms of the flavours. Everything kind of just tasted like, well, good mexican food, but nothing really stood out in its flavour-profile, which is what I was hoping for, personally.  One disclaimer though — we had some very flavourful cocktails before the meal, which Did have a bit of ‘umph’ to them, so that might have taken everything after it down a notch.

We chose Atico from reviews and thought we'd have a nice view etc. On showing up, we were early so we were asked if we wanted a cocktail while waiting. We sat and enjoyed a very nice drink. After 15 mins, we were led to our table. We were placed right by a wall so already we thought why so many talk about a fantastic view. Maybe its not during dinner. More lunch but I don't know so that was a slight let down. We chose our starter and mains and I noticed our cocktails that we left behind (part of the service) was taken to the wrong table. I waved to say they were ours. Chose the wine was was lovely. We did notice that staff were rushing around a bit. As if there was a hurry to serve. I've been to many fine dining restaurants and I believe in a slower pace. Enjoy your food and drink without feeling rushed.  Starter came out and we were given the wrong plates. Not a problem but still another slight error. We ate our starters which were lovely. I had octopus and my girlfriend, duck. Both very nice. Once we finished, the main was out within 5 mins. Rather quick for us. During this time I asked for more bread. It never came. I also asked for more olive oil. I had to ask twice. Not what I come to expect when you're paying a lot of money. Mains came out. Both lovely. I had the lamb shank and the missus, pork. Once finished, the table was cleared. We waited for the desert menu. We waited and waited. People around us who came after us were on their deserts so Ihad to ask after 15 mins for a desert menu. By this time we weren't happy. If the service was slower and you could slowly enjoy the occasion, I would of bought another bottle of wine but we just wanted to leave. We were even undercharged. We're honest people so pointed out we were charged for two glasses of wine rather than a bottle. I'm sure other people have had a amazing time here but for us, we wouldn't go back.

The attention from the time you walk in was comforting.  It is quaint and you can choose to dine inside or out on the terrace.  I had the steak tartare which was nice,y prepared with a great sauce as a compliment. It was dressed with varying types of potato chips on top. Interesting.  My favorite thing of the night however was the flan. The outpouring of flavors literally melted in my mouth. Never tasted flan sooo good. The nuts, the caramel infused with the other spices. Not overwhelming.....Just darn good.  I also tried the rooftop ....La Terraza and the drinks and ambiance were great.i outed for the margarita which was nicely done.

I went with my wife for lunch and started with an amuse bouche, followed by Spanish ham croquettes, potato ravioli filled with manet prawns in a piquant sauce. My wife had for main course pressed chicken with eel accompanied by apple, and I had steak tartare with crisps. We had one dessert to share which was chocolate with salt and olive oil. The bread served with the meal was very good-fresh and tasty. We both had a glass of wine from a list of around 6 choices covering white, rose, and red, in addition to mineral water and one coffee. The bill was €76 so represented fairly good value for money; and the view from the Terrace pleasant and interesting, and the ambience cosy. Verdict on the food: my wife didn't like the croquettes-there are better examples in some other restaurants in Madrid-nor her main course. My main course was reasonably good and properly seasoned, although hot french fries rather than a kind of crisp would have been preferred. The chocolate dessert was good but not exceptional. Service was professional. Overall our experience was slightly disappointing, but if our expectations had not been so high we would have probably rated it 4 instead of 3-",2017-02-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7779187-Reviews-or50-Atico_Restaurant-Madrid.html,UID_27138,0.024,0.886,0.09,0.8367,0.2029310344827586,0.4792528735632183,0.2960818181818181,1247,96,0.0769847634322373,0,27,False,47,0.1428571428571428,0.1714285714285714,0.3142857142857143,0.0714285714285714,0.2,0.0285714285714285,0.0,0.0285714285714285,0.0285714285714285,0.0142857142857142,214,146,4.831775700934579,0,0,ramon freixa overse restaur expect better went wife lunch start amus bouch follow spanish ham croquett potato ravioli fill manet prawn piquant sauc wife main cours press chicken eel accompani appl steak tartar crisp one dessert share chocol salt oliv oil bread serv meal good fresh tasti glass wine list around choic cover white rose red addit miner water one coffe bill repres fairli good valu money view terrac pleasant interest ambienc cosi verdict food wife like croquett better exampl restaur madrid main cours main cours reason good properli season although hot french fri rather kind crisp would prefer chocol dessert good except servic profession overal experi slightli disappoint expect high would probabl rate instead,average review,3

It is definitely off the beaten path and honestly I felt like we were lost while trying to find it. Thank goodness for phone GPS because we might not have found it otherwise. This is in no way a complaint more of an observation.  We had a great meal and it felt a little strange coming all the way to Madrid only to eat Mexican food but we are sure glad we did. We absolutely love Mexican food back home so off we went looking for this place. We made reservations online and upon arrival we found a table set up for us with our name on it already which was a very nice touch that we haven't seen before.  The workers were all very friendly and helpful. We started out with the nachos which were amazing! Both of our entrees were very good as were the margaritas. We also finished with a mousse dessert which was great. My only complaint was around towards the end of the meal the service slowed considerably. This might be the busy go fast American style of eating vs the more relaxed slow pace meals the locals are used to. It did take a little while to get our check but it wasn’t the end of the world.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great Mexican meal,2018-12-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12928989-Reviews-or20-La_Chamana-Madrid.html,UID_27151,0.036,0.736,0.227,0.9963,0.2471774193548387,0.5260931899641577,0.527892857142857,1261,126,0.0999206978588422,1,15,False,53,0.14,0.22,0.26,0.06,0.2,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.02,243,149,4.181069958847736,0,0,wife went one night stay madrid honeymoon definit beaten path honestli felt like lost tri find thank good phone gp might found otherwis way complaint observ great meal felt littl strang come way madrid eat mexican food sure glad absolut love mexican food back home went look place made reserv onlin upon arriv found tabl set us name alreadi nice touch seen worker friendli help start nacho amaz entre good margarita also finish mouss dessert great complaint around toward end meal servic slow consider might busi go fast american style eat vs relax slow pace meal local use take littl get check end world highli recommend place anyon look great mexican meal,very good review,5

We selected fro the a la carte menu and the prearranged discount that we were promised by booking through ""Fork"" was honored. It was nice to get 20% taken off the top of everything we ordered. Lovely view and very professional service. Great for a date or a special night out. The only issue we encountered was that the elevator that services the restaurant is very small and cannot accommodate more than 2 people at a time.

The restaurant is informal and relaxed and the wait staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. I'm usually disappointed with UK efforts at Mexican style food, but not here. The food is a million miles away from standard tex mex fare. Chicken Tostadas were excellent - well spiced chicken with very fresh herbs and vegetable toppings. Also superb value for money. A Chicken Manchamantel main was equally tasty with a blend between mildly spiced sauce and grilled fresh fruits - A very different and enjoyable dish. There is a good selection of draft and bottled beer. We had a very good bottle of white wine that was also very reasonably priced.

We had the sense to find the place the day before when we were in the area which I would suggest, as it is not too easy to find. We were greeted and seated in a beautiful old, high ceilinged dining room. The service was good, our waiter's English was not perfect which made understanding what each course a little tricky. But then it is a Spanish restaurant and I would like to see most waiters in Britain explaining intricate courses in Spanish!! It is artistic, impressive, beautiful and with many taste experiences. We had the largest menu (probably because we didn't want to miss out on anything/we are greedy!) and it was possibly too much. Not because of the quantity (which was perfectly adequate for 16 courses!) but for the richness of it all. I wish I had pushed for the sommelier to suggest a different wine with each few courses, as people seem to have done on this, but nervousness and lack of direct communication from me prevented this. The sommelier was excellent though and we ended up with a beautiful wine, that did not break the bank. In fact the whole meal for 2 of us came in at about £230 including wine which I think was incredibly good value.",2014-10-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or230-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27202,0.054,0.724,0.222,0.9941,0.3033866442199776,0.5562514029180696,0.6731846153846154,1236,121,0.0978964401294498,4,30,False,48,0.0769230769230769,0.1794871794871795,0.3076923076923077,0.0769230769230769,0.2564102564102564,0.0,0.0256410256410256,0.0256410256410256,0.0512820512820512,0.0,225,148,4.497777777777777,0,0,previou posit review valid experi sens find place day area would suggest easi find greet seat beauti old high ceiling dine room servic good waiter english perfect made understand cours littl tricki spanish restaur would like see waiter britain explain intric cours spanish artist impress beauti mani tast experi largest menu probabl want miss anyth greedi possibl much quantiti perfectli adequ cours rich wish push sommeli suggest differ wine cours peopl seem done nervous lack direct commun prevent sommeli excel though end beauti wine break bank fact whole meal us came includ wine think incred good valu,good review,4

When said opportunity appeared, I grabbed it by the lapels. Bottom line: totally worth it! A luxury meal generates expectations, forged through other meals and our forward-looking fantasies and desires. When I walk into a luxury restaurant, I want to be surprised and pleased, in a balance of comfort and familiarity with surprise and why not, thrill. El Club Allard (ECA) delivers all that in large amounts. Chef María Marta del Rosario displays flair and respect for the ingredient, with the right sprinkling of irony and trompe l'oeil. My friend and I went for the complete menu, all 14 dishes from snacks to petit fours. It took a good three hours in which we were really taken by the food, with the environment to match, and a solid service, although occasionally peppered with slightly flippant attitudes. What a wonderful parade! Maria Marte's universe is a playground of textures, colors and flavors that amuse, excite and fascinate. Some memorable dishes were a pigeon and foie gras truffle in a cloud of eucaliptus smoke, an egg with potato and bacon bonbon, a sardine in turnip puree, a concentrated butterfish broth ""shot"" with salmon roe toast and a dessert of chocolate ""rocks"". A fantastic dinner, one of the best I had in 30 years of eating in 40 countries spread over four continents. Find YOUR reason to go to EAC, and go.

We walked past the grand, imposing doors of the restaurant without even knowing it. But once we realised, we were shown into a lovely corridor which looked like we were guests in an exclusive villa. The waiter who served us had a slight arrogance about him but seemed to gradually warm up and was even humorous at times. Ambience of the restaurant was elegant but relaxed with plenty of natural light. Now the food itself was just splendid, my favourite is still the seafood platter (steaming fresh prawn, razor clams, clams grilled to perfection) with a twist served on a mini stone bbq with 3 different types of oils in syringes. But the dish with the most wow-factor has to be the first course being none other than the menu itself - the words intricately printed with squid ink and completely edible, of course only after you have decided on your courses. Other highlights included the lobster (again perfectly cooked), icy foie gras shavings which melted in your mouth, caviar infused cherry and desserts, although I thought the fish bowl which looked a little sloppy and I wasn't a big fan of the yoghurt base (although I loved the red 'fronds'). Nothing better than to finish up with 'chocolate rocks' and a passionfruit flavoured chalk. Overall I found the flavours complemented each other especially the creative appetizers. The 4 of us spent about 580 euro including a bottle of wine which is reasonable value for this calibre of dining so it was well worth the experience.",2014-10-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or230-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27204,0.033,0.762,0.204,0.9957,0.1753571428571428,0.548809523809524,0.5323,1554,125,0.0804375804375804,0,33,False,50,0.0697674418604651,0.1627906976744186,0.3255813953488372,0.0930232558139534,0.1162790697674418,0.0465116279069767,0.0232558139534883,0.0232558139534883,0.1162790697674418,0.0232558139534883,271,190,4.7380073800738005,0,0,first thing need find entranc el club allard walk past grand impos door restaur without even know realis shown love corridor look like guest exclus villa waiter serv us slight arrog seem gradual warm even humor time ambienc restaur eleg relax plenti natur light food splendid favourit still seafood platter steam fresh prawn razor clam clam grill perfect twist serv mini stone bbq differ type oil syring dish wow factor first cours none menu word intric print squid ink complet edibl cours decid cours highlight includ lobster perfectli cook ici foie gra shave melt mouth caviar infus cherri dessert although thought fish bowl look littl sloppi big fan yoghurt base although love red frond noth better finish chocol rock passionfruit flavour chalk overal found flavour complement especi creativ appet us spent euro includ bottl wine reason valu calibr dine well worth experi,good review,4

The disappointment was from the first moment, they let me wait a long time, until someone approached me, asking my name for the reservation. We ordered a “ Degustación menu “ with a matching wine list, the food was mediocre and down, just not tasty, a difference of day and night from the wonderful meal I experienced at the Unico Restaurant, the service was very clumsy. In addition to that , I asked for something to mark the 50th birthday of my dear friend, It is true I called only 6 hours before we arrived to the restaurant, what we got was : at the end of the meal we were served another glass of sweet wine for dessert for the birthday, it was simply insulting !! Even a small fire refining could have done the job. For a chef's meal with a cost of nearly 200 euros, the disappointment was very big !!

It's an unassuming restaurant from the exterior but that doesn't matter when the food is as good as it was. We were welcomed in and sat at the window next to the door. Tables and chairs are wooden, pretty old and probably not the comfiest but that just adds to its charm in my opinion. We ordered 3 dishes and a bottle of Rioja (the fried anchovies were a particular favourite). 3 dishes might not sound a great amount when talking about tapas however these were huge in comparison to your standard UK alternative. Total cost was €24. The food was faultless, cooked fresh, delicious! The wine was enjoyable too. Overall a great find and had it not been for our short stay we would've returned without a doubt!

The Seduction menu which I had, introduced many layers of flavors and textures into each dish, and they all came together well to tease my curiosity into wonderment. Not only were my taste buds tempted beyond human restraint, visuals and smells were all impressive.  The placard at the start of the meal was made of Japanese rice paper and printed with squid ink - and when the waiter told me it could be eaten, I thought he was joking! Therein started my culinary journey and every single appetizer/course was a pleasant surprise. The chef used flavors from all over - Asia to Latin American etc - which showcased his/her top notch knowledge and hands-on experience with these ingredients. Nothing experimental but certainly the ingredients were all well matched with each other. Apart from culinary enjoyment, it was a test of my food knowledge as well! Without giving away the many delectable encounters I had here, I would divulge my experience with the desserts. Petals, was rose mousse encased in white chocolate encrusted with dried rose petals - the embodiment of subtle sweetness and lightness. All these were balanced with Granny Smith sorbet and lychee cream. The riot of colors in front me, the faint whiff of rose and light sweetness on my tongue made it thoroughly unforgettable. The different textures, the various co-mingled flavors - wow, just exceeded my expectations on how one can deal with a rose flavored dessert!

Blink and you'll miss it. My third visit, and better than ever. We arrived at 10:15 on a week night, knowing they were fully booked (that's fully booked twice over - they have a first and second sitting), but praying a table might come free. We loitered until 11, and were given the last table - having been here before I knew it would be worth waiting for. This is the place to try some of the more unusual things on the menu, confident that they will be well executed. The raw egg/fermented soya bean/chopped raw tuna dish was to DIE for - the lady serving us checked that we liked unusual flavours when I ordered it. Agree with previous reviewers that this is probably the best Japanese food you'll find in Madrid, without paying through the nose for something much more 'haute'. The service is gracious and helpful. If you want a table where you sit on the floor, ask, as they have a few - similarly, say so if you want to sit at the bar or at a regular table.

While we waited at the the bar to get seated, we got to interact with the most amazing bartender ever -- Peter Hernandez. We started out just ordering drinks at the bar, but it was so nice sitting there that we had our meal there too and forgot about getting a table! The sangria is amazing and is a must try here. We saw the bartender make at least 30 of those delicious drinks served in mason jar like glasses. Apparently they serve over a hundred sangrias every night :O The service at Taberna El Sur is spectacular -- I got a second sangria on the house, and the bartender even brought us two shots of a baileys-like drink at the end of our meal! We left feeling so special and happy :)  About the food -- the tapas and main courses are really tasty and well portioned. We got the moussaka, patatas bravas, spanish omelette and a chilled tomato soup (all the tapas but the quiche basically) and each one was a star! I am trying to pick a favorite, but I really can't pick between the moussaka and the patatas bravas, both of which were unforgettable! We also got a chicken curry that was great.  Overall, if you are in the area or even close by, Taberna El Sur is definitely worth your time and money! Go there, and I hope you have as great a time as we did eating, drinking and enjoying being in Madrid!  PS.

It is a feast for all the senses. Colours, flavours, odours, textures all combined harmoniously to deliver the perfect food which tantalises the palate to the extreme. The restaurant is housed in a rococo building that impresses architecturally even the most demanding connoisseur and is in contrast with the interior of the restaurant deemed to be minimalist in style but welcoming at the same time. There is no menu. The Chef cooks the same for every body the night you visit the restaurant, the only variation is how many dishes you want to try. Of course there is a prior consultation with the client regarding allergies and likes and dislikes. Keep in mind this is not a normal restaurant where you eat a steak and fries. This is a place where a secret teasing of your appetite and senses is taking place and the element of the surprise and the unexpected comes in the game often. What you see and eat is art in every sense. Be prepared to receive the visit of the chef at the end of your meal who wants to know the opinion of the clients at the end of the dinner. Service excellent. Not to be missed.

(As U.S. citizens we eat much earlier than the locals.) The white wine by the glass was delicious and the waitress helped me select it. She presented us with a spectacular gazpacho in a small cup and bread with an olive oil whipped cream. (I think that's what it was.) I wish we could have had more! My first course (roasted tomatoes with mackerel) was absolutely divine. I would order it again and recommend it. My second course was a rice dish with one red prawn and four pieces of ham. It wasn't remarkable. The ambiance is nice but the music needs work. We stayed in the Principal Hotel so we would have breakfast in the same area as the restaurant and enjoy the bar before dinner. The same song playlist is on loop and has been for the entire time we have been there. I believe we listened to Piano Man twice while dining at Atico.

I would describe the food as a science experiment - with foam! First course was the menu printed with squid ink on a wafer - that was just funny, but once the other courses started coming, we lost our sense of humor. There was 2 inch piece of fish that would have tasted fine except it was covered with an inch of foam made out of fish bone marrow - it had a very fishy taste. One course was cherry soup with a whole cherry stuffed with caviar instead of the cherry pit (I think the waiter said it was a herring caviar - not the good stuff). I understand that its hard to stuff a cherry with caviar, but why would you want to? it does not taste good, though the soup was not bad. The best course was the truffle in a bowl of smoke - this was a pate ball. The only meat was a pigeon, that wasn't bad either. The desert - we had 2 courses: 1 was swimming in rose flavored concoction that no one could eat - at this point even the real foodies among stopped saying this was ""interesting"", not tasty - interesting. The second looked like chocolate cake but was not at all sweet, then, with coffee, there were wafers or cookies that looked like letters and chalk served on a blackboard - clever but not sweet and not tasty.  The whole experience was pretentious, from a waiter who pretended to smile by showing teeth, to the multiple tiny courses that were artistic and pretended to be food, but did not taste like anything special. Even the foodies among our 3 couples felt this was an ""interesting"" experience, the rest of us just thought it was funny and sad by turns. For 400+ dollars per couple, you can definitely have a much better dining experience in Madrid.",2014-09-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or240-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27254,0.104,0.752,0.144,0.9545,0.1951415701415701,0.5896718146718148,0.3111846153846154,1783,154,0.0863712843522153,1,48,False,64,0.086021505376344,0.1397849462365591,0.3333333333333333,0.064516129032258,0.1182795698924731,0.043010752688172,0.043010752688172,0.032258064516129,0.086021505376344,0.053763440860215,335,193,4.322388059701493,0,0,disappoint food present beauti clever time tast noth special would describ food scienc experi foam first cours menu print squid ink wafer funni cours start come lost sens humor inch piec fish would tast fine except cover inch foam made fish bone marrow fishi tast one cours cherri soup whole cherri stuf caviar instead cherri pit think waiter said her caviar good stuff understand hard stuff cherri caviar would want tast good though soup bad best cours truffl bowl smoke pate ball meat pigeon bad either desert cours swim rose flavor concoct one could eat point even real foodi among stop say interest tasti interest second look like chocol cake sweet coffe wafer cooki look like letter chalk serv blackboard clever sweet tasti whole experi pretenti waiter pretend smile show teeth multipl tini cours artist pretend food tast like anyth special even foodi among coupl felt interest experi rest us thought funni sad turn dollar per coupl definit much better dine experi madrid,very bad review,1

Everybody, at certain point, could easily differentiate a nice place and/or an enjoyable meal from an ugly location, a terrible service or a tasteless food. However, from “nice” to “excellent”, there is a slight and always subjective line difficult to define.  Club Allard has a very good service (considering the Spanish standards). Its wine list is comprehensive and covers from the middle to the high-end wines of Europe and some “new-world” vineyards. Nevertheless, the food is a different topic. The restaurant only serves testing menus and they are renewed each season. It is not traditional place (you will not find the typical Spanish dishes or the “tapas” ambiance) and, certainly, I would not suggest bringing kinds. For those who want just a fancy dinner, Club Allard may be “excessive”.

We already stopped by in the afternoon as we wanted to have a coffee in their roof terrace but we were informed it was without service and closed in low season. So we returned for dinner. The Atico restaurant is small so I highly recommend reservation which we didn´t have done but we were seated.  The place is very comfortable and the staff is amazing....very helpful and tentative. As a main course I got Tuna top loin with citrus fruits and blintzes and my friend Crunchy socarrat rice with duck and Norway lobster. I do not like ducks but my friends meal was so delicious that my fork was constantly in his plate. But my tuna (tataki) was delicious as well.  Then we got coffee on their lovely roof terrace...however it was without service they allowed us to enter for coffee. And finished dinner with couple of drinks in their bar. We enjoyed this our last Madrid dinner very much and if returned to Madrid we would definitely come back.,2015-11-16,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7779187-Reviews-or80-Atico_Restaurant-Madrid.html,UID_27272,0.029,0.751,0.219,0.994,0.2503921568627451,0.4617647058823529,0.3756,1052,94,0.0893536121673003,0,20,False,48,0.074074074074074,0.1851851851851851,0.4074074074074074,0.037037037037037,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.037037037037037,189,123,4.560846560846561,0,0,visit atico restaur locat th floor princip hotel last night alreadi stop afternoon want coffe roof terrac inform without servic close low season return dinner atico restaur small highli recommend reserv done seat place comfort staff amaz help tent main cours got tuna top loin citru fruit blintz friend crunchi socarrat rice duck norway lobster like duck friend meal delici fork constantli plate tuna tataki delici well got coffe love roof terrac howev without servic allow us enter coffe finish dinner coupl drink bar enjoy last madrid dinner much return madrid would definit come back,good review,4

My wife and I decided to give it a go because the menu, to us at least, looked delicious and far preferable to his two star offering. We took the lift to the 6th floor and were greeted warmly by the staff. I factored in some time to have a drink on the terrace before having our lunch. (Top Tip: Lunch time in Spain is very likely to give you a better experience than the evening) The terrace is delightful and provides a relaxing precursor to the main event. The bar is well supplied and they know how to serve a good drink.  The restaurant has a classy, calm and relaxing environment and it's a welcome relief from hustle and bustle of Madrid. We begin events with a selection of croquetas and they are excellent, among the best I've ever had. We both settled for the 'Salad of Contrasts' and it is a quality and refreshing start. For mains I had 'hake baked at low temperature' and my wife had 'tuna loin with citrus fruits.' Both very good indeed and we know we are in a good restaurant. I chose a good bottle of El Hobre Bala from the Madrid region from a decent wine list. The desert selection is surprisingly good for Spain and we chose 'exotic fruits with aged rum'  I have to add that the staff were exceptionally attentive, courteous and friendly throughout. We've been to Madrid many times (my wife is Spanish - Castilian) and this is one of our best dining experiences we've had and possibly the best value meal when the quality is taken into consideration. We tend to eat more modestly but if you fancy something a upmarket, without Michelin miniaturisation or Madrid tourist trap this is a very firm recommendation.",2015-11-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d7779187-Reviews-or80-Atico_Restaurant-Madrid.html,UID_22765,0.012,0.841,0.146,0.9874,0.4259009009009008,0.6324324324324323,0.4963357142857143,1809,158,0.0873410724156992,0,39,False,69,0.2083333333333333,0.1666666666666666,0.2777777777777778,0.0833333333333333,0.1805555555555555,0.0138888888888888,0.0138888888888888,0.0138888888888888,0.0277777777777777,0.0138888888888888,331,201,4.462235649546828,0,0,atico restaur concern doubl michelin star chef ramon freixa situat th floor star princip hotel call de alcala central madrid wife decid give go menu us least look delici far prefer two star offer took lift th floor greet warmli staff factor time drink terrac lunch top tip lunch time spain like give better experi even terrac delight provid relax precursor main event bar well suppli know serv good drink restaur classi calm relax environ welcom relief hustl bustl madrid begin event select croqueta excel among best ever settl salad contrast qualiti refresh start main hake bake low temperatur wife tuna loin citru fruit good inde know good restaur chose good bottl el hobr bala madrid region decent wine list desert select surprisingli good spain chose exot fruit age rum add staff except attent courteou friendli throughout madrid mani time wife spanish castilian one best dine experi possibl best valu meal qualiti taken consider tend eat modestli fanci someth upmarket without michelin miniaturis madrid tourist trap firm recommend,good review,4

They tout the fact that it is Ramón Freixa designed menu, but the connection to a 2 Michelin star chef (at his other restaurant) is not a fair one. Do not expect that sort of quality here. The amuse bouche was actually very good. However beyond that I found the food thoroughly average. The croquetas de jamon were nothing special, you can get the same thing anywhere for half the price. My main course was the biggest offender though. I got the ""Crunchy socarrat rice with duck and Norway lobster"". There was absolutely nothing crunchy about the rice, at all, which is simply unacceptable for socarrat - that is the whole point of it! To have no crunch entirely defeats the dish and this was very disappointing. So overall I would say just not really worth it. Wait staff were good, no issues there, it was the food that disappointed.

Unlikely other restaurants, where after a while, the degustation process can seem a bit tedious... every course here was a delight, and your palate never felt jaded. The technique and expertise in every course was evident, but the chef's ultimate aim was to delight your tastebuds, and not to impress you with superfluous froths, foams and jellies (technique for technique's sake is a distressing malady in some many modern and expensive restaurants nowadays).  The food was always presented beautifully, some of it incredibly witty (our 'egg dessert' and the 'ocean floor' was outstanding).

Many locals filled the place, but that did not stop them from giving us the same first class experience. When Gustavo Montero came by to make sure all was well, we discovered why everything worked together so well. He took care of all the details, including watering the plants. We enjoyed the shrimp, pork tenderloins and salads. Gustavo came by with a treat for dessert - a very sumptuous cheese cake. The evening was capped off with free Spanish Crema!

The service was possibly the best we had in all of Spain. a very interesting variety of dishes that I have never eaten in my entire life. I tried all four of the courses on the menu. I started out with the croquettes, a combination of seafood croquettes and a ham and mushroom version. They were excellent. Next came the octopus tentacle with black squid ink on a bed of crushed potatoes. muy delicioso. the main course was a duck and Norwegian lobster dish on crunchy rice served in a mini paella pan.

We ordered the tuna special upon the waiter's recommendation and I would say that dish was of starred quality. Presentation was creative and the products were top quality. Other dishes we ordered included the soft shell crab, scarmoza raviolo, smoked sardine and corvina with truffle. Everything was exquisite. All the dishes were presented in a creative manner and I can honestly say it's unlike any other food I tried on my trip to Madrid.  The service was friendly and the wines are excellent - we had both red & white, each wine complemented the food perfectly which suggests they have a good sommelier.  If I'm being hyper-critical, there was a bit too much truffle with the corvina, which was a very intense flavour and overpowered the fish slightly. I also think that the pincho of smoked sardine with a tomato salsa and Burrata cheese would work better as two separate tapas as the cheese and sardine are delicious separately but are a bit too rich together.",2020-07-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d779707-Reviews-Juana_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_23611,0.0,0.828,0.172,0.9774,0.4170670995670995,0.6153679653679652,0.435625,1005,80,0.0796019900497512,1,20,False,39,0.0862068965517241,0.2068965517241379,0.2758620689655172,0.1034482758620689,0.1551724137931034,0.0344827586206896,0.0172413793103448,0.0517241379310344,0.0344827586206896,0.0344827586206896,173,119,4.803468208092486,0,0,love surpris place order tuna special upon waiter recommend would say dish star qualiti present creativ product top qualiti dish order includ soft shell crab scarmoza raviolo smoke sardin corvina truffl everyth exquisit dish present creativ manner honestli say unlik food tri trip madrid servic friendli wine excel red white wine complement food perfectli suggest good sommeli hyper critic bit much truffl corvina intens flavour overpow fish slightli also think pincho smoke sardin tomato salsa burrata chees would work better two separ tapa chees sardin delici separ bit rich togeth,very good review,5

Young waitress serving us was pleasant and spoke good English but didn't smile and just seemed a bit under pressure. It is part of a chain and has that feel. The food was good and a reasonable price and our first orders were served quite quickly. Took a bit of time to get a second drink and additional tapas but we weren't in any rush. Compared to another tapas restaurant we ate at the following night this was certainly more like a fast food place than gourmet; but to be fair the food quality was good and so was the price.

Each dish was like a work of art, but also tasted flawless. Many dishes were such interesting combinations of flavor that I had not had before. Everything was cooked perfectly. Everything was fresh.

I wonder why I had not gone to this restaurant before. The tasting menu is absolutely flawless and the food has amazing taste, I think Diego Guerrero finds just the right balance between innovation and cooking food that tastes to food (as opposed to many other chefs that call themselves followers of Adria and cook food that does not taste to food). All the dishes were delicious. There is no a la carte dining, you are offered three different tasting menu options, that vary in the number of dishes to taste and you are asked if you have any food alergies or dislikes. I must confess that I did not like the method so much when it was presented to me, but you have to trust the chef, because every dish that came out of the kitchen was absolutely delicious, both in execution and presentation. The dessert part of the dinner was especially interesting, some of the desserts that I tried are comparable to the ones taht you have in Arzak! Especially the fishbowl (""la pecera"").

In hope rather than expectation we got there at opening time (1 p.m. on a Sunday) and they squeezed us into a corner table. Despite probably being the worst table in the bar, we could not have cared, as the food, service and ambiance more than made up for it and we were just grateful to have been found any table. The food was exceptional and we had the wine recommended by our waiter, which was a perfect accompaniment to the food. We even had to ‘struggle’ with dessert and were very glad we did, as again these were superb.

I had the pleasure to enjoy a meal there two times this year and both times I will remember for the rest of my life. Thanks to Mery Marte and her team! The restaurant is situated in a wonderful historic building at the corner of Plaza Espana. There is a set menu only, but they will ask, whether you have allergies or you do not like special kinds of food.  The food is fresh from the market, innovative, surprising, presented with fantasy and creativity and it tastes delicately like heaven! This time I enjoyed grilled tigerprawns and tiny mussels with special essential oils, a butter fish shot with white asparagus foam, a warm lobster salad with mango guacamole, a reduced soup from onions with a special “cheeseball”, baked turbot with seasonal baby vegetables, a confit suckling pig with shallots reduction, an edible hibiscus flower with foam from Pisco Sour, “Petals”, a fabulous rose flavoured ice cream with green apple sorbet, “Rocks”, chocolate rocks with mint and tonka bean ice cream and finally the “Blackboard” of Petits Fours. Wines are offered by the bottle only, very comprehensive wine list and a sommelier with good recommendations.

Any reviewer that complained about the ""pretentiousness"" or ""small quantities"" or even ""high price"" obviously did no background check (all the information is easily attainable) and was therefore unprepared and not in a position to criticise.  **** SPOILER ALERT !!!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!!! ***** (just in case you want the experience to also be a surprise, stop reading now. Go, eat, smell, taste, enjoy - you'll have an INCREDIBLE time) Still here? I understand: you're like me and want to be completely prepared. Well, I'm writing this review for you then, so here goes! We ordered the 11 course menu. 86 Euros, wine not included. The wine list was extensive and the sommelier was kind, patient and knowledgeable.  We ate: ..ok, I can't give away the first appetizer, because it's too much fun. Suffice to say that it's unexpected and light ;) - the second course was my personal favourite. What looked like a whole truffle on a bed of woodchips was, in fact, a pigeon...meatball. That tasted so good I can still remember it if I think hard enough. And the woodchips? Frozen foie gras, shaved so thin that it literally melted in your mouth. There was also what looked like a yellow flower, and a pea shoot. Which were a yellow flower and a pea shoot. The surprise was under the glass bowl that the course was served in, that was double an held in between the two layers a thick, brown smoke that smelled of forest. Yep. What happened during that course, which as I repeat was my favourite, was that thanks to the skill and passion of the chef (that unfortunately we did not meet) I was transported into a forest. I could go on, but let's move to the next dish. - seafood. Simple, but high quality, seafood: a prawn, a razor clam and two clams. No trick here. The twist however came in the shape of four tiny pipettes that contained four different aromatic oils, that had to be put on the four seafood items to give them a unique and personalised taste. I tried all of them before (I am too curious) and they were all very good. Ah, no cutlery was served with this course... only fingers allowed! - a raviolo. Well, we're Italian, so we frowned on this ""raviolo"" definition, and maybe because of this it was the least exciting of them all. A pea filling with shaved jamon topping and a reduced dewlap (pork cheek) sauce. Good, but not my favourite. Salty. - sardine. However strangely, the things that I remember most of this course were the origano flower (SO tasty! I am going to use flowers in all my dishes from now on) and the apple bites on top. The sardines were very salty and went extremely well with the celeriac cream. The roe was too little (quantity) to judge.  - lobster. Also not a favourite of the evening. Maybe because I've eaten lobster before and the mango guacamole wasn't overwhelmingly interesting. The colours were also a bit off, with the greenish-brown of the guacamole that wasn't a feast for the eyes, really. - turbot. It's a fish. A tasty, buttery fish that was served with a simple arbequina sauce and ... a garlic flower! SO tasty! (did I write that already?). This course was very good, original and interesting.  - Pigeon. The most beautiful course, this pigeon was served with a salad of shoots, nasturtium flowers and laid on a bed of soccarrat truffle rice. Soccarrat is the crunchy part of the paella rice, in this case made ad hoc for the dish. Very good, very beautiful. Loved it. - Dessert n1! A strange pinkish concoction made with a pisco sour foam on top of caramelised hibiscus flower and pistachio crumble. Strange, delicate, sour, sweet... A party in my mouth. - Dessert n2! The most creative of them all: the famous FishBowl! Nemo (the waiter said it was Nemo), that was a marshmallow sitting in a cloud of bubbles, was perched on an underwater ""boulder"" of yoghurt covered with green churro ""algae"" (crunchy, sweet, really good). Behind him rose a ""coral"" of white chocolate covered with raspberry powder and hidden under the boulder was a dark chocolate ""mussel"". This was a feast for the eyes, and for our imagination. - Dessert n3! The least interesting: chocolate rocks. Nothing much to add... tasted (the chef's going to kill m, but..) like Cadbury's Bubbly chocolate. Not exciting but still good. Maybe nothing should be served after the FishBowl. - the last dessert was a blackboard of passionfruit, churros and I can't really remember the last thing. Not bad as a sweet thing to end the dinner but as I said, maybe nothing should be served after the FishBowl.  Done! Now for the service: The waiter we had seemed a bit ""off"" at the beginning, not really smiling and acting all uptight. After the first surprise course however he starting warming up to us and was smiling and laughing by the end :) His English, as has been said, was not fluent but his effort was great and most things were easily understandable.  Every course was served on a unique and original plate - sometimes a stone, sometimes a glass bowl, other times an oddly shaped plate. Every dish was presented in such a way that all senses were stimulated and taken care of. Every moment was incredible, and I was very lucky to be able to share this amazing experience with my friends and family. This is not a dinner, or a lunch. It's an experience, in which the portions are small but many because of the generosity of the chef, that wants to share with his clients many different tastes and combinations.

Madrid is an awesome city with lots of good people and restaurants, but me and my mother was super mistreated by the maitre of that place for absolutely NO REASON. We tried to sit on a table and he roughly asked us to change the table with a mix of bad english speaking with unrecognizable spanish. Then he just (roughly again) throw the menu in our table and ignored us when we tried to ask for the dishes. In less than 5min we got up and left. And he ironically said ""hasta luego"" shaking his hands on a ""bye bye"" movement. I know we all have bad and good days but that was unacceptable for a restaurant like that.

Every one of our choices was delicious - the soft shell crab, the mussels, the volcano cake dessert, but the pick was the wild mushroom, black truffle and egg yolk ravioli which was astonishing. Service was helpful and friendly - our waiter had a great sense of humour and we enjoyed good banter throughout our visit. One word of warning. That picture of the restaurant area on the front page of the website for the venue was taken when the place was closed. Once it opens, the bar area gets very crowded and noisy and the standing guests are pressing up quite close to the tables. They also seem to have a weird system where the guy at the door controlling the numbers still sends people right to the other end of the bar to enquire about a table, only to be told there aren't any - so they have to squeeze past and then squeeze back. The waiters do an amazing job in such cramped conditions. I guess that means this is one of the places to be in Madrid at the moment, but don't go expecting a quiet, relaxed evening. Extroverts will love it, but introverts might feel a bit closed in. Still, I recommend this place for the food and service.",2019-05-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d779707-Reviews-or50-Juana_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_27377,0.028,0.793,0.18,0.9932,0.2356107660455487,0.5229296066252588,0.3999099999999999,1259,111,0.0881652104845115,0,31,False,48,0.0576923076923076,0.1153846153846153,0.2884615384615384,0.0961538461538461,0.1346153846153846,0.0384615384615384,0.0192307692307692,0.0576923076923076,0.1346153846153846,0.0576923076923076,234,163,4.384615384615385,0,0,probabl best tapa week spain take barcelona malaga sevil madrid everi one choic delici soft shell crab mussel volcano cake dessert pick wild mushroom black truffl egg yolk ravioli astonish servic help friendli waiter great sens humour enjoy good banter throughout visit one word warn pictur restaur area front page websit venu taken place close open bar area get crowd noisi stand guest press quit close tabl also seem weird system guy door control number still send peopl right end bar enquir tabl told squeez past squeez back waiter amaz job cramp condit guess mean one place madrid moment go expect quiet relax even extrovert love introvert might feel bit close still recommend place food servic,good review,4

We knew it was rated as one of Madrid’s best restaurants and our concierge recommended reservations, an advice we did not heed sadly. Once inside, the modern decor and the small dining room surprised us. The bar was the focal point of the restaurant and we were greeted by Phillipe. He was the bartender, sommelier, manager all rolled into one. He gave us a table despite no reservations and we were lucky as within a half hour, the place had filled up to more than capacity and folks were clamoring and waiting for a table. But I digress. It’s all about the food. Every single pintxos was excellent. Whether a seafood, meat or veggie dish it was exquisitely prepared with the flair of a Michelin chef. Memorable and notable dishes were the unusual peppers that were roasted, smoked salmon with curry and greens, spinach crepe, Iberian pork loin with sobrasada and gernika peppers were show stoppers. They had an impressive wine list and Phillipe guided us to one of the best wines we had ever had in Spain or anywhere- Ribera del duero.  But the icing on the cake was literally a cake with ice cream. The volcano with its gooey dulce de leche sauce oozing out was to die for. All in all, this was fine dining experience in a classy modern interior in the heart of the bustling city with great food, excellent service and ambience.  Disclaimer: I think the managers name was Phillipe. Can’t be sure.

Unfortunately as much as we wanted it to be phenomenal, it was not. The service was extraordinary and the setting is very elegant. But the food just did not cut it on the evening of our visit. In an interesting start you are given the the three tasting menu selections on a potato based card that you can dip in a mayo sauce. Well it is different, but does it taste good? No not really! The second serving was a small biscuit with a 1/4 inch thick slab of butter. I ate it and wow it tasted like a slab of butter! Hmm if this is the haute cuisine then I guess I need to get use to eating slabs of butter or perhaps I just don't have a clue about haute cuisine!! I assume the chef experiments with each meal and perhaps sometimes you just miss the mark. Unfortunately we just found that one dish after another the flavors presented were not married but in fact clashed. This was apparent as we looked around the room and saw the puzzled look on many of the patrons faces the night of our visit. The desserts were interesting but in my opinion they were not great. Many people have very much enjoyed Club Allard so I will assume that it was an off night for the chef, but in our opinion Nemo was not found on the evening of our visit!!",2013-11-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or320-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_18609,0.05,0.83,0.12,0.9742,0.2431901041666666,0.5457638888888888,0.4903733333333334,1418,148,0.1043723554301833,6,24,False,47,0.1034482758620689,0.1724137931034483,0.4137931034482758,0.0689655172413793,0.2068965517241379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0344827586206896,0.0,273,163,4.197802197802198,1,0,high hope ta rate restaur madrid particularli one best meal ever experienc night barcelona restaur montiel unfortun much want phenomen servic extraordinari set eleg food cut even visit interest start given three tast menu select potato base card dip mayo sauc well differ tast good realli second serv small biscuit inch thick slab butter ate wow tast like slab butter hmm haut cuisin guess need get use eat slab butter perhap clue haut cuisin assum chef experi meal perhap sometim miss mark unfortun found one dish anoth flavor present marri fact clash appar look around room saw puzzl look mani patron face night visit dessert interest opinion great mani peopl much enjoy club allard assum night chef opinion nemo found even visit,bad review,2

The maitre’d said he would have a table in 40 minutes so we ventured out for an aperitif as the bar was extremely busy and noisy (great buzz). On returning 45 minutes later we only had to wait a couple of minutes for our table, which was at the back of the restaurant and a bit more tranquil. The waiter, from Bulgaria, was very helpful and offered us very good advice on choice and quantity. We chose the famous tortilla, suckling pig and a special mushroom dish.

So it is very difficult to come across a place that is outstanding in every single way. This to me is Juana la Loca. From the minute we were received at the entrance to the last goodbye from our incredible master table host Diego... the experience was flawless. Juana la loca has truly made an art of taking the well known classics of Spanish tapas and regional dishes and turning them into quasi religious experiences ;-) From the wine list (very intelligent and well chosen selections including the Alvaro Palacios wines) to the offers on the menu Juana la loca truly allows you to choose fantastic culinary journeys. And this is still without talking about desserts which are out of this world. From the gingered Carrot cake to the overflowing 'dulce de leche' lava cake you are truly in for a treat. But I do have to say that at least half of the experience was crafted by Diego our table consultant hahahaha.

A previous review on TA suggested that this place is good for vegetarians.  It's a small place with a bar and was very busy with mainly Spanish clientele (a good sign in my book). Despite being busy we were greeted quickly and warmly by a waiter named Alex who then took care of us. His English was impeccable and he was talkative and very friendly. My children and I felt immediately at ease. He helped us pick out 5 vegetarian items (some contained eggs but we're OK with eggs). The food was hot and tasty and of good portion size. The bread was soft and fresh and I had 2 Sangrias which were very fruity. We heard the deserts were good and we ordered a homemade chocolate cake which Alex said his sister made. I don't know if he was pulling my leg but the cake was definitely home-made and delicious! Truly.  We left feeling very happy. The food was great with plenty of options for us. Service was excellent, thanks to Alex primarily. Ambience was great. All in all we had a thoroughly good meal and experience.  I can't express how much good service is important to a dining experience. Here it was great and made a good meal a great and enjoyable experience too. Well done Taberna el Sur!!

We ordered about 5 or 6 different ones and 1 dessert and it was all excellent. Pricey, especially considering how affordable a lot of restaurants in La Latina are, but I guess that comes with ""sophisticated"" dishes. The two dishes that really stood out for us were the black truffle sea bass ""tiradito"" and the strigoli with truffle carbonara. The sea bass was incredible and melts in your melt. The truffle was interesting in the sauce, in a really good way. We were definitely scraping the sauce when all the fish was gone. The strigoli was also amazing and creamy, not too heavy if you're splitting the dish. The restaurant is extremely popular for people dining at tables and at the bar for pintxos. Tried to walk in around 10pm in June, not realizing it was a Friday and it was packed. Tried again a couple weeks later for dinner on a weekday just after opening. The restaurant was empty except one table and most table had reserved signs. I believe we got 1 of the 3 non-reserved tables and the wait staff still needed to ask the manager. We were lucky to sit and the non-reserved tables filled up shortly after us and reserved table not long into our meal. So definitely recommend coming at opening time or reserve your table. I'd say the service was good. Some of the staff may come off disrespectful to some but I think it's just them being quick with their interactions in an extremely packed and loud restaurant. They still managed to come around the tables fairly often, which isn't really expected in Spain. The manager also takes the time to go around the table to ask about your experience and explain some of the dishes. All in all, slightly overpriced and the ambience too busy for my taste but I would definitely come back to try other dishes.",2019-10-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d779707-Reviews-or20-Juana_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_27438,0.006,0.864,0.13,0.9937,0.1974537037037037,0.5502314814814815,0.2923526315789473,1822,160,0.0878155872667398,0,37,False,86,0.173076923076923,0.0961538461538461,0.25,0.0769230769230769,0.1346153846153846,0.0384615384615384,0.0384615384615384,0.0192307692307692,0.0961538461538461,0.0769230769230769,329,192,4.541033434650456,0,0,food mix modern spanish dish pintxo order differ one dessert excel pricey especi consid afford lot restaur la latina guess come sophist dish two dish realli stood us black truffl sea bass tiradito strigoli truffl carbonara sea bass incred melt melt truffl interest sauc realli good way definit scrape sauc fish gone strigoli also amaz creami heavi split dish restaur extrem popular peopl dine tabl bar pintxo tri walk around pm june realiz friday pack tri coupl week later dinner weekday open restaur empti except one tabl tabl reserv sign believ got non reserv tabl wait staff still need ask manag lucki sit non reserv tabl fill shortli us reserv tabl long meal definit recommend come open time reserv tabl say servic good staff may come disrespect think quick interact extrem pack loud restaur still manag come around tabl fairli often realli expect spain manag also take time go around tabl ask experi explain dish slightli overpr ambienc busi tast would definit come back tri dish,average review,3

I did not stay enough to say anything about it :-) I was just passing by, alone, on normal Saturday lunchtime and Madrid.  I look at Google Maps in my phone where I bookmark places I like or I wish to go. I had Juana la Loca bookmarked. I cannot remember if someone tipped it to me or if I just read it somewhere. I decided to go for it. Just before I get in, a group of three people entered the restaurant, so I had to stand by for some seconds. The restaurant had some people in the bar, gladly enjoying their meals, I could see an empty table that properly marked as reserved. It was 13:30 which is quite early lunchtime for Madrid standards. I had no rush, my program for today was to hit the streets and enjoy the beautiful early Madrid autumn. I asked for a table to one of the employees, and he politely told me that I should go a meet the manager who is in charge of arranging the seats. The manager, just came in from a room that I could not see. I asked that I was looking for a table and then i clarified it was just for me. He told me “I am sorry. But you have to wait 25m for a table or get a place in the bar”. I told him “that’s fine for me, I can squeeze myself on the bar but first I need to go to the toilet”. He answered back that I had to go to the same room where he came in from before. I walked in and I saw a room with 3/4 empty tables not marked as reserved. And the group that just came before me already accommodated. That moment I just realized the guy was greedily trying to put in the bar while not giving me a table that it was what I asked. Why “waste” a table for two with one guy that could eat at the bar? Rule number #1 in business and specially on services: empathy. I just felt like being another credit card and not as a person. You can have great food or not, amazing decor or be the most tide up place, but I don’t eat where I don’t feel welcomed. Maybe it was just a bad day or even a bad moment. I don’t know but I will not find out. I used the toilet an left, thank you for that.",2019-10-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d779707-Reviews-or20-Juana_La_Loca-Madrid.html,UID_27439,0.061,0.864,0.075,0.6745,0.0854497354497354,0.4838183421516754,0.3607153846153845,2137,242,0.1132428638277959,0,50,False,78,0.0576923076923076,0.1153846153846153,0.3076923076923077,0.0,0.1538461538461538,0.0576923076923076,0.0961538461538461,0.0384615384615384,0.1346153846153846,0.0384615384615384,440,229,3.856818181818182,1,0,look info food decor atmospher price juana la loca need read stay enough say anyth pass alon normal saturday lunchtim madrid look googl map phone bookmark place like wish go juana la loca bookmark cannot rememb someon tip read somewher decid go get group three peopl enter restaur stand second restaur peopl bar gladli enjoy meal could see empti tabl properli mark reserv quit earli lunchtim madrid standard rush program today hit street enjoy beauti earli madrid autumn ask tabl one employe polit told go meet manag charg arrang seat manag came room could see ask look tabl clarifi told sorri wait tabl get place bar told fine squeez bar first need go toilet answer back go room came walk saw room empti tabl mark reserv group came alreadi accommod moment realiz guy greedili tri put bar give tabl ask wast tabl two one guy could eat bar rule number busi special servic empathi felt like anoth credit card person great food amaz decor tide place eat feel welcom mayb bad day even bad moment know find use toilet left thank,bad review,2

So we decided to go inside, even though it seemed packed. It was packed, after all it was Saturday night, so we had to wait '15 till a table was available, which was fine. While waiting we sat at the bar and ordered some beers, to which the friendly bar-woman added a bowl of tasty olives. Our waiting time was very pleasant and gave us a chance to observe the interior, which gave me a warm feeling. It's walls were filled with Pedro Almodovar's movie posters, and there was a mixed crowd of young and older people. In general I got the impression that this was an honest, relaxed and fun place to be.  The staff was very friendly and relaxed, and our server, Alejandro, was a truly fun guy who spoke good english. What a surprise that he too had links to Charlotte, North Carolina. The world is a truly small place! In any case, despite the place being very busy, we felt like he was taking good care of us. Our food was very, very, tasty, I had the grilled baby squid with salad. Highly recommended. I also asked for a glass of white wine, and it was very good. Overhearing conversations with other customers I got the impression that they knew about wine and seemed like they have a good wine selection. The only downside was that we sat at the smallest table in the place, and since I'm a big guy and probably would have felt more comfortable in a bigger one. But since already I was in the mood for anything, and since we didn't have to wait longer for a bigger table, I was satisfied. Last, the prices were really great. I thought I'd spend at least 20 euro per person, what with the drinks etc. But it turned out to be almost half of that!  Overall a great place to have your dinner!

It was truly memorable, mostly excellent, some parts outstanding, some parts 'only' very good. The treatment and service was perfectly friendly and helpful, including car parking with the car efficiently brought back on time. If you are used to top class restaurants (we're not really) you might miss even more waiters ready to react at every move, we felt perfectly happy with what was provided. As you probably knew before reading this, having dinner at Club Allard or similar restaurants is nothing like a standard meal, instead you partake in a sort of organized trip through the culinary world of the specific chef. In this case part of the emphasis is on the peculiar presentation like the famous fake egg for dessert, part on the taste. The latter was unbelievably good for some dishes, while a few others remained just below maximal grades. Contrary to some other reviews, we were for example a bit less enamoured of the desserts, considering the starters the most rewarding part of the menu. We were offered a set of wines by the glass to go with the menu. These wines were all very nice, but only one I'd consider a true relevation. Given the quality of the food and the service, the price level was still relatively reasonable – keeping in mind with what you compare with.  Overall we enjoyed this dinner more than a much more expensive one in a 3-star restaurant many years ago and will definitely consider coming back for a special occasion.",2013-11-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or320-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27450,0.016,0.819,0.165,0.9901,0.2395119047619047,0.5335773809523809,0.5245727272727272,1575,123,0.078095238095238,0,33,False,55,0.1285714285714285,0.1714285714285714,0.3142857142857143,0.0714285714285714,0.2,0.0142857142857142,0.0142857142857142,0.0285714285714285,0.0428571428571428,0.0142857142857142,274,182,4.748175182481752,0,0,read lot club allard press recent final came around actual go tri experi truli memor mostli excel part outstand part good treatment servic perfectli friendli help includ car park car effici brought back time use top class restaur realli might miss even waiter readi react everi move felt perfectli happi provid probabl knew read dinner club allard similar restaur noth like standard meal instead partak sort organ trip culinari world specif chef case part emphasi peculiar present like famou fake egg dessert part tast latter unbeliev good dish other remain maxim grade contrari review exampl bit less enamour dessert consid starter reward part menu offer set wine glass go menu wine nice one consid true relev given qualiti food servic price level still rel reason keep mind compar overal enjoy dinner much expens one star restaur mani year ago definit consid come back special occas,good review,4

The place is empty and silent; and one can really enjoy the email before dumb business people glued to their mobile phones enter your blissful realm. Let me start by stating that the meal was excellent. There was no dish that was disappointing. I decided to go for the big 17 course meal. Well worth it. Plan about 2.5h for the whole experience. People that complain about the experience should simply avoid haute cuisine because they are clueless. Sorry. The big highlight were the desserts. Absolutely out of this world. So good, that I had them 3 times (overall 7 desserts). Yes, I am a sucker when it comes to sweets. But let me tell you: the egg is absolutely stunning/surprising/delicious. True food porn. Shell is chocolate, white is panna cotta, yolk is mango coulis. Impossible to tell the difference to a real egg, until you try it. Yes, I will be back. Thank you, staff of El Club Allard, for (a) coping with my dietary requirements and (b) fixation on desserts. Truly a memorable experience. Some small gripes for a place of this category: No wine pairing, no wines by the glass, linens could be higher quality, sometimes the cutlery did not match the food (steak knife for fish?), my wine glass had a crack in the stem, door to toilet needs to be fixed.",2013-11-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or320-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27451,0.073,0.786,0.141,0.9606,0.0798387096774193,0.4453917050691244,0.436352380952381,1360,102,0.075,0,53,False,46,0.140625,0.171875,0.21875,0.046875,0.171875,0.03125,0.03125,0.015625,0.140625,0.03125,242,178,4.62396694214876,0,0,get earli pm ye earli spanish standard definit good idea place empti silent one realli enjoy email dumb busi peopl glu mobil phone enter bliss realm let start state meal excel dish disappoint decid go big cours meal well worth plan h whole experi peopl complain experi simpli avoid haut cuisin clueless sorri big highlight dessert absolut world good time overal dessert ye sucker come sweet let tell egg absolut stun surpris delici true food porn shell chocol white panna cotta yolk mango couli imposs tell differ real egg tri ye back thank staff el club allard cope dietari requir b fixat dessert truli memor experi small gripe place categori wine pair wine glass linen could higher qualiti sometim cutleri match food steak knife fish wine glass crack stem door toilet need fix,very good review,5

There were three set menus on offer and we chose the middle set menu (13 courses!!) at 98 Euros a head. If I go into detail here it will spoil the excitement and surprise at some of the items and experiences that el club Allard has in store for their customer. Please take my word for it . This is an eating experience not to be missed. Chef Diego Guerrero is quite simply a genius! To whet your appetite one of the appetisers was a game truffle with foie and mushrooms. The egg with bread and pancetta served over a light potato cream sauce is incredible.

The food was so good here that we went for dinner one evening and lunch the next day. I had a salad each time and tried some of the other entrees too. The sangria was also quite enjoyable. Everything we tried was delicious. My husband's favorite was the curry chicken. He continues to talk about it even now that we have returned home. It was his favorite dish of our entire vacation. We have also recommended this restaurant to family members to try when they were in Madrid, and they loved it just as much as we did.

The service is very professional, without being overbearing. There are three menu options, differing only in the number of appetizer courses. All the courses are innovative and artfully put together. I must admit that the first bite with the name card that tastes like hostia was not a success on taste or texture, but nevertheless a interesting start. The subsequent dishes never disappointed an eager diner. Among the dishes, the foie gras and baby lamb were simply outstanding. All other dishes were visually stunning with good taste to match, and disserts were amazing. The poached egg was one of the most spectacular dishes. The wine list is extensive and the prices are quite reasonable for the wines on the list. I wish there were a wine pairing available. It’s just too different to find a few wines that fit the large number of courses. Overall this now ranks among my top dining experiences and I recommend it highly.

We were appealed by the very good location and photos on the menu. Unfortunately, the dishes turned out to be quite different from the pictures: Bellota slices were too thick, beef was burnt, and patatas bravas were hard. We sent back the beef, which was hard as a shoe sole and tasted like dirt. When it came back it was literally raw... Service was extremely poor: we had to ask 5 times for the wifi code, nobody was willing to give it to us. When time came to pay, we asked 3 times for the bill and had to wait 45 minutes to receive it. It had 2 mistakes on it, adding up to more than 10 euros so make sure you double check your bill. We found they have their way to overcharge you: we ordered some bread with tomato and olive oil, since there was 2 of us, they automatically charged us 2 portions (which means 6 slices of bread, of course we left half of it) and when we questioned the bill they told us we should have precised we wanted only one serving...

It locates at a major Madrid commercial district, the gran via, opposite metro station Gallao and magnificent Senator gran via hotel. A handsomely bearded waiter named Josu spoke very good English and thus gave us some quite needed help. To be fair, people there waiting tables used English quite often, so tourists can feel relieved in ordering dishes they want and portions they could consume, rather than wasting. Josu correctly explained the drink we saw many other people drinking, the rose-colored sangria. We had tried asking waiters at other places since we got to Madrid, but often got confused and gave up. This time we tasted it, and it is quite pleasant, for having tapas or just lessening thurst under the sun. The venue offers a variety of tapas choices, mostly delicious, good for tourists who did not intend to venture into places like San Miguel to taste local tapas, and the location is so convenient that you can hardly miss it while joining crowds around this central Madrid commercial district.

First the most impressive part of our dinner: the excellent sommelier guided us through the lengthy meal with five wine selections (bottles) of his choice - all matching the food superbly and providing most pleasurable drinking experiences. We were prepared to pay dearly for this fine selection and were pleasantly surprised that our expert guide had selected bottles averaging about 33 Euros! A steal! I was unable to order wine from the grotesquely overpriced wine lists of New York and Philadelphia restaurants for months. To the food: Club Allard's menu has many playful ideas, ranging from lovely trompe d'oeil dishes to enticing ""molecular"" bites, interspersed, however, with some less exciting ideas. The menu-eating conceit should yield a more intense opening gustatory experience, as other reviews confirm, instead of providing, in my case, a slightly sacrilegious feeling of breaking a large host. The same lack of scintillation afflicted a couple more dishes in the long parade of the ""Revolution"" menu, however, most selections were truly outstanding in quality and preparation and were a delightful treat together with the wines. It must be said that for a two-star Michelin restaurant with all the elegant trappings and generous staffing, the prices of the menus are very reasonable, making the quality/price ratio an excellent one.

My preference not to eat fish or crustaceans was informed by me at the restaurant, when my order was taken, not previously, yet my preference was fully accommodated in what I was served, and at the end of our meal I was given a printed menu reflecting exactly what I had been served, not what was served to everybody else who ordered the same tasting menu but did not have the same preference as I. Very impressive.  Service was very good, but some minor details can be improved, such as offering more wine and / or water when my cup was empty. Twice I had to ask for more because it was not offered to me.  In summary I fully recommend El Club Allard to those who want and appreciate a truly sophisticated gourmet dinning experience.",2013-12-04,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or310-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27017,0.012,0.79,0.199,0.9889,0.3731372549019608,0.4864705882352941,0.5068666666666667,891,90,0.101010101010101,0,16,False,23,0.0833333333333333,0.125,0.375,0.0833333333333333,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0416666666666666,0.0416666666666666,0.0,163,106,4.45398773006135,0,0,el club allard gourmet din best tast menu verit parad delicaci excel other even better prefer eat fish crustacean inform restaur order taken previous yet prefer fulli accommod serv end meal given print menu reflect exactli serv serv everybodi els order tast menu prefer impress servic good minor detail improv offer wine water cup empti twice ask offer summari fulli recommend el club allard want appreci truli sophist gourmet din experi,very good review,5

I went into El Sur on my own after reading the reviews and visiting the American hairdresser at No 8. If you need a hairdresser in Madrid he is your guy. He is just lovely.  As soon as I went into El Sur Alex greeted me straight away and seated me at a table. Asked was I having drinks or drinks and dinner. He presented me with an English menu. At home I normally let the people who know order for me and I did the same here. I was delighted with the beef which he recommended. He said to only order a half portion and the prawns. If I wanted more it was not going to be a problem. He was right it was enough.  I asked him to recommend a White Wine which he did and it was lovely. Then I had the cheesecake! Absolutely Devine.  Jasmine came with bread and chatted to me for a while which I thought was really nice as I was having dinner alone. She offered more bread and gave me recommendations of where to go in the city.  I was tempted to go back again tonight but decided to wait until I'm back in Madrid later in the year.  A great experience! It does not look like a job for Alex and Jasmine they look and act so happy that I thought they actually owned the place but they don't! I hope their boss appreciates them. I certainly did.  Thank you for a great evening. ,2016-07-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2527526-Reviews-or1960-Taberna_el_Sur-Madrid.html,UID_27522,0.036,0.809,0.155,0.9884,0.3069302721088435,0.4976615646258503,0.3729347826086956,1307,148,0.1132364192807957,3,26,False,51,0.2051282051282051,0.1282051282051282,0.2564102564102564,0.1025641025641025,0.1282051282051282,0.0,0.0,0.0256410256410256,0.0769230769230769,0.0769230769230769,259,154,4.023166023166024,0,0,great place review right went el sur read review visit american hairdress need hairdress madrid guy love soon went el sur alex greet straight away seat tabl ask drink drink dinner present english menu home normal let peopl know order delight beef recommend said order half portion prawn want go problem right enough ask recommend white wine love cheesecak absolut devin jasmin came bread chat thought realli nice dinner alon offer bread gave recommend go citi tempt go back tonight decid wait back madrid later year great experi look like job alex jasmin look act happi thought actual own place hope boss appreci certainli thank great even,good review,4

My favorites were the fried soft shell crabs, three small crabs that tasted amazing and were beautifully presented; another favorite was the egg-inside-pastry with pancetta; the lubina fish and lamb dishes were perfectly cooked. The menu is inventive and the waiter did a great job presenting and explaining each dish. At the end, Meri Marte, the Dominican-born chef that took over this restaurant in 2013, came to our table.

The courses are dainty but we didn't leave feeling hungry. The meal took around 2 1/2 hours and was a wonderful experience overall. An additional thing which impressed me was that although they kept topping us up with wine, they weren't heavy handed and our aperitif and bottle of wine lasted the meal.

Unique place, amazing food experience, absolutely awesome that's only few words we heard from our spanish friends.  My I have been expecting too much or that was not the best day of restaurant team although I am bit disepointed. And I will split my evaluation into two separate parts: 1. food show - the way dishes were served 2. taste  food show - absolutly worth to see. Each dish is masterpiece. The way it is served is realy awesome. For sure worth to see and pay.  ""Funtastic"" dessert called egg is something you will remeber till death.

Don't make the mistake that this is some sort of left field experimental dining but rather an extraordinary high end journey with each dish continuing to leave you gobsmacked. It just gets better and better with an extraordinary desert (s) finale. Too much detail will ruin the experience for you although it is suffice to say my wife and I left pondering whether we had ever eaten a better meal ( and we have had the privilege at eating at more than six 3 Michellin star and a dozen or so other starred restaurants). This restaurant needs to be on the the ""must do"" list in Madrid and certainly deserving of a third star. On cost, it is not cheap nor ridiculous and for me one of the most pleasing aspects were the varied pricing on the wine list from 25 euros and upwards. A refreshing change from those establishments who seem to want to compete with eath other on having the most complex and unaffordable lists! If I had one criticism it would be that although the service met and exceeded every other expectation, I was surprised the table napkins were neither replaced nor re folded at any point including when my wife and I left the table together for the bathroom. Finally don't make the mistake of arriving too early. The restaurant opens at 9.00 pm and we arrived at 9.15pm and were the first with other diners continuing to arrive until around 11.00pm.

Our waiters looked after us superbly from start to finish. Best gin and tonic I ever had. We booked it well in advance as my wife has coeliac disease and cannot eat wheat, barley or oat gluten. When we arrived they were completely ready for us making 3 types of gluten free bread as well as everything else gluten free. Most restaurants would try to simplify this kind of meal so that it was easy for them but not the Club Allard. The attention to detail on every course was excellent. We had the Seduction menu. As expected in such a style of menu there were some parts that were not something we would have chosen again but this in no way detracted from the experience or quality. Our bill was around 300 euro and it was worth every bit. Congratulations to your team in both the kitchen and front of house.

Portion sizes were really good, so as I was dining solo, I didn't want to order a lot. I started with their cold tomato soup (like a gazpacho), then ordered the grilled Octopus (pulpo) which was fantastic. Again, large portions, and a subtly grilled flavour. The pulpo was on a separate menu for their specials, so it may/may not available all the time. My meal was finished with a complimentary mocha liqueur shot from the bartender.

We decided to skip the tennis one evening and take dinner at El Club Allard. I am so glad we did. The restaurant is in an unassuming building and not in what I think of as the center. However, there was a doorman who ushered us in. Upon entry, we were in this spacious, elegant restaurant full of elegant looking people. Service was corrrect and prompt. We were presented with their famous menu, which is edible and made of some type of edible paper.  The wine list was nice and reasonably priced, as was the food. Really compared to Paris or New York this place is a bargain. Fine food. Interesting presentations. Some dishes were really standouts. Fine service. Elegant atmosphere. We were very pleased. Our only disappointment was to learn that the chef had changed and the original chef has left to open his own establishment.  Highly recommended.

We ordered Menu rendezvous (86 euros) which consists of Txangurro de cáscara bland (soft chell crab), 2 snacks (game truffle with foie and mushrooms, Pea's ravioli with iberique dewlap), 2 starters (cold cherry soup with herring caviar, egg with bread served over a light potato cream sauce), 1 fish dish (skrey with rhubarb chutney and spring onion), 1 meat dish (confit suckling pig with echelon onion compote), 1 dessert appetizer (hibicus flower with pisco sour), 2 desserts (the fishbowl, chocolate rocks) then we had a coffee and petit fours which is called the black board.  I, personally, think it was a great meal but not all of the dishes have wowed me. Only the game truffle, the egg and the fishbowl (which are mainly white chocolate mousse) are really impressive. The rest, however, are great, well-cooked and interesting but the taste reached the michelin level but not wow.  The blackboard which are mash mellows, jelly and crackers with ginger flavours are not that good for my taste. The chocolate rocks (chocolate with mint dessert) has too strong chocolate flavour. However, the good point of the desserts here is that they are not TOO sweet nor a sugar bomb. The service was correct and proper. The waiters spoke good english and kindly explained us everything. The drinks were't included and since two of us don't drink, we decided to go for water. (5.5 euros/bottle).  Overall it was great meal with great deal.

First of all, the service was truly amazing. There was a different person for each type of service: an excellent sommelier (wine guy), a menu guy, a serving girl, and another two people providing the best service ever. The wine menu was huge but we had great help picking out cava, white wine and dessert wine. We got to pick between 3 food menus, the difference being the number of courses. We chose the middle one costing 98 euros pp as I see most of the people on TA also picked. We got 12 different courses traveling through all the areas of vegetables and meat that you can imagine, and they all both looked and tasted amazing. Luckily the portions were small so that I could eat all of them, though I was pretty full when I went home.

More of a high end feel to it and the dishes have a uniqueness through fusion of many geographical areas. We started with the “juicy, potato, eggs and confit onion Spanish tortilla” which was good although it was served at room temperature. It was good although probably not “world famous “ as the menu proclaims. My wife and daughter ordered the Grilled Duck foie grass which they are still raving about 4 hours later. We had the black truffled sea bass which was sashimi style and very good.

The restaurant is in a lovely old building and you have to know it is there because there is no signage, but there is a doorman to ensure you are a bona fide customer. Inside there is old world elegance. Large well spaced tables with white linen clothes. The staff are all very helpful and attentive. We went for the Seduction menu at 98 euros pp totalling 11 courses. 3 canapés, 3 starters, 2 mains, 1 dessert appetiser and 2 desserts. We also opted for the matched wines and the sommelier was more than willing to explain his choices and engage in discussion after the course. His choices by an large were very good, only one was over powered by the richness of the food. The portions are thankfully tiny but even so we were very full at the end. There was quite a lot of fish features and the courses were full of creative artistry. One starter was a pigeon fois gras made to look like a truffle with a mushroom crumb for soil, one of the desserts looked like a hens egg laying straw. The straw was coconut strands, the egg shell was pigmented white chocolate, the egg white was coconut panacotta and the egg yolk mango cream and broken in the dish looked exactly like a soft boiled egg. The artistry at every course was outstanding but then so was the quality of the textures and flavours, matched perfectly with fine wines. A 2 Michelin star restaurant is always going to be expensive, but I consider the experience good value at less than 300 euros for two. The whole event was a memorable end to our holiday, a truly outstanding restaurant.",2014-06-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or260-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27603,0.016,0.77,0.214,0.9973,0.2675345622119816,0.5328648233486943,0.3547400000000001,1646,138,0.0838396111786148,0,27,False,60,0.1264367816091954,0.1839080459770115,0.2988505747126437,0.0689655172413793,0.160919540229885,0.0229885057471264,0.0114942528735632,0.0229885057471264,0.0689655172413793,0.0344827586206896,302,186,4.453642384105961,0,0,chose restaur mani madrid offer choic three tast menu restaur love old build know signag doorman ensur bona fide custom insid old world eleg larg well space tabl white linen cloth staff help attent went seduct menu euro pp total cours canap starter main dessert appetis dessert also opt match wine sommeli will explain choic engag discuss cours choic larg good one power rich food portion thank tini even full end quit lot fish featur cours full creativ artistri one starter pigeon foi gra made look like truffl mushroom crumb soil one dessert look like hen egg lay straw straw coconut strand egg shell pigment white chocol egg white coconut panacotta egg yolk mango cream broken dish look exactli like soft boil egg artistri everi cours outstand qualiti textur flavour match perfectli fine wine michelin star restaur alway go expens consid experi good valu less euro two whole event memor end holiday truli outstand restaur,good review,4

Tapas wouldn’t usually be our first choice but the meal was so good that the 4 of us had to return a few nights later. The service was fantastic on both occasions and although we were warned we were ordering a lot of food, we felt the need to try just about everything.  The Salmorejo tapas, the Musaka, the ceasar salad and several specials, including octopus and sirloin steak were among our favourite dishes. Would also recommend their Sangria as it was my personal fav of the trip.  The prices were very reasonable considering how much we ordered.

The presentation and flavours of all the courses are a sensory delight. I would defy anyone not be overwhelmingly impressed by the signature ‘egg’ dessert, it’s truly a culinary masterpiece.  The only reason I cannot give it the full 5 stars is based on the atmosphere and overall welcome. Perhaps some of the explanations of each course were just lost in translation and I felt as if we were doing the venue a favour by allowing us to eat there.   Guests appear to eat in silence; its atmosphere more akin to a monastery at mealtime. The staff, though clearly very professional and thorough, serve as if they are working in a morgue rather than a two Michelin-starred restaurant! They appear wooden, clinical and not at all relaxed. It’s also unusual for this style of gastronomic extravaganza not to offer any paired wines with each course which is somewhat disappointing.  I don’t think I have ever been to a similarly highly regarded establishment where you have to wait until exactly the required opening time before you are allowed in, nor is there an area in which to enjoy an aperitif or after dinner coffee or tea, the choices of which by the way are equally as diverse as the food. My advice is if you have the opportunity to eat here then do so, it really is an extravagant culinary experience and is not number one in Madrid without good reason, however expect a tepid welcome and dreary atmosphere that way the food will be the focus of your attention which is probably the objective anyway.",2014-06-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or260-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_27618,0.052,0.841,0.107,0.9604,0.2502651515151515,0.4562121212121212,0.34367,1607,149,0.0927193528313627,1,22,False,40,0.1012658227848101,0.0886075949367088,0.3417721518987341,0.050632911392405,0.2025316455696202,0.0126582278481012,0.0126582278481012,0.0253164556962025,0.1012658227848101,0.0632911392405063,283,184,4.667844522968198,0,0,gather previou review remark dine experi present flavour cours sensori delight would defi anyon overwhelmingli impress signatur egg dessert truli culinari masterpiec reason cannot give full star base atmospher overal welcom perhap explan cours lost translat felt venu favour allow us eat guest appear eat silenc atmospher akin monasteri mealtim staff though clearli profession thorough serv work morgu rather two michelin star restaur appear wooden clinic relax also unusu style gastronom extravaganza offer pair wine cours somewhat disappoint think ever similarli highli regard establish wait exactli requir open time allow area enjoy aperitif dinner coffe tea choic way equal divers food advic opportun eat realli extravag culinari experi number one madrid without good reason howev expect tepid welcom dreari atmospher way food focu attent probabl object anyway,very good review,5

The food was without a doubt the best I've had in Madrid, and I don't think the amount will leave anyone hungry, although I'm known for not eating a lot. I think it took more than two hours for the whole dinner, as they bring the dishes one by one to the table. It's been a while, so I can't remember most of the dishes, but everything was very original and delicious. They spoke English and Spanish. The service was top notch, which you'd expect for the price anyway.

We chose the ""Seduction"" menu and as each plate was filled with beautiful food that tasted sublime, but small portions, we did not find it overwhelming.  We were there for the food and were very happy with that part of the experience. However I have to say that we found the decor of the dining room rather cold (it is located in a magnificent old building and has very high ceilings) and the serving staff seemed rather cold as well - which in Spain is somewhat unusual. It would have been nice to see the chef because we left with a feeling that the staff were not really enjoying what they were doing, which is a shame - because they are giving us truly delicious food and should be proud and happy to do so.",2014-05-17,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1019405-Reviews-or280-El_Club_Allard-Madrid.html,UID_1495,0.046,0.722,0.232,0.9905,0.3230515151515151,0.806160606060606,0.244575,854,85,0.0995316159250585,1,17,False,33,0.1016949152542373,0.2203389830508474,0.2711864406779661,0.0338983050847457,0.1694915254237288,0.0169491525423728,0.0338983050847457,0.0338983050847457,0.0847457627118644,0.0338983050847457,163,105,4.2392638036809815,0,0,everi dish new experi well explain seriou waiter delici keep look menu live chose seduct menu plate fill beauti food tast sublim small portion find overwhelm food happi part experi howev say found decor dine room rather cold locat magnific old build high ceil serv staff seem rather cold well spain somewhat unusu would nice see chef left feel staff realli enjoy shame give us truli delici food proud happi,bad review,2

La Latina is packed with bars and restaurants, one of the most popular of which is Juana La Loca. It is a cute neighborhood gem. We went in almost 11pm and they were still packed. They call themselves a pintxo bar but the food goes above and beyond the conventional pintxo. We were seated right away despite not having a reservation. Just had to try their tortilla de patata. We ordered pintxos dishes were all bold and tasty in their own way, they were all still light enough to pair well with wine. Try their famous dish the tortilla de patatas: a buttery, melt-in-the-mouth tortilla, finished with a crispy outer layer and served on top of a slice of bread. The huevos rotos also delicious, either to share or as a ración for yourself: crispy, chewy, buttery fries topped with melting fried egg, small salty strips of jamón, salted pimientos de padrón and a shake of paprika, all served on a long plate. It’s a little pricey to dine here but a nice treat when visiting Madrid! It is CASH only. It’s a small wine bar/restaurant and fills up quickly in the evenings.

When we arrived (a Thursday night) the relatively small restaurant was already full so we sat at the bar for a drink whilst we waited for a table to become free. When we did get a table, the service was extremely prompt with the food arriving in good time. And the food - wow! Highlights were the croquettes, steak dish and the pork in a red wine jus. To be honest, all the food was fantastic. But, coupled with this the staff at Taberna el Sur were just brilliant. Alex and Edison did everything they could to make sure we had a brilliant evening.

I have been to a few Michelin 1* restaurants before, this was my first 2* experience so my expectations were high, especially given the #1 rating on TA.  The presentation of each dish (we had the Rendezvous menu) was stunning, edible works of art - in particular the ""fishbowl"" dessert. But the intensity of taste that I was hoping for to match the beautiful presentation wasn't there in every dish. For example, the edible menu card looked great and was a novelty, but it didn't actually taste of much (hence the need for the dipping sauce). I feel bad saying that I was disappointed, as the dining room was beautiful and the serving staff friendly, professional and efficient.  Thanks to other TA reviews, I knew that there was no sign outside the restaurant. Look for the building number (looks like a private apartment building), and once you go into the lobby, you'll see a plaque for the restaurant.

The food is “fine dining” but the seating is “ diner style” small tables. I recommend this Taberna for lunch or late night quick meal. Taberna el Sur is not closed like many restaurants from 2:00 to 5:00pm. The menu is chock full of Spanish favorites as well as few Greek favorites. Moussaka is a winner. A Friday lunch time crowd favorite is the paella topped with a large delicious langostino. Our favorites here are sautéed baby squid and grilled octopus. No worries. If you like chicken, fish, pork, etc.....They have it with a delicious local twist. The price of your meal relative to the value received is eye popping low.
