Although we were tired from a day of travel we wanted to try some local cuisine and didn’t want to walk long looking for a restaurant. What a delight it was to find Morgana just down the street from where were staying. From the moment we walked in the staff was welcoming and was able to seat us in spite of not having a reservation. The food was an amazing culinary invention of Asian and Galatian cuisine. My husband had a Spanish omelette, that was cooked to perfection with a moist centre with layers of flavour. I had the grilled octopus covered with Galatian cheese on a bed of kimchi infused potatoes. Every mouthful was an explosion of flavour. Both meals were paired with the perfect selection of wines recommended by our servers the meal ended with a melt in your mouth cheese cake We enjoyed ourselves so much that we intend to have another meal at Morgana’s before we leave this beautiful city.",2019-10-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12316948-Reviews-or10-Restaurante_Morgana-Madrid.html,UID_971,0.037,0.821,0.142,0.9703,0.2196296296296296,0.4098148148148148,0.539025,986,94,0.0953346855983772,0,10,False,32,0.1212121212121212,0.1515151515151515,0.1818181818181818,0.1212121212121212,0.1515151515151515,0.0303030303030303,0.0606060606060606,0.0303030303030303,0.1212121212121212,0.0303030303030303,180,124,4.483333333333333,0,0,husband first night madrid third week travel although tire day travel want tri local cuisin want walk long look restaur delight find morgana street stay moment walk staff welcom abl seat us spite reserv food amaz culinari invent asian galatian cuisin husband spanish omelett cook perfect moist centr layer flavour grill octopu cover galatian chees bed kimchi infus potato everi mouth explos flavour meal pair perfect select wine recommend server meal end melt mouth chees cake enjoy much intend anoth meal morgana leav beauti citi,good review,4

Once we got inside however, we were greeted with two kisses from the owner. She was so excited for us to be there. We both have never felt so comfortable in a resturant.  The wine was perfect. For an appetizer we shared the asparagus wrapped in pastry. For the main course we had pork loin with carmalized onions and pasta with mushrooms and bacon. For dessert we had the apples with cream. Everything was so delicious, and the more we ate the happier the owner was. It could not have been more adorable.  Her sister is the chef, and makes sure to come out, not only to say hi and check on the food, but to learn about you. Once again, we never felt so comfortable in a resturant.

But that didn't stop us getting a taxi here for our long awaited meal.... First of all from the outside it looks a very modern, chic place but on entering you feel like you have entered the home of these two delightful ladies... You are essentially in their front room! Charming, pretty, quaint, are words I would describe. We ordered a bottle of the house Rioja, and were told to wait precisely two minutes before tasting it! We obeyed and it was delicious... House croquettes, slow cooked oxtail, pork fillet, then a wonderful toffee apple dessert... Every bit as good as the last. Being asked all the time if we liked and not having to nod politely saying we did, because we really did enjoy every mouthful. Meeting the chef at the end of the evening and thanking her for all the wonderful food was a pleasure... Also being taken to the loo because of my bad foot by both the sisters at different parts of the evening was really above and beyond...

One of the most important aspects of a weekend or holiday for us is the restaurants, good food, ambience, efficient and friendly staff and not costing an arm and a leg.  We booked three restaurants from Trip advisor for the three nights we were in Madrid. The best with out a doubt was Algarabia. The restaurant had a delightful ambiance, the food was excellent (my wife had a fantastic pork dish and I had rabbit in a Bolognese sauce … very tasty). But the most endearing aspect of the restaurant was the sisters Pilar and Isabel, who were the owners, cook and waitress. After our meal we spent some time talking and joking with them it was a delightful evening.

We had fresh pasta with mushrooms and bacon and pork tenderloin with caramelized onions, and croquetas with red shrimp - all recommended.

Apparently folks prefer to dine on terraces during this time of the year. Lucky for us because we didn't need a reservation. This restaurant is owned by two sisters who are just absolutely, wonderful women. They made us feel so welcomed (which is hard to come by in Madrid)! One sister runs the front while the other sister is the chef. I'm so glad we had the opportunity to experience this wonderful restaurant. The sister running the front was very helpful when it came down to ordering and helping us navigate through the menu. The menu isn't overwhelming at all. I would like to think that if I opened a quaint restaurant someday, that it would be something like this. You can tell that the dishes are tailored to what the Sister Chef feels is best for the season. They have a friend at a winery who makes a blend just for them, so therefore, the ""house"" wine is excellent, worthy of a store shelf. Another friend bakes the bread. The Sister in the Front checked on us several times to chat with us and make sure we were ok, but totally in a non-obtrusive way. It was the perfect balance of attentiveness and privacy. Once we were finished, the Sister Chef came to our table to get our opinions on everything. I really enjoyed the whole experience so much. It will definitely be a dining experience to remember. I loved seeing the two sisters interact. It made me wonder how my mom and one of her six sisters would be if they had a restaurant! These two ladies made us feel as though we were visiting one of our Aunts who prepared a wonderful welcome home meal for us. They even took the time to bring us a booklet showing us what was available in the area to view, culturally. We really appreciated that and hope to check the events out. They genuinely cared about the rest of our trip. Back to the food....The pork was perfectly cooked, moist, and full of flavor. The ox tails were tender and rich. Also, our appetizer was delicious, as well as the small appetizer that was complements of the house. Overall, the food and ambiance can't be beat for this price point. I highly suggest dining here. You cannot get a personal touch along with 5 star food at many places in the world.

Isabel and Pilar, the two sisters who own the restaurant, are the most charming ladies you will ever meet. They welcomed us into their restaurant like family, which is actually more like eating in your family dining room, and explained all of the cuisine in hilarious detail. The food was extraordinary and we ended the meal by having all of the ladies take a group picture as a remembrance. We also were escorted down the street to make sure we found our way home.

We didn’t have reservations, but tried our luck anyway and showed up right when it opened at 1:30. They were booked solid for the next 4 days, but the waiter must have seen the desperate look on my face, so he took pity and “squeezed” us in…. Mindful of the accommodation, we at least tried to promise we’d be quick and would be in and out before the table was spoken for at 3PM… The waiter quickly corrected our way of thinking immediately and told us to just relax and enjoy the food. (We literally spent all afternoon here, following orders)  I’m a fairly well traveled foody, very much guided by my stomach, and generally spare no expense whatsoever on food and wine. It’s a priority. This accidental lunch we had ranks among the best meals I’ve ever had, ever.  The food wasn’t covered up in mystery cream sauces and/or bacon infused foam--we ordered mostly vegetables. It was simple, unpretentious, and just perfect. Our starter was a hot tomato soup—hearty and really vibrant. Next: artichokes, Leeks, Pulpo and then Steak Tartare. We had a cheese cake and sorbet respectively for dessert. Each dish was paired with a really gorgeous glass of sherry, wine or port (with dessert). I highly recommend turning over discretion on both the food and wine pairings to the wait staff—they did an amazing job.  Our two favorite dishes were the leeks and the artichoke hearts. I’ve never met an artichoke I didn’t like, but these were just perfect and unlike anything I’ve ever tried before in California—tender and lightly seasoned with a simple sauce and some sort of season salt/bullion. The leeks were ridiculous—again, not fussed with much, but just lightly seasoned and perfectly cooked. The same theme was present in the lemon basil sorbet –neither overly acidic or sweet—just darn good.  The service at this tiny little restaurant was impeccable. Like all the other tourists everywhere else, we were probably underdressed, but the atmosphere is casual and there’s not a lick of pretentiousness to the place at all. This place is just great! I highly recommend it. It’s a 7 out of 5 really.",2016-05-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or190-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_1015,0.023,0.765,0.212,0.9983,0.2462851731601731,0.4759090909090908,0.4357181818181818,2203,159,0.0721743077621425,1,51,False,70,0.1235955056179775,0.1573033707865168,0.3033707865168539,0.0674157303370786,0.2022471910112359,0.0112359550561797,0.0337078651685393,0.0112359550561797,0.0786516853932584,0.0112359550561797,376,248,4.851063829787234,0,0,happen across restaur base recommend devour tapa tour guid person rec reserv tri luck anyway show right open book solid next day waiter must seen desper look face took piti squeez us mind accommod least tri promis quick would tabl spoken pm waiter quickli correct way think immedi told us relax enjoy food liter spent afternoon follow order fairli well travel foodi much guid stomach gener spare expens whatsoev food wine prioriti accident lunch rank among best meal ever ever food cover mysteri cream sauc bacon infus foam order mostli veget simpl unpretenti perfect starter hot tomato soup hearti realli vibrant next artichok leek pulpo steak tartar chees cake sorbet respect dessert dish pair realli gorgeou glass sherri wine port dessert highli recommend turn discret food wine pair wait staff amaz job two favorit dish leek artichok heart never met artichok like perfect unlik anyth ever tri california tender lightli season simpl sauc sort season salt bullion leek ridicul fuss much lightli season perfectli cook theme present lemon basil sorbet neither overli acid sweet darn good servic tini littl restaur impecc like tourist everywher els probabl underdress atmospher casual lick pretenti place place great highli recommend realli,very good review,5

As always, we were blown away by the charm, friendliness and quality of the food. This was my 3rd time there in the last two years and it was just as good as always (in fact I was pleased to see that half the restaurant was taken by locals and not tourists.) The menu is not extensive but everything is prepared with care. There are half portions available for many of the dishes so between the two of us we could try four different things. Everything is nicely seasoned, even the half portions are not small. They have a very nice wine selection and the prices are great. Not only that, they are amazingly helpful on the wine, going so far as to steer us to a less expensive bottle that they felt would go better with the meal as well as letting us know that if we didn't like it, they would take it back as they could simply offer it by the glass then. The waiter went so far as to say that they had 25 wines by the glass and they didn't mind having 26. No need to return it though. My colleague who lives in Madrid had recalled several wines that we had the previous time that she was unable to find in any store and she asked the waiter about it an he was extraordinarily helpful in letting us know exactly where to go and what to ask for. The interior is very cozy with no more than 10ish tables. Tables are spaced nicely so you don't feel like you are sitting on top of each other. Décor is attractive. The best thing is the value - we had aperitifs, a bottle of good wine, four half portions, dessert wine and coffee and spent only 77 Euros for the two of us! I've eaten in many Michelin starred restaurants around the world where the cost is easily 5x or more and although they may be more delicate or complex, this place never ceases to amaze me for the overall quality, friendliness and value.",2016-05-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or190-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_605,0.035,0.78,0.186,0.9964,0.1709027777777777,0.5009589947089946,0.380075,1908,185,0.0969601677148846,1,35,False,95,0.1296296296296296,0.1666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.074074074074074,0.2037037037037037,0.0,0.0185185185185185,0.0,0.0555555555555555,0.0185185185185185,368,212,4.1875,0,0,madrid made sure go back vinoteca moratin invit colleagu join alway blown away charm friendli qualiti food rd time last two year good alway fact pleas see half restaur taken local tourist menu extens everyth prepar care half portion avail mani dish two us could tri four differ thing everyth nice season even half portion small nice wine select price great amazingli help wine go far steer us less expens bottl felt would go better meal well let us know like would take back could simpli offer glass waiter went far say wine glass mind need return though colleagu live madrid recal sever wine previou time unabl find store ask waiter extraordinarili help let us know exactli go ask interior cozi ish tabl tabl space nice feel like sit top cor attract best thing valu aperitif bottl good wine four half portion dessert wine coffe spent euro two us eaten mani michelin star restaur around world cost easili x although may delic complex place never ceas amaz overal qualiti friendli valu,good review,4

The charm of this restaurant is derived from the two sisters who run it. Isabel takes your orders and makes suggestions, and Pilar is the cook. Isabel also likes to talk about where you are from and travel information. That enhances the evening. We first had ensalada de pulpo (octopus salad) which was delicious. We then shared the rabo de toro (bull tail) which was very tasty. Finally we shared the Chumarro which is a grilled portion of Iberian pig. That was also tasty. We had the house Rioja with dinner. It was very good. The wine list is hand written on little cards which are glued into an old notebook. A certain charm to that as well. At the end of the evening, since we were unfamiliar with the neighborhood, Isabel was quite kind and walked us two blocks to where taxis were waiting.

This small charming restaurant is run by two delightful ladies from Rioja. Isabel looks after the diners while her sister Pilar cooks. Each guest is treated like a member of the family.   Among the highlights was the wonderful slow-cooked oxtail. Take Isabel’s advice and treat this as finger food: pick the bone up to make the most of the meat. Other memorable dishes included a pork solomillo with soft slow-cooked caramelised onions (the onions are cooked for 2 hours, Pilar tells us) and an octopus salad. We tried the house red wine on our first night and the house white on the second; both were excellent. If you are looking for laminated tourist menus with photographs, or fast food, this isn’t the place for you. If, on the other hand, you prefer delicious Riojan cuisine with the warmest welcome in Madrid, you will love the Algarabia. Thank you, ladies, for your tremendous food and for your warm hospitality.

I was excited to meet a friend whose blog I have been following for a few years. She invited us to see the Realistas en Madrid exhibit at the Thyssen museum so we met there. Afterwards she gave us a tour of the Las Letras barrio and then we came here for our 2:00 reservation, my friend's recommendation. First off, you must have a reservation. The restaurant is small and very popular so you’ll be disappointed if you arrive without a reservation. The food, service and ambiance were most excellent!! We started with the artichokes and leeks appetizers, both quite delicious. I’m not a big artichoke fan, but these were just wonderful! My friend recommended the chicken and mentioned that the recipe was from the owner’s grandmother. It was accompanied by potatoes and was exquisite! Juicy and very tasty.

The staff were very helpful with recommending the wine as were were not familiar with Spanish wine. We had croquettes to start with and they were melt in your mouth delicious. I had the oxtail stew which was very tender with beautiful flavours and my partner had the grilled sole. The fish was a whole fish and presented whole before the bones removed. It was done with such precision and skill that when presented on the plate it look great. The fish was very well cooked and my partner throughly enjoyed it.

It was tough to find though I luckily came across it. The food was great and the sisters (Isabel & Pillar) who own the restaurant (one is the hostess; the other is the chef) are so friendly that you are treated like family. It was like dining at home, as the atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing. Even after the meal, Pillar came out and asked us how everything was and chatted with a bunch of us after our meal. You can't ask for better service. The food was magnificent and well prepared! I ordered the cod because I love seafood, and also had some very good Vermouth suggested by the Isabel.

But from the minute we walked into this small vinoteca we were looked after in a completely open and down the earth way. The waiter, who was probably also part time owner and/or chef, took the time to apologize for his bad english before describing the entire menu in fast and fluent english... he claims he can only speak English about his menus :) He also helped us to order just the right amount of food, halving some of the portions where necessary so that we could explore more dishes.  It's not really Tapas, but you can approach it like that, which is what we did. The menu is short though, so perhaps not a great place for fussy eaters. As all the other reviews say, the potatoes (not ordered, almost an amuse bouche), the artichokes, and the leeks are all amazing. Simply cooked through a sous vide style (from what we could understand), but well prepared and served with amazing seasoning, from complex and rich sauces, smokey paprika, to a little crunch of sea salt. The beef tartare was fantastic, and served with a very spicy Peruvian hot sauce which we could add to taste. The veal cheek cannelloni was also rich yet delicate with a kind of fluffy béchamel on top. They also helped us match a couple of nice local whites wines. All the staff were pros, with fresh dishes and cutlery between dishes, fresh glasses for each wine, and all able to answer questions about the food. But my biggest surprise was the bill at the end of the night. Only 55 euros total for two people including five *fantastic* dishes (between us) and a couple of glasses of palatable wine each. Wow!

I will be in Madrid another 3 days and I will probably go again. The first time I went with a friend and we let the waiter choose what we had and everything was very tasty and flavorful.

Two days later I went with another friend and I tried a couple new things along with some repeated dishes.... I can’t wait to go here again. I highly recommend this restaurant. The waiters here are so nice and spend a lot of time explaining the dishes. ,2018-07-22,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12316948-Reviews-or90-Restaurante_Morgana-Madrid.html,UID_1047,0.011,0.824,0.165,0.9725,0.2208815426997245,0.5378879706152433,0.441525,611,58,0.0949263502454991,0,12,False,35,0.1666666666666666,0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.1666666666666666,0.0555555555555555,0.0555555555555555,0.0555555555555555,0.1111111111111111,0.0555555555555555,120,80,4.091666666666667,0,0,love restaur much came twice day madrid anoth day probabl go first time went friend let waiter choos everyth tasti flavor four cours plu desert sure ate typic dish amaz two day later went anoth friend tri coupl new thing along repeat dish wait go highli recommend restaur waiter nice spend lot time explain dish,very good review,5

It was our last night in Madrid and were lucky that there was one table available. It's a small cozy restaurant but there is enough space between tables to make it comfortable for a romantic dinner. Marcos explained every dish in detail. They gave us potatoes with paprika as a starter. Then we ordered the soup of the day which was a fresh tomatoes soup (without cream), you can taste the freshness of the tomatoes and ingredients. Then we had the leek confit with romesco sauce and the artichokes with salt. Amazing flavors! For the main course we shared the veal cheek cannelloni.

This restaurant only allows 20 covers, this certainly makes it feel like a special and intimate experience. We arrived for a 9.30 pm booking and rang the bell (the door hadn't been opened yet) immediately we were greeted by the owner (one of two sisters) She was helpful and friendly and made us recommendations and translated things when we didn't understand. The food is not typically Madrid in style but from the Rioja region where both of the sisters are from. The food is home cooked and delicious. We didn't have room for pudding but I can say the starters and main meals were really, really tasty. The price is in the higher side of mid priced (we paid 100 euros for 2 drinks, 1 bottle of very good Rioja wine, 2 starters and 2 main meals) but I feel that you get what you pay for and more here so fir me that's good value for money.

As the other reviews indicate, one must make reservations, the sooner the better. Fortunately for me, my hostal was also on Moratin Street. I was able to secure a lunch reservation for the earliest seating: 2:30 p.m.  To dine at Vinoteca is a culinary experience. I used “culinary” rather than “gustatory” because the meal is as much an exploration of the process as of the enjoyment. The owner/chef is Marcos. He wore Nikes and a beard and mustache peppered with gray. Marco is proud of his restaurant and eager to share with his customers each intimate detail of preparation and presentation. A diner should be ready to accept his enthusiasm and join in the culinary discussion. Otherwise, one should seek a restaurant where the chef is mostly behind the scenes.  Marcos explained each dish starting with a complimentary amuse-guele of potatoes and paprika, quite simple quite tasty, along with a flute of Cygnus champagne. Then an artichoke dish cooked long and lowly slowly, served with sea salt and olive oil. Excellent. Next came a soft octopus entrée with a glass of La Fou tinto (I did not note the year.) Very good combination. There was another course which I failed to note, but I recall enjoying everything immensely, including the fragrance of the main course, hot fresh mushrooms over pureed potatoes. I wafted the fragrance into my nose. The mushroom dish tasted great. Unfortunately, half way through this mushroom dish I began to feel a little queasy. I doubt that the dish was anything but perfect because it tasted delicious. I probably was still experiencing jet lag.  With dessert and a glass (perhaps two, I don’t recall) of the tinto, my bill was only 34 euro including tip. Thirty-four euro for a meal in one of the top ten (TripAdvisor) restaurants in Madrid. What a bargain ! (Of course, I had to leave something extra, hoping that this offer would not offend the waiter who did his job extremely well.) The outside and inside of the Vinoteca Moratin are unprepossessing. There is no napery, except napkins. The tables and seats are bare wood, minimalist. The emphasis here is on the food and service. Make your reservations soon.",2017-03-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or130-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_1065,0.038,0.816,0.146,0.9912,0.2082751937984496,0.4807087486157254,0.492348275862069,2291,174,0.0759493670886076,1,62,False,71,0.1477272727272727,0.125,0.3181818181818182,0.0568181818181818,0.1704545454545454,0.0227272727272727,0.0454545454545454,0.0113636363636363,0.0568181818181818,0.0454545454545454,394,250,4.809644670050761,0,0,lucki go vinoteca moratin day arriv would tabl one avail next day lunch review indic one must make reserv sooner better fortun hostal also moratin street abl secur lunch reserv earliest seat p dine vinoteca culinari experi use culinari rather gustatori meal much explor process enjoy owner chef marco wore nike beard mustach pepper gray marco proud restaur eager share custom intim detail prepar present diner readi accept enthusiasm join culinari discuss otherwis one seek restaur chef mostli behind scene marco explain dish start complimentari amus guel potato paprika quit simpl quit tasti along flute cygnu champagn artichok dish cook long lowli slowli serv sea salt oliv oil excel next came soft octopu entr e glass la fou tinto note year good combin anoth cours fail note recal enjoy everyth immens includ fragranc main cours hot fresh mushroom pure potato waft fragranc nose mushroom dish tast great unfortun half way mushroom dish began feel littl queasi doubt dish anyth perfect tast delici probabl still experienc jet lag dessert glass perhap two recal tinto bill euro includ tip thirti four euro meal one top ten tripadvisor restaur madrid bargain cours leav someth extra hope offer would offend waiter job extrem well outsid insid vinoteca moratin unprepossess naperi except napkin tabl seat bare wood minimalist emphasi food servic make reserv soon,good review,4

I was not disappointed! I was staying nearby at the Hotel Opera (see my seperate review) but having been to Madrid several times previously and experienced both good and bad, cheap and overpriced, meals in the Spanish capital wanted to look for something special for my wife's and my brother's first visit and in particular something memorable. The restaurant is located just of the Plaza Isobel II in a side street (Calle Union) opposite the south side of the Teatro Real. It looks nothing special from the outside (especially during the day when it mostly has its shutters down but does have a large hanging plant growing outside which makes it easy to spot, I went one night to have a look (as it doesn't open until 9 p.m.) and found it closed so had to wander around another day, saw the shutters half opened and rang on the doorbell. The restuarant is run by two sisters Isabel and Pilar. The very charming Isabel answered, explained that a booking was required as the restaurant only had seats for 20 people. Booked there and then and nervously we turned up as a group of 4 slightly early (8.50 p.m.). Isabel asked us to wait outside as the tables weren't quite ready but let us in a few minutes later. Wow! I can only describe the restaurant as being a bit like visiting someone's house (say your favourite aunty) who has laid out a few tables for a private dinner party with a few select guests. Isabel then swung into action providing an English language menu and between her pretty good English and my broken Spanish we started to have a conversation just as if we were at our favourite Aunty's house making small talk and discussing our travels etc etc. Brilliant fun and so welcoming. The menu is not huge but lots of interesting things (with specialities from the Rioja region of Spain from whence the sisters come) which are prepared in the kitchen by Isabel's sister Pilar. Little nibbles were provided to keep us going and we chose the house red which Isobel proudly showed bore the name of her (and her sister's) restuarant on the label. As is only right for two sisters from Rioja it was an exellent Rioja wine! Isabel was happy to let us order starters (and later puddings) to share which was just as well as the mains were very filling indeed and absolutely delicious! Pilar the chef came out afterwards and spoke to all the customers about their meals and like her sister was very chatty and welcoming. In summary, not the cheapest but very good value for money, food was superbly cooked and delicious but without doubt, for me, the absolute best thing about this restaurant is the feeling of exclusivity, being part of such a small group, the undivided individual attention shown by both Isabel and Pilar to their customers and the amazing homely surroundings. As I said previously, it was like being invited to a family dinner with the best food and the best wine and, (this is for you Isabel and Pilar), the best company.",2016-11-06,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991733-Reviews-or140-Restaurante_Algarabia-Madrid.html,UID_1067,0.032,0.76,0.207,0.9991,0.230154172029172,0.4769283569283568,0.3852631578947368,3100,259,0.0835483870967741,4,69,False,100,0.1031746031746031,0.1428571428571428,0.2539682539682539,0.0476190476190476,0.1507936507936507,0.0555555555555555,0.0396825396825396,0.0396825396825396,0.1111111111111111,0.0555555555555555,551,308,4.627949183303086,0,0,read review tripadvisor look someth differ even meal madrid wife brother sister law disappoint stay nearbi hotel opera see seper review madrid sever time previous experienc good bad cheap overpr meal spanish capit want look someth special wife brother first visit particular someth memor restaur locat plaza isobel ii side street call union opposit south side teatro real look noth special outsid especi day mostli shutter larg hang plant grow outsid make easi spot went one night look open p found close wander around anoth day saw shutter half open rang doorbel restuar run two sister isabel pilar charm isabel answer explain book requir restaur seat peopl book nervous turn group slightli earli p isabel ask us wait outsid tabl quit readi let us minut later wow describ restaur bit like visit someon hous say favourit aunti laid tabl privat dinner parti select guest isabel swung action provid english languag menu pretti good english broken spanish start convers favourit aunti hous make small talk discuss travel etc etc brilliant fun welcom menu huge lot interest thing special rioja region spain whenc sister come prepar kitchen isabel sister pilar littl nibbl provid keep us go chose hous red isobel proudli show bore name sister restuar label right two sister rioja exel rioja wine isabel happi let us order starter later pud share well main fill inde absolut delici pilar chef came afterward spoke custom meal like sister chatti welcom summari cheapest good valu money food superbl cook delici without doubt absolut best thing restaur feel exclus part small group undivid individu attent shown isabel pilar custom amaz home surround said previous like invit famili dinner best food best wine isabel pilar best compani,very good review,5

I was travelling along on business, and went there based on the TripAdvisor reviews. The decor, seating/table arrangements and atmosphere were perfect for what I wanted: a nice place to have dinner and a glass of wine while reading my book. The service was great: prompt, knowledgeable and very warm and friendly from all three people I dealt with. The food was good, but I did feel a tad disappointed having expected perhaps too much after reading the reviews. While tasty it was fairly basic (I had a half-portion of polpo on mashed potatoes followed by the veal cannelloni and a Creme brûlée-style desert). All the food was tasty but lacked a spark of elegance or inspiration. I'd say a good 3 or low 4 out of five - not average in a bad way, just solidly decent but not more. I was offered two tasters of wine by the glass, which was a nice touch. One was a fairly boring mainstream number from a mainstream producer, the other a more interesting Tempranillo from Rivera del Duero. Very good for the price (€4) but nothing special. I suspect the ones not offered by the glass but only whole bottles will be the better ones, which is fine and to be expected. All of in all, perfectly good and I'd go back, but with expectations adjusted. It certainly was not my best meal in Madrid but it fit the bill for what I wanted. While my earlier lunch at Luzi Bombon (goat's leg and truffled potato puree) was very good indeed and better for the food alone, I would not have wanted to go there for dinner on my own with a book. For that Moratin Vinoteca was a very good choice.",2017-01-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or130-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_1080,0.066,0.726,0.208,0.9941,0.3049937343358396,0.5841102756892231,0.4970066666666666,1614,151,0.0935563816604708,0,42,False,59,0.1318681318681318,0.1538461538461538,0.2857142857142857,0.0659340659340659,0.1648351648351648,0.0329670329670329,0.0329670329670329,0.0329670329670329,0.0549450549450549,0.0439560439560439,300,179,4.383333333333334,0,0,suppos headlin sum travel along busi went base tripadvisor review decor seat tabl arrang atmospher perfect want nice place dinner glass wine read book servic great prompt knowledg warm friendli three peopl dealt food good feel tad disappoint expect perhap much read review tasti fairli basic half portion polpo mash potato follow veal cannelloni creme br l e style desert food tasti lack spark eleg inspir say good low five averag bad way solidli decent offer two taster wine glass nice touch one fairli bore mainstream number mainstream produc interest tempranillo rivera del duero good price noth special suspect one offer glass whole bottl better one fine expect perfectli good go back expect adjust certainli best meal madrid fit bill want earlier lunch luzi bombon goat leg truffl potato pure good inde better food alon would want go dinner book moratin vinoteca good choic,average review,3

A small but perfectly sweet little restaurant in the Chueca district (right near our accommodation), we were met by two extremely welcoming and polite waiters/owners. Our Spanish is limited but we were introduced to the menu in superb English and given the best introduction to the Galician-fusion menu/wine list.  The croquetas were excellent (so crisp, excellent flavour and filling) and the tomatoes/avocado were a delight. So unique and very much haute cuisine - but reasonably priced.  Main courses - moules in a sort of spicy Thai or laksa-inspured broth for myself (I don't eat red meat) so it was lovely to see options of fish/vegetarian on a Spanish menu. My partner had the special of the rump steak, with padron peppers and potato chips.  To finish we had a breaded pudding with sweet sauce and apple flavours..

The restaurant was nearly full when we arrived and was completely full by 15:00h (tip - I think a reservation is a must).

The menu was explained in detail as to how each main dish was prepared. This made our choices easier and we were not disappointed at all. The dishes we selected were superb, I had sweet tomato soup followed by fresh marinated Norwegian salmon served with lightly pickled vegetables. For desert I had French apple pie which was excellent.

The interior is quite big, the ambience and the whole vibe of the restaurant was great and the service was knowledgeable and attentive. We wanted to try the argentinian meat, so we had the Strip Steak (Lomo Bajo) and the Beef tenderloin (Solomillo), both medium rare. Both of them were great, really tender meat, high quality and they were cooked to perfection. They have a large selection of wines to choose from, and many of them are also available by the glass, which is convenient. Normal prices for a quality steakhouse (around 30 euros per person without wine), definitely one of the best Argentinian restaurants in Madrid! I will be back whenever I visit beautiful Madrid!",2020-04-09,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d796535-Reviews-La_Cabana_Argentina-Madrid.html,UID_1102,0.016,0.76,0.225,0.9937,0.424484126984127,0.5684126984126985,0.466375,1005,89,0.0885572139303482,2,26,False,56,0.0909090909090909,0.2121212121212121,0.4242424242424242,0.0606060606060606,0.1515151515151515,0.0,0.0303030303030303,0.0,0.0303030303030303,0.0,180,122,4.583333333333333,0,0,decid visit place great review great choic delici meat ever tast meat steak lover like definit love place visit busi friday night lucki enough seat immedi interior quit big ambienc whole vibe restaur great servic knowledg attent want tri argentinian meat strip steak lomo bajo beef tenderloin solomillo medium rare great realli tender meat high qualiti cook perfect larg select wine choos mani also avail glass conveni normal price qualiti steakhous around euro per person without wine definit one best argentinian restaur madrid back whenev visit beauti madrid,good review,4

Friendly and attentive staff, a little over eager to keep moving and need to relax. Good wine list with a wine selection of Argentine and national Spanish options, prices are okay. The meat is exceptional if you go for the Argentine option. Absolutely incredible! We visited two days consecutively it was so good. They do have trouble cooking to order though, the filet ordered “well done” had to be returned as it was rare when cut. What sort of chef cannot cook to order?  It is good but not great as a Restaurant, no music or atmosphere creation so you can hear everyone’s discussion around you. Limited social distancing between the people, the tables are too close together. No Baileys for the chuppito? What is going on? This is a worldwide drink and you do not have a bottle. We rated it around 8.5/10 on both days. At €164 for 3 with a good Malbec we thought it was okay value for money.

Don’t! It is quite small but well worth either booking or arriving at the start of their sessions. The food is Galician - based on the region in the north western part of Spain. All the staff are from this region so work well as a team and there is the added advantage that a couple of them have worked in the UK, so have an excellent working knowledge of English.  The waiters are very helpful and happy to explain the ‘compact’ menu. There are a total of 7 starters and 6 main courses, and although some may feel this is limited, perhaps ‘a few done well’ is better than ‘a lot done badly’? I loved the tuna pastry dish I started with and my wife was equally happy with the tomatoes stuffed with apple and avocado. The baked hake was excellent as a main course. Deserts, only 2 to choose from but again I loved the Spanish take on Tiramasu. All in all, reasonable price, great ambiance and helpful waiters....and of course, great tasting food.

I liked the tender meat and mild cheese in the taco. I'm not sure if it was roughly grounded corn chips, but they added another layer of flavor and extra crunchiness to the taco. I was worried that the kimchi might overpower the octopus dish, but it did not - rather, it added a slight kick to the potato, which in turn complemented the mild octopus flavor. Definitely worth trying for those looking for something new but do not want to wander too far off. Overall, I can say that this restaurant's attempt to meld different traditions resulted in INfusion, not CONfusion of flavors. P. S. This restaurant welcomes half orders so take advantage of it. Also, be patient because there might be some pauses between the dishes.",2018-05-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12316948-Reviews-or110-Restaurante_Morgana-Madrid.html,UID_1118,0.026,0.867,0.107,0.9426,0.1263347763347763,0.5044492544492544,0.3721777777777778,1150,87,0.0756521739130434,0,38,False,34,0.0975609756097561,0.1219512195121951,0.3414634146341463,0.024390243902439,0.1463414634146341,0.024390243902439,0.048780487804878,0.048780487804878,0.0975609756097561,0.048780487804878,203,143,4.669950738916256,0,0,come food wari word fusion also spell authent hedg bet order two fusion dish galician style taco pulpo kimchi mash potato one tradit dish tuna empanada iron three dish two fusion dish turn success although good think empanada would better slightli warm like tender meat mild chees taco sure roughli ground corn chip ad anoth layer flavor extra crunchi taco worri kimchi might overpow octopu dish rather ad slight kick potato turn complement mild octopu flavor definit worth tri look someth new want wander far overal say restaur attempt meld differ tradit result infus confus flavor p restaur welcom half order take advantag also patient might paus dish,good review,4

I’m normally not too generous with rating food. I’m a pretty good chef myself and if I cannot replicate a dish, to me that means I came across a special restaurant. Literally, I didn't had such good food in a long time. The taste was so delicately, fresh and pure. We had really good wine with it. They recommend to take one dish of each course, which we didn't because it was late, but I would definitely do so when I have the change to come back.

The experience was really stressfull and the waiters seemed really stressed as well. The Fork did not say anything about that the tasting menu is only served for dinner (and their webpage does not either). Furthermore there was a cold breeze through the restaurant coming form the ventilation above the door, we were moved to another table which was better. We had some snacks which tasted really good, and then some starters that were tasty but tasted somewhat the same, the mains were mixed: the duck was really good, the iberain pork ok and the beef cheeks too spicy. The water had a slight taste of chemical, so we are not sure it was bottled water (but filtered). The waiters were friendly but really stressed and we constantly felt rushed to finish and the food came really fast and we did not have time for coffee and dessert. If the purpose is to give guests a gourmet experience 2 hours is simply not enough, so they should write on the webpage that its more for people who want a quick dinner (and only 2 courses is possible in 2 hours if you should not feel rushed).

Loved the hummus(?) that came with the bread, was so tasty (subsequently found out that bread is chargeable at 2EUR). Would recommend the crispy wonton as starter. As a Singaporean, the chilli crab croquette didn't really taste like what we have back home (their version is creamier and less spicy), so I wouldn't recommend it. Had the black noodles - with seared squid and crispy onions - this could do with less salt, but is a fusion dish done well - gravy was good and not too spicy. Finished off with a yoghurt dessert with matcha meringue(?) and figs - great end to a meal and I actually don't really eat figs but I polished the bowl. Not exactly cheap but had an enjoyable meal.

Past experience suggested that they are very good and very inexpensive.  Angelita is a wine pairing delight. We were fortunate to be waited on by the sommelier - one of the brothers who run the joint.  We gave him some broad direction and he did the rest. We had a few plates to share, and importantly, a cheese selection. He brought wines to the table with a great presentation of origin etc. We got to taste before committing to half glasses. Only turned one down out of 5   Food was outstanding. Ratatouille is their signature dish, but I was delight by the grilled pork, which tasted like beef. Sesame desert also not to be missed.",2020-03-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10159455-Reviews-Angelita_Madrid-Madrid.html,UID_1149,0.007,0.821,0.171,0.9703,0.2526215277777777,0.5977951388888889,0.3483181818181818,795,75,0.0943396226415094,0,19,False,25,0.1212121212121212,0.1818181818181818,0.2727272727272727,0.0606060606060606,0.1212121212121212,0.0303030303030303,0.0303030303030303,0.0303030303030303,0.0909090909090909,0.0606060606060606,146,108,4.424657534246576,0,0,prefac look place wine tast madrid mani wonder wine spain hard imposs find us past experi suggest good inexpens angelita wine pair delight fortun wait sommeli one brother run joint gave broad direct rest plate share importantli chees select brought wine tabl great present origin etc got tast commit half glass turn one food outstand ratatouil signatur dish delight grill pork tast like beef sesam desert also miss,good review,4

I ate in the street level wine bar, not the basement American bar. I was most lucky to get a seat as the restaurant is generally booked full with reservations. I was asked if I would sit at the bar and said yes. I ended up at a small raised table above the main seating area and a few feet from the actual bar. It allowed good views of food, activity, and satisfied people. The menu is a simple one page list with the expectation that orders are for two to split. My delightful server said that there were entrees that could be ordered as half and I took his advice on selections. I had four small plates, dessert, and two glasses of wine. All was good. My first course was a single fresh oyster. Then a very tasty organic ratatouille with added texture, egg and rosemary mayonnaise. Different and delicious. Oxtail cannelloni with wild mushrooms brought another pleasing flavor. Then came the amazing charcoal Iberian pork with sweet potato and ""burned"" eggplant. The pork was tender and had a edge of crispness. The server said it is first grilled and then oven cooked. Dessert was porcini mushroom mousse with fruits and thyme crumble. It was a different taste and I expect that I will reserve judgment until I try it again. There was no rush, I was asked about my enjoyment level, and was treated with true concern.

Our waiter engaged with us and made us feel very welcome, We all had the filet steak, these are mouth watering and were cooked to perfection. We added a salad and fried between four and there was plenty to go around.  Here you get great food in a lovely setting with attentive staff at a very reasonable price.

THe taxi had to drop us off at the top of the street as he could not get down to it. We did not book as it was a Monday night but it was not busy at the time of our arrival. However after 9,30pm it filled up so if you want to eat late it would be best to book. We had two steaks one fillet and one plank both of which where cooked to perfection (pink) along with two baked potatoes and their house veg which had alot of oive oil on it. It is Spain after all. The steaks required no seasoning whatsoever and melted in your mouth. No desserts. No coffees This is a good well run Argentinian Steak House and you get what it says in its name.

The conceited females never smile, do not recommend anything or do anything that is essential for good service. They walk around with a grumpy face- they lack hospitality and passion for what they are doing. I'm a waiter myself, therefore I know that the essential goal is to make the customers happy and if they leave the restaurant they should be satisfied. What we received was far from solid service performance. But at the paying process they do await tip, which is simply ridiculous! We gave the tip the chef, bevause the kitchen performed excellent! The steaks were perfectly grilled and the fries with garlic and parsley are a must-try at this restaurant. It is a real shame that the service- staff performes so poor reagrding the excellent food the kitchen crew prepares. But the waiters do have more customer- contact and if the service is as bad as it was at our dinner, the whole restaurant suffers.

I was looking for a Restaurant fairly close to my hotel that I could walk to and not need to worry about how much wine I consumed. Grin. It's easily located with Google Maps, well reviewed and bookings are simply made using the Google function. You can also just dial its number manually the old fashioned way. Unless you propose turning up at 11:15pm and hope to get a walk in table, I suggest you do make a booking as it is very busy. If you show up at a more normal 9pm without booking I suspect you will be disappointed. The person who answered the phone when I booked spoke perfect English. As the name of the Restaurant suggests, they are justifiably proud of their Argentine steak and accordingly this is what I ordered and what I recommend.  They do however have local steaks, excellent fish, pork and chicken dishes, so I think that any discerning diner will find something to his or her taste here. I hesitate to say that this is the best steak I have ever tasted. I can't recall however, a particular occasion when I have had a markedly better one. I can say that it was here that I found the finest tasting tomato I have ever had, as part of a delicious side salad.  As it was just quartered and in a simple salad, you might argue that little praise can be given to the Chef. Rather I would point out his/her product sourcing and attention to detail. I live in the UK and travel widely in Europe. I have experienced no tomatoes available in the UK which remotely compare in flavour.  Nor have I found any in France or any other place.  A little thing I know, but the Devil is in the detail, No ? The wine selection is as you'd expect and has choices for all wallets. I chose a dessert of Flambeed Crepes, similar to my all time favourite of Crepe Suzette, (but not with Oranges), this was also delicious and memorable. I tasted the dishes my companion chose and paid close attention to the dishes chosen by my neighbouring diners.  Everything I tasted was of a very high standard and all of the other dishes that I viewed I would be happy to order on another occasion. The decor and ambiance of the place is lovely and also memorable. The staff, I found, were friendly and efficient. To summarise, the whole evenings dining experience was a delight.",2019-11-10,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d796535-Reviews-or20-La_Cabana_Argentina-Madrid.html,UID_1247,0.033,0.835,0.132,0.9917,0.3030332594235034,0.5725110336817654,0.357136,2328,223,0.0957903780068728,0,50,False,78,0.125,0.1826923076923076,0.2692307692307692,0.0673076923076923,0.2211538461538461,0.0192307692307692,0.0096153846153846,0.0288461538461538,0.048076923076923,0.0288461538461538,433,254,4.3672055427251735,0,0,great good fortun dinner day ago look restaur fairli close hotel could walk need worri much wine consum grin easili locat googl map well review book simpli made use googl function also dial number manual old fashion way unless propos turn pm hope get walk tabl suggest make book busi show normal pm without book suspect disappoint person answer phone book spoke perfect english name restaur suggest justifi proud argentin steak accordingli order recommend howev local steak excel fish pork chicken dish think discern diner find someth tast hesit say best steak ever tast recal howev particular occas markedli better one say found finest tast tomato ever part delici side salad quarter simpl salad might argu littl prais given chef rather would point product sourc attent detail live uk travel wide europ experienc tomato avail uk remot compar flavour found franc place littl thing know devil detail wine select expect choic wallet chose dessert flambe crepe similar time favourit crepe suzett orang also delici memor tast dish companion chose paid close attent dish chosen neighbour diner everyth tast high standard dish view would happi order anoth occas decor ambianc place love also memor staff found friendli effici summaris whole even dine experi delight,good review,4

Made our reservation quite late and were actually quite tired due to a late night the day before. The staff were very friendly, and it was a really nice atmosphere with people chatting with people at the neighboring tables.  Had a fantastic meal with tuna tataki, ceviche, steak tartar and iberica. Everything tasted as described by our waitress, and we were very happy during the whole evening. Four courses to share was more than enough, and the price were very affordable. We ended up paying 64 euro. I can recommend Kuoco360 for sure, and we are looking forward going there again next time we are in Madrid.  The mains in the Peruvian kitchen are quite heavy compared to the lighter, citric fish starters. The mains are basically a lot of meat, gravy and carbs. It is however good to keep in mind that the Peruvian kitchen actually is two different. I prefer the lighter kitchen with ceviche and fresh fish since gravy and meat is not my favorite.

From the first email, the communication was great - prompt, friendly and welcoming. On arrival, the same qualities were evident and we were quickly seated and drinks ordered. There was something both informal and highly organised about the staff, and we were soon relaxed and thinking what to order. Marcos makes the menu redundant ! He took us through each dish with such detailed and passionate descriptions that it was hard not to ask for one of everything. When we suggested three starters (a family of three, one being a teenager), Marcos said he thought that might be too much food and suggested half portions of two dishes, and he was right to do so. We had leeks that were so sweet, sicculent and tender, and artichokes that dissolved in the mouth. The 'full' dish was octopus in a smoky paprika sauce. All three were delicious. The choice of mains was as difficult to make, but we plumped for chicken, cannelone and steak tartare. All perfectly cooked (or devised in the case of the steak) and flavoured. The wine list was very good, but this was an easier choice for us since we are currently impressed with Ribera del Duero wines, and the one we chose was a step up from our usual bottle. Time passed ever so quickly. The service was very attentive (our glasses remained empty for seconds only!) and the ambience was warm and lively but not intrusive, especially for such a small venue. The bill ? A very reasonable sum for this level of quality in a capital city on a Friday evening.

I was one day ago with a very good friend in Madrid, hanging around in a totally not occupied time slot around the Museums (Prado/Thyssen-Bornemisza) quarter.l We searched for a nice Iberic wine place. And there's one, some friends mentioned to us. I'm going to be totally blunt: I suppose it's a nice place, it was wholeheartedly recommended to us. From the start I will admit that we had no prior reservation, and boy, did we learned a hard way lesson! We have very gently approached the staff around 8 PM and we have very decently accepted that all tables were booked and that the restaurant was not available for the evenings to come. We did understand, and we headed for a less in-the-bundle restaurant in the area. Heading back at around 11 PM in the evening, we passed along this place again. We really praised it, wanting a good evening to remember in this great city, a true European capital, Madrid!  We took a look inside and there were at least two tables where I and one remaining friend could be sitted in. With full fledged smiles we entered the place. It had more than an hour of opening hours, judging from its TripAdvisor advertising open hours. And this is where the spell was broken. Our evening in this ever-party city was ruined with a smile :). No, I'm not smiling! At a very early 11 PM, we were, frankly said, kicked out! Why? There's the funny part! Although there were admittedly free tables, at 11 PM, we were kicked out because, I quote: you haven't booked a table, and it would be unfair for the others to be accepted. We said: we did understand this earlier, at around 8 PM, when we walked away with no comments, as we had no reservations in place. But at 11 PM, with available places, why treat tourist so arrogantly? Why send us in such a discarding manner away? We even mentioned that there were no other opportunities in the near future and that we saw no reason in not being allowed to enjoy a relaxing night in the great Madrid, a city we so longed to visit. Our begging was so majestically ignored! Basically we were ""invited"" to walk away, regardless of our availability to order a full menu dinner (which was an excuse to be sent away, although the kitchen was long time closed!). I won't mention names, the employees have no doing in this humiliation. We were, according to ""restaurant policy"", invited to leave! We did mention complaining on TripAdvisor, and we received the most condescending smile you can image. Many things can be said about how we felt! But I will not have this review be driven by anger, as we have not chosen Madrid for this! We came here for the spirit of this great city! And we were grateful in seeing this all over the places we were so warmly invited in. Except this one. I've been in many places. Most of them not reviewed here.  But I have recently decided to share my experiences, so I will leave this here, for you to consider.",2016-11-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or140-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_1290,0.083,0.785,0.133,0.9834,0.2068238993710691,0.4933018867924529,0.4830142857142857,3043,278,0.091357213276372,11,105,False,89,0.1081081081081081,0.1171171171171171,0.2162162162162162,0.081081081081081,0.1171171171171171,0.054054054054054,0.054054054054054,0.036036036036036,0.1351351351351351,0.081081081081081,553,302,4.500904159132007,0,0,stori would rather tell realli bother place good credenti fail understand way one day ago good friend madrid hang around total occupi time slot around museum prado thyssen bornemisza quarter l search nice iber wine place one friend mention us go total blunt suppos nice place wholeheartedli recommend us start admit prior reserv boy learn hard way lesson gentli approach staff around pm decent accept tabl book restaur avail even come understand head less bundl restaur area head back around pm even pass along place realli prais want good even rememb great citi true european capit madrid took look insid least two tabl one remain friend could sit full fledg smile enter place hour open hour judg tripadvisor advertis open hour spell broken even ever parti citi ruin smile smile earli pm frankli said kick funni part although admittedli free tabl pm kick quot book tabl would unfair other accept said understand earlier around pm walk away comment reserv place pm avail place treat tourist arrogantli send us discard manner away even mention opportun near futur saw reason allow enjoy relax night great madrid citi long visit beg majest ignor basic invit walk away regardless avail order full menu dinner excus sent away although kitchen long time close mention name employe humili accord restaur polici invit leav mention complain tripadvisor receiv condescend smile imag mani thing said felt review driven anger chosen madrid came spirit great citi grate see place warmli invit except one mani place review recent decid share experi leav consid,bad review,2

All of our dishes - from starters through entre through dessert were each terrific in their own way. One thing I though was particularly great is that they mentioned the don't have multiple seatings so that nobody feels rushed - maybe that's more common in Madrid. Either way it's great to be able to take your time & linger and absorb the ambiance - which was nice, lively but not loud and a varied group of locals. We actually would have come back the next night (!) but sadly they didn't have any open tables. Nevertheless, the lovely owner gave us some recommendations nearby.

I had made a reservation by email from home and I was glad that we did. It is a small restaurant and was filled by the time we finished dinner (the restaurant was empty when we arrived for dinner at 8 PM — late for us, apparently early for Madrileños). One of the reviews I had read said that the chef discusses the menu with each patron, which he did with us, and he also agreed to help me select a bottle of wine - based, of course, on the entrees we selected. He chose a wine from a bodega in Madrid, Bodega Marañones, which was fabulous. One great thing about the restaurant is that almost every wine in the wine list was priced from 20 to 30 Euros. The chef said that he created the wine list with price in mind, to showcase the extremely high quality of moderately priced wines. Judging by the wine that he suggested for us, he has succeeded! He took the time to speak with us for several minutes. He is clearly proud of his work and his restaurant and, as we found out, has every reason to be. It was a great choice and, without a doubt, our best dining experience during our ten-day trip to Madrid and Seville.  The menu had a good selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and we had a tough time choosing among them. We started with a tomato salad, which consisted of a huge platter of simply delicious cut and peeled tomatoes, dressed only with olive oil and a little salt. This was a recommendation from the chef, who told us that the tomatoes were in season and probably would not be anywhere near as good in a week. They were fresh, juicy, and flavorful. We had a poached cod — incredibly good, not the salt cod that can be on offer in many Madrid restaurants. And two desserts, an apple tart and violet ice cream. The dishes were on the simpler side — our preference — but be assured that the chef was inventive and original without being flamboyant. The atmosphere was dark and subdued, a perfect place for a non-fussy romantic dinner.",2016-10-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d3669444-Reviews-or150-Moratin_Vinoteca_Bistrot-Madrid.html,UID_1304,0.01,0.861,0.129,0.9913,0.3341487455197132,0.6717204301075269,0.3452,2039,182,0.0892594409024031,1,48,False,78,0.1486486486486486,0.1621621621621621,0.3108108108108108,0.0945945945945946,0.1621621621621621,0.0,0.0,0.0135135135135135,0.054054054054054,0.054054054054054,381,213,4.351706036745407,0,0,wife wonder memor dinner morot n vinoteca bistrot made reserv email home glad small restaur fill time finish dinner restaur empti arriv dinner pm late us appar earli madril os one review read said chef discuss menu patron us also agre help select bottl wine base cours entre select chose wine bodega madrid bodega mara one fabul one great thing restaur almost everi wine wine list price euro chef said creat wine list price mind showcas extrem high qualiti moder price wine judg wine suggest us succeed took time speak us sever minut clearli proud work restaur found everi reason great choic without doubt best dine experi ten day trip madrid sevil menu good select appet entre dessert tough time choos among start tomato salad consist huge platter simpli delici cut peel tomato dress oliv oil littl salt recommend chef told us tomato season probabl would anywher near good week fresh juici flavor poach cod incred good salt cod offer mani madrid restaur two dessert appl tart violet ice cream dish simpler side prefer assur chef invent origin without flamboy atmospher dark subdu perfect place non fussi romant dinner,good review,4

We pre booked earlier in the day and on arrival were given a choice of available tables by the very self confident waitress that attended to us.  She then went on to explain the menu, discuss ‘degree’ of spiciness that we preferred. My preference was ‘not at all spicy’ and my wife chose ‘moderately’. All seemed OK, but when the starters arrived, my Ceviche Classico (tuna) was far too spicy for my enjoyment whilst my wife enjoyed her tataki (salmon). She then proceeded to finish my Ceviche which she said was more spicy than her starter! For the main course I had the chicken which a previous reviewer described as a ‘hoysin sauce’ and I am inclined to agree! My wife had the Sea bass and rice which she loved! My wife’s starter was whisked away from her as soon as she finished the last mouthful because her main course was ready and arrived at the table immediately. Hopefully the restaurant will look at their ‘timings’ as this made us feel rushed. Prices were reasonable and overall, the staff were very good. My wife would certainly rate this as a 5 stars but I would only give 3 so we’ve compromised and given a 4.",2018-05-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d11905394-Reviews-or40-Kuoco_360_food-Madrid.html,UID_1113,0.0,0.847,0.153,0.99,0.2304037267080745,0.5493374741200828,0.3421909090909091,1189,107,0.0899915895710681,3,20,False,43,0.1851851851851851,0.1111111111111111,0.3703703703703703,0.074074074074074,0.1481481481481481,0.0,0.037037037037037,0.037037037037037,0.037037037037037,0.0,216,142,4.50462962962963,0,0,chose restaur basi good trip advisor review pre book earlier day arriv given choic avail tabl self confid waitress attend us went explain menu discuss degre spici prefer prefer spici wife chose moder seem ok starter arriv cevich classico tuna far spici enjoy whilst wife enjoy tataki salmon proceed finish cevich said spici starter main cours chicken previou review describ hoysin sauc inclin agre wife sea bass rice love wife starter whisk away soon finish last mouth main cours readi arriv tabl immedi hope restaur look time made us feel rush price reason overal staff good wife would certainli rate star would give compromis given,good review,4

What can I say about this steak. I'm not a steak person, come from the UK, prefer chicken as steaks in the UK r like cardboard. However, this steak, madre mia! It melted in your mouth, was so tasty. It was however expensive: two steaks, fries and some salad to share, couple of beers cost 60 euros. Next day on the train to Toledo for the easter processions both of us had the same thought: that steak last night was so tasty wasn't it? A random thought by two people on a train about the steaks!!!

From the outside it doesn't really distinguish itself from many other bistros or small restaurants. BUT , this was highly recommended by the concierge staff at The Westin Palace Hotel and they were absolutely correct.  Inside, it is clearly a bistro in its appearance. Not fancy, just very pleasant. HOWEVER, the highlights are 1)the waitstaff who were some of the most pleasant people we have met and 2) the food. First, one can trust everything that the waitstaff tells you about each item as well as the wine. We had an outstanding tomato salad and a marinated salmon for appetizers. We both chose the same main course, the cannelloni with veal cheeks. The wine from Ribera Del Duerro region was Kairn (?spelling). Everything was OUTSTANDING. It was a welcome change from some of the more formal and more expensive restaurants. The price of the meal was extremely reasonable---about 60% less than some of the fancy restaurants.  Lastly, how good is it? It's the restaurant that concierge staff from The Westin goes to for their Christmas lunch every year.

The food was completely awesome. We started with a very simple tomato salad. But the flavours were SO intense. We couldn't decide between the cod and the chicken for the main course, so it was suggested it was split between two courses and two plates. The cod was cooked to perfection, as was the chicken.

We were so happy that they managed to accommodate us even though it was a busy Friday night. Not knowing what to expect, and the fit out of the small restaurant was casual, we were totally blown away by the creative and high quality gourmet food, at such reasonable prices. We enjoyed the crispy wontons, grilled octopus, the thai curry style fish and black noodles, mellow rice. The mellow rice has amazing rich flavour ( a truffle fan), but I think the saltiness can be dialled down a little. We are very impressed with the chef's talent. The service staff were friendly and helpful. We were surprised to find out that it has only been opened for about 6 months, already it is very popular as they had to turn away people at the door.

We had to wait a bit for the restaurant to open at 1:30pm, but it was very worth it. The pizzas are prepared by a friendly owner with a variety of fresh local ingredients. We tasted egg-plant, truffle, Spanish jamon and goat cheese with balsamic reduction containing pizzas. Absolutely spectac! Only thing missing was a glass or two of California Chardonnay or New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to round off the taste sensation. The restaurant is very tiny, with only a couple chairs, so taking pizza to go is also a great option. Prices extremely reasonable at 6eur for 2 generous pieces and a drink.

The pizzas all had a touch of innovation. We especially loved the teriyaki chicken and the mushroom pizzas. And the crust! The crust is special and divine! When we commented to the owner that his pizzas are among the best we ever tasted, he was totally modest and said his home town of Napoli has better ones (ok our next culinary destination).

After their kitchens´ greeting I had ”Green Beans Salad, Mango, Bacon and Cava Foam”, which was not only tasty but also visually great. As my main I had “Sierra de Guadarrama” Grilled Veal Loin, Muhammara and Padron Peppers”, which also was delicious. Also the vines selected for my courses suited very well together with them.

From the moment we walked in the door till we left everything was just about perfect. The owner was exceptionally friendly and talked us through the menu making really helpful suggestions. The food itself was simply superb and all the dishes we sampled were well cooked, beautifully presented and exceedingly good. Most dishes come as half or full portions and this was absolutely perfect for lunch. Lastly we all felt that given the quality of the food and the service the price was very reasonable.  I would advise booking in advance as the restaurant is fairly small and will become even more popular given the positive reviews it receives. The Market is not in the centre of Madrid but is easily reached by a short and very worthwhile metro trip.

We were not dissappointed, on the contrary, we were completely blown away. The service was excellent and the food was even better. The menu was very inventive and we took an adventure and ordered the most bizarre options that the restaurant offered - everything was spectacular: The starters were excellent and really opened our appetite. The main courses were perfectly cooked and seasoned and offered the perfect portion to leave room for dessert. Finally, the desserts were fabulous even though on the menu they seemed kind of odd, one of them had sweet basil pesto and a sweet cherry tomatoe. We were offered a Spanish red wine ""Iuvene"" that we afterwards searched in several stores - unfortunately we didn't find it, but it was great and highlighted the different tastes of the food.

The gals opted for two medio portions each while the men chose medio starters and full entrées. All choices were excellent. We decided this time to also have dessert.

They have to have better follow up on those of the ""Special occasions"" as Customer Service. But as for the product, service price, I thought it was right, as we ordered a bottle of wine, a salad to share (they are quite nice) a Burrata with Pomodorini very good, and Empanada Argentina, he ate the Solomillo and I chicken with a garnish of vegetables (enough for 2) and an Argentinian brownie ... oh and bread.

Our friends reserved there for a birthday dinner and I'm so glad they did!  The menu is short so very easy to navigate. Our waiter spoke flawless English and explained every dish. I had the brandade de bacalao, which won me over immediately: fluffy creamed cod piped into thick rounds of bread. One of my friends got the blood-sausage ravioli, which was an explosion of flavor. Then I had the pork cheeks with a mole sauce: the tenderest meat and fabulous spices. The prices are very affordable for a restaurant of this quality. The restaurant also offers half portions for appetizers as well as main courses. The wine list is very good and also affordable. For dessert, since it was my friend's birthday, the chef came out with something special: a basil poundcake with candied cherry tomatoes. Sounds weird, but it totally works!

I saw this restaurant receiving good reviews, but was not very sure if this place was suitable for a business dinner. In particular, the client we wanted to take to this restaurant was known as a gourmet. I went to the restaurant a few days before the dinner to confirm my booking and its location. I was not a guest on that date however, the owner was very politely serving me and explained the restaurant/menus. The restaurant was smaller than I thought but I had confidence that our client would be amazed. The dining was amazing. This was due to not only food but also hospitality. The owner was so friendly and dedicated to customers including us. This is because the restaurant accepts a small number of guests and the staff are closer to customers.

We were recommended to try just a 1/2 portion of the spiced fish starter ( which was good advice, as it was spicy )and to team it with their special of the seared tuna with black garlic aioli starter which was beautiful (see picture) and so were the main courses of roast shoulder of pork and black risotto with squid.

We had been walking quite a bit and were looking for a spot on our way back to the hotel. Searching Trip Advisor, I found a place that looked to fit the bill. Though we were starting to wonder a bit as we walked thru a pretty dicey part of Madrid and down a small alley that didn’t bode too well. [Oddly enough, this is ½ a block from Taste of the US, apparently the only place you can get Pop Tarts, Twinkies, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie filling.] We walked past it at first, then noticed the nice awning outclassed anything else on the street so we went in. The service was top notch, and the food was also – creative, different, fresh, wonderful.

Having made a reservation, we were nearly an hour late but when we called they were totally understanding and still had a table for us. The food is creative and really delicious. The starters are all available in two sizes meaning that even if there are only two of you can share and try a lot of the dishes. We also shared one of the main meals (gnochi and lamb ragu) which was amazing. The waiters/owner comes and explains each dish when they deliver it to your table which is a nice touch and are all really friendly. I would say they are Michelin star quality.

It's located in the old part of the city, near Sol, and it's one of the best steakhouses in town, in my humble opinion. This restaurant is specifically located in ""Ventura de la Vega"" street, which is known as ""the street of taste"" (La Calle del Sabor, http://www.callesabor.es). The exact address is ""Ventura de la Vega, 10"" in Madrid.  It's owned and managed by argentineans, and I can confirm that the meat is prepared in the argentinean style of the ""Parrilla"". Most of the different steak options are very good and i prefer the ""Bife Lomo Bajo"". One of the most interest things is that you can even taste some of the argentinean specialties like ""Molleja"" (Sweetbread), which is quite difficult to find in this kind of restaurants in Europe. The area is surrounded by other restaurants and pubs so you can go out after finishing dinner, if you are able to walk after eating a regular argentinean steak of more than 400 grams.  If you are planning to go to this restaurant on a weekend night, i recommend you make a reservation because it would be full otherwise.

I am always attracted to a restaurant with an open kitchen, there's something enticing about seeing your food and how it's prepared, the aromas as it cooks and the care a chef takes to produce a great meal.  This restaurant is situated around the corner from our hotel 'Suite Prado' and we chose this place to splash-out during our visit. Prime cuts cooked however you want them. I recommend medium, which is medium rare elsewhere. Pink in the middle and seared to lock in all of the flavours. Staff are inviting, not sure where the other reviewers got the idea that the waiting staff are rude, but I guess everyone can have an off day. The service style is quite traditional, different servers to tak the order, deliver and clear away. They tend to leave you alone and aren't over-friendly which might not be good for everyone. Personally I like a relaxed style of service.  My tips ... A starter is enough for two, so consider sharing.  Order a bottle of reserve Rioja to accompany your steak.

La Cabaña is the second best Argentine steakhouse I've been in my LIFE. If you're curious, my number one favorite is in Buenos Aires (La Brigada, get the entraña al punto). But I digress. La Cabaña's entraña al punto is the kind of meal I'll remember fondly years from now--just as I've salivated over memories of my dinner at La Brigada. Located walking distance from Plaza de Santa Ana, we got there at 9PM, which we thought was late enough. Dinner doesn't usually start until 11PM in Madrid, so bring the TUMS. By 10PM the restaurant was completely full (on a weekday), so reservations are recommended. It's so rare to get a steak so perfectly executed that it requires no salt, sauce, bread or fixings. Argentine steak is typically served at a perfect pink medium (al punto) with a crispy crust and mega moist middle. Our steaks were served on a communal platter that arrived sizzling and could have easily served 3-4. I said could have. We had no problems devouring it--every bite coupled with a head shake and close of the eyes to soak in the experience.",2012-12-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d796535-Reviews-or680-La_Cabana_Argentina-Madrid.html,UID_1610,0.02,0.829,0.151,0.9855,0.2266666666666666,0.5508333333333334,0.26775,1218,94,0.077175697865353,0,43,False,34,0.1851851851851851,0.1481481481481481,0.2592592592592592,0.037037037037037,0.1481481481481481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1851851851851851,0.037037037037037,219,156,4.566210045662101,0,0,need prefac follow half argentin half love cow lovingli grass fed pampa get soak sun la caba second best argentin steakhous life curiou number one favorit bueno air la brigada get entra al punto digress la caba entra al punto kind meal rememb fondli year saliv memori dinner la brigada locat walk distanc plaza de santa ana got pm thought late enough dinner usual start pm madrid bring tum pm restaur complet full weekday reserv recommend rare get steak perfectli execut requir salt sauc bread fix argentin steak typic serv perfect pink medium al punto crispi crust mega moist middl steak serv commun platter arriv sizzl could easili serv said could problem devour everi bite coupl head shake close eye soak experi,good review,4

But the steak was only decent, not exceptional. The service was friendly and fast. It was overpriced. TIP #1: they really undercook the steak here. I normally order my steaks medium rare and I can handle red centers and blood. I ordered it medium here and it came out quite rare. If you like your steak actually medium (warm pink center) then I would order it well done here. TIP #2: The steaks come with NO sides whatsoever. You'll need to order any sides. Most of the sides I saw being brought out to other tables looked large, so two sides would probably suffice for two people. I had the smaller ribeye (350 g; Bifo Lomo or something like that) and it was decent tasting but nothing exceptional. Since it was from Argentina I expected it to be exceptional, but it really wasn't. Most of the 28-day-dry-aged ribeyes that I get in North America taste far better than this steak. The ribeye at this restaurant was only decent and needed a lot more marbling to be a good ribeye. The mixed salad (Mixta) was actually quite decent. I have a lot of trouble finding regular salads in Europe, i.e., those with lettuce and tomatoes. Normally European salads seem to contain pickled asparagus and other weird ingredients. Fine if you want to try something new, but what if you just want lettuce and tomato? The mixed salad here had lots of very fresh and tasty lettuce and tomatoes. The bread that came with it was decent. The service was quick and friendly. I might try this restaurant again.

I cannot recommend this place enough. It is my secret gem; which I want to tell the world about. Value for money was excellent. Jaime really made my budget work and he did a wonderful menu.

I was at the door at 1:30 when they opened; by 2:00 they were full, the staff all now at work at full speed. I sat at the bar, since I was alone, though they offered me a table if I wanted one. I chose small portions of the day's three specials: a single oyster on the half shell, perfect, fresh, great texture, like it had just been pulled from the sea; tomatoes from the family farm with little green pepper and anchovy adornments, which were the best tomatoes I think I've ever eaten, though one of the young owner brothers lamented that his parents thought these not the best of their crop this year; a rice dish with cod cheek chunks (which I brought most of home with me for breakfast tomorrow, since I wanted to save room for dessert); and a roasted vegetable dish that I can only describe by telling you to order it for sure. A new bartender named Luis arrived after my oyster and all things from there were magic: hyper-vigilant, Luis is entertaining to watch and has great personality and taste in wine pairings. I just let him pick, and am grateful that he did. Dessert was an unusual porcini mushroom mousse with fresh fruits and a thyme crumble, just wonderful with the cream sherry Luis said was meant to be had with it.

Last Saturday we ended up getting there. Unfortunately we didn’t know you ought make a table reservation in advance, otherwise you won’t be served. Alternatively they told us we can go downstairs for a drink and some snacks if we fancy. I can only say it was fab!. Every single detail was cool, pleasant, cozy, warm... and the goods were outrageous. The staff members were great. Very kind, warm, polite... they really make you feel comfortable. Decoration was great. Wide sofas, poor lit room gives you intimacy, surrounded with spirits bottles everywhere and some vintage pictures. We ordered a fantastic red wine, I must recommend; ‘Yotuel’, although it’s name might evoke a joke, it was magnificent. 1). Tomato salad: nothing simpler than fresh and tasty tomato served on a plate. Some kosher salt, anchovies and jalapeños were aside just in case you wanted to mix them up. But plane tomato with some salt on top was pretty good. 2). Cheese sample board: around 9 different cheeses were presented to give them a try. Varieties such us: aged Gouda, Roquefort, Brie, Canarian cheese from Alegranza... although each has something unique, I would say Alegranza was one step over the rest. It was smoked and covered with truffle. Absolutely astonishing!. 3). Tacos: we tried pulled pork and langoustine taco. The first was warm, juicy, soft... very good one. The latter was cooler and you could feel avocado, coriander and the crunchiness of the langoustine. Wonderful! 4). Truffle mushrooms?: to be honest, I don’t recall the name of it. But I can still feel the fantastic mix of flavors in my mouth.  Basically consisted in a mushroom filled with a truffle sauce, and decorated with a fried quail egg. My goodness, what a wonderful bite!!! 5). Desserts: At this point we didn’t want eat any more, but somehow we decided to finish such a great dinner with some sweet. Chocolate coulant and black Forrest: the coulant is bizarre. The way the hot and cold merge in your mouth is a dream come true. The cake was performed differently. We could say it was their version of it. A sort of chocolate  Fudge with cream or truffle on top, and some berries ice cream aside. If you combine them you get a very interesting bite. Without any doubt, I must go. Do not hesitate for a second. I can’t wait to come again.

The owner is wonderful to interact with; he clearly takes great pride in his restaurant. We ate here twice, and had some of the more 'standard' options -- margherita, la diabola, and la rucolona. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of turnover, so the pizza selection is often limited to what's been made that day, and it isn't right out of the oven. That being said, the owner lovingly rejuvenates the slices on demand, and they do taste quite good. It's worth noting that the square slices that are made to be sold by the slice are significantly better than the mini round pies you can get to go, as the latter tend to be thinner crust and a little soggy near the center of the pie.",2014-01-07,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2086638-Reviews-or280-La_Pizzateca-Madrid.html,UID_1686,0.033,0.782,0.185,0.9811,0.2608392857142857,0.4905952380952382,0.60836,808,80,0.099009900990099,1,28,False,26,0.0526315789473684,0.1578947368421052,0.2631578947368421,0.1052631578947368,0.1578947368421052,0.1052631578947368,0.0,0.0,0.1052631578947368,0.0526315789473684,150,106,4.3933333333333335,0,0,ingredi use fresh top level like best pizza madrid owner wonder interact clearli take great pride restaur ate twice standard option margherita la diabola la rucolona unfortun lot turnov pizza select often limit made day right oven said owner lovingli rejuven slice demand tast quit good worth note squar slice made sold slice significantli better mini round pie get go latter tend thinner crust littl soggi near center pie,good review,4

The meal itself is one of the best Iv had, I don’t mind my meat pink and fleshy however if you prefer just a thin strip of pink make sure you ask for medium-well as my medium was probably more what you would receive if asking medium-rare in Scotland.

There's genuinely nothing more satisfying than than mindlessly cruising social media on your iPhone whilst indulging in truffle-sauced pizza of a Friday eve. In fact by about Wednesday evening I start getting serious cravings for that creamy, cheesy topping. Unfortunately it's quite a distraction and my productivity at work decreases exponentially as the week goes on in anticipation.

There is good selection of meat and also the possibility to order fish, for those who do not like meat. We were satisfied with our meal. I am not assigning 5 points for these reasons: 1) The price is slightly too high.

It looks well from the street, and the internal decor, while conservative, is pleasant. The heavy emphasis of the Menu is BEEF, and perhaps not surprisingly, there are very few ""Whites"" on the Winelist, but no ""big deal"" about that, we felt, as we contentedly settled-in to relax and enjoy ourselves, with only a handful of people around us. Our Server, as we look back on it, may have been a Trainee - unlike the very competent woman I had met when booking, she had no ""Name Badge"", and was not particularly self-assured. We ordered 1 Starter (to share) and a Main each, as well as some White (Rueda) & Red (Rioja) wine. So far, so good. We had barely sampled our Starter when our Server arrived at the table, somewhat agitated, asking ""can I bring the meat?"", to which our natural response (in words + hand signals), was ""not yet - give us 10 minutes!"". To our total amazement, she almost immediately landed-back bearing our Mains! We were practically speechless, and not surprisingly, our Server seemed suitably embarrassed. Between us all, we pushed aside the Starter so that our Mains could be pressed on us. To be fair, my Beef Milanese & my ""Better Half's"" Beef Tenderloin were both very good. But sadly, the quality of the food could not compensate for the grossly insensitive treatment we had just experienced - basically the Chef had forced the Mains on us to suit himself, not us! We eat out to savour and enjoy, not to have food stuffed down our throats at the whim of one thoughtless individual!! Anyway, having consumed the ""force-fed"" Mains, we requested ""La Cuenta"", declining an offer of Liqueurs. Our Server at this stage was apologetic, and we tried to convey to her that we did not blame her for what had happened - we asked could we speak to a ""Jefe"", but were told this was not possible. While not saying this to her, our feeling was that whoever was in charge lacked the ""cojones"" to face us! We paid our Bill of Euro 85-69 (not excessive, but perhaps at least the restaurant could have deducted the Starter charge?), without feeling inclined to add any gratuity. 'Shame - this restaurant has a basically good product, but surely customers shouldn't have their food rammed down their throats at the thoughtless whim of a Chef? And if you do ""screw up"", surely you should have the intestinal fortitude to face the aggrieved customer, and at least apologise?",2014-06-05,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d796535-Reviews-or660-La_Cabana_Argentina-Madrid.html,UID_1728,0.085,0.753,0.161,0.9926,0.1766049382716049,0.537753086419753,0.533695,2534,209,0.0824782951854775,6,112,False,50,0.1374045801526717,0.1526717557251908,0.2061068702290076,0.1068702290076335,0.1526717557251908,0.0534351145038167,0.0458015267175572,0.0229007633587786,0.099236641221374,0.0229007633587786,444,269,4.70945945945946,0,0,anoth restaur reconnoitr near excel catalonia la cort hotel duli book courteou pleasant young ladi look well street intern decor conserv pleasant heavi emphasi menu beef perhap surprisingli white winelist big deal felt contentedli settl relax enjoy hand peopl around us server look back may traine unlik compet woman met book name badg particularli self assur order starter share main well white rueda red rioja wine far good bare sampl starter server arriv tabl somewhat agit ask bring meat natur respons word hand signal yet give us minut total amaz almost immedi land back bear main practic speechless surprisingli server seem suitabl embarrass us push asid starter main could press us fair beef milanes better half beef tenderloin good sadli qualiti food could compens grossli insensit treatment experienc basic chef forc main us suit us eat savour enjoy food stuf throat whim one thoughtless individu anyway consum forc fed main request la cuenta declin offer liqueur server stage apologet tri convey blame happen ask could speak jefe told possibl say feel whoever charg lack cojon face us paid bill euro excess perhap least restaur could deduct starter charg without feel inclin add gratuiti shame restaur basic good product sure custom food ram throat thoughtless whim chef screw sure intestin fortitud face aggriev custom least apologis,bad review,2

Having come across it originally in passing the week previous, we liked the look of the it and based on the rave reviews from TripAdvisor, we agreed to return. We felt the menu was a little pricey at first however, as our stay was nearly over in Madrid, we thought we'd try it nonetheless and agreed that we would all be willing to pay for a good quality, well-cooked steak. What we were served however, was far from impressive. Yes, they were cooked to our varying preferences and were enjoyable but for €17/18 for a steak alone- no sides included- I would've expected something significantly better and am confident I could produce something of similar calibre myself... For much, much cheaper; quite surprised to read other reviews citing them as ""the best steak ever"" - far from it, actually. Also worth noting is the extra 10% IVA (tax) charge on the total bill, something which seems to be excluded from the menu prices quite slyly. We were not impressed either by the €3.50 water bottle charge for the table (despite asking for just a glass), nor the extra €1.70 for bread - per piece, per person; adding this up for our party of five comes to €8.50 extra on the bill (excluding tax) which is extreme for something we never asked for and believed was complimentary, especially in a restaurant that pitches itself so 'up-market'.  If it were based on the steaks alone, I would rate about average although the main cause of our discontent arose from an issue with two of the main courses coming out as the wrong order. When asked upon serving if these were the correct dishes the waitress replied that they were however, after a few seconds examining the plates we could evidently see that they were not.  Upon clarifying this with the waitress, she took back the dishes and informed us that she will bring back the correct orders. After 10 minutes waiting, watching the rest of our party finish their steaks, the waitress reappeared with what appeared to be the correct order. It was not long though until we realised that in fact they were the same pieces of meat as the previous plates, topped with cheese and the other listed ingredients and cooked further in the oven. With no desire to eat over-cooked or re-heated meat, both plates were abandoned after a few bites. When asked to speak to a supervisor, we were told by the same waitress that she was his wife and we could explain the issue to her. She claimed that we ordered the incorrect main courses and explained this to another female colleague in Spanish (who was apparently another supervisor but turned out to be no help in the matter)- strange given the fact she failed to mention this when we raised the issue with her first- and suggested we were lying. She confronted us with a very aggressive and moody attitude and when requesting the bill, mentioning our desire to not be charged for the two main courses, she then made a snide comment about both plates being ""half eaten"". I have never encountered a waitress with such an attitude in any restaurant; the fact she claimed to be the wife of the supervisor says very little for the restaurant as a whole. No apology was received from any member of staff. At all. Would certainly not recommend visiting until they reevaluate their customer service.

There’s a small bar area as you enter the restaurant which became quite busy as the World Cup was on and they were showing the Argentina vs Holland game. The atmosphere in the place was fantastic. We all ordered steaks some Fillet, some Ribeye, and they we all cooked to perfection, with the exception of the ‘Well Done’ one which wasn’t ‘Well Done’ enough, so they quickly took it back and killed it some more.

The look of the restaurant is as if it has been set in a person's living room - I was also a little dismissive as to the amount of sweetbreads on the English menu.

That said, we were made to feel welcome immediately, with a friendly smile, and the owner recommended some dishes to us.  The restaurant soon filled up, however, and the restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere - striking a good balance between being somewhat private but not too isolating!

One is the chef (who also takes lovely photos when she travels!) and the other is front of house. This is not your mass-market chain and is highly one-of-a-kind.  We turned up a touch early at 9:25pm and had to ring the doorbell because they do not open till 9:30. Inviting open dining room that does look like a family's front room. Probably only 8 tables and on this evening it was half Spanish and half foreigners though suspect normally more Spanish regulars.  Booking was easy by email or online.  The two ladies spoke good English and there are some menus also in English.  The food was good - though a touch confusing on what was 'meant' to be a starter or a main. All was consistently high quality. One of our party had snails, another superb asparagus and I shared excellent jamon with my wife. I had baby squid as a main course.  Wine list was short and geared around their house wine from Rioja. Full bodied and suited to the food.  The service was a delight and fun - like a mother checking on her extended family at the various tables. By the end you almost feel like old friends. Lovely for an evening out with friends or as a couple but maybe not if you plan for a very quiet meal to propose!?  No music though which is great and tables have very reasonable gaps between them.  Whole meal with three courses for four of us with two bottles came to 200E.

Despite our best effort not to order too much food, the recommendations won us over. The appetizer cucumber soup was very refreshing, I can imagine eating this for summer too. The most memorable dishes were the stewed squid and the quail thign. The freshly made pasta with mushroom and bacon was also a hit. It was simple and delicious, something that Mum would make anytime. The desserts were rather homely, with the mousse really light and sweet, but not cloying so.

They source all their produce at a farm not far from Madrid. We had a beautiful tomato salad of a particular variety that was in season with just sea salt and olive oil and of course incredible bread. Then on to their ratatouille (pisto) that was fresh from their great produce and had the oxtail cannelloni for the main. Every dish came out at the right pace. Not too fast or slow. Also do not forget to ask for wine suggestions. This is a wine bar as well so they have everything by the glass. Each selection commended was superb. To top off the great food I would be remiss to not mention how professional and obviously proud of their product and how nice the staff was. What a terrific experience in Spain.

Thank you TA! After an initial glitch with the reservations, it was all great! Any good restaurant relies on a combination of front of house and kitchen skills ... these sisters have it down pat!  The lovely lady in the dining room guided us through the menu (encouraging my friends to be more adventurous ... ""why would you come to Madrid and order pasta"") First two lovely hors d'oeuvres: a hake terrine, light as can be, and a porcion of one of the richest pates I've had the chance to sample in some time. At the hostess's suggestion we stuck with the house wine, a lovely crianza. For first courses we sampled the sardines, lovely, meaty and just briny enough; the duck confit with leeks (served instead with white asparagus and exceptional); a beautiful salad with perfectly cooked pulpo; and the croquettas, a bit cheesey for me, but my friends loved them. Entrees brought oxtails, so simple so rich in a gorgeous broth/gravy and topped with matchstick fried potatoes; the solomillo pork sirloin, served with an intense reduction of onions that had friends wiping the plate; and an order of the pasta with bacon and mushrooms (though she discouraged it, my buddy wanted pasta and he was quite happy with this take on carbonara).  There are 3 desserts on the menu so we sampled them all ... the rice pudding was more of a custard with less rice than anticipated; the apple/toffee confection was incredible and the chocolate torte was rich and dark We were among the last tables and the chef came out to chat with us ... such a treat!

I asked a local and was directed to a purple painted house with its door closed. We had booked a tabled for 9.30 and got to the door at 9.25, after knocking the door was opened, we said we had a reservation for 9.30 and the lady said 'well its only 9.25!). We realised later that the place didn't open until 9.30. However, we were allowed in and were the only diners there until another group came in as we were leaving at 11.00. It is rather liked being in someone's home and after eating the two sisters engaged us in deep conversation about politics, the EU and other weighty matters for some considerable time. The food was good, albeit from a very short menu list, the sisters very pleasant and interesting and the experience was somewhat out of the ordinary which added variety to our stay in Madrid. We found the pricing to be a little on the high side considering that we did not have a dessert.

Overall, we were very disappointed as our experience was not at all as expected.  We had hoped to take our time and enjoy our evening. We asked the owner who greeted us to choose our wines. We ordered half size appetizers, the octopus and the leeks. For our taste, the leeks were over cooked and over rated. For our mains we had the cod and the veal cannelloni. My veal cannelloni was so over cooked that it was basically just pasty mush. My husband ordered the creme brûlée for dessert, against my wishes as I was already unhappy with the meal. We were not surprised to be disappointed again by the runny, soupy brûlée.

Food was good -- the oxtail and octopus salad both delicious. Homemade pasta also delicious. Did not love the bacalao with tomato sauce -- too fishy in taste for us, and we eat a lot of fish.  However, be careful in selecting this restaurant if you have young kids who are picky eaters or who may not enjoy the lengthy dining experience of a formal meal. Our experience was ruined by the overly obnoxious comments from the hostess who reprimanded us about our picky eater. On the plus side: they reluctantly agreed to make an existing menu item (fresh pasta with bacon and mushrooms) as plain pasta with nothing on it for our picky eater. We appreciated this gesture, and were willing to have him sit with no food rather than inconvenience the restaurant if it was too much trouble to make the plain pasta. (Which we explained in Spanish when we ordered. We recognized we were asking for a favor.). On the negative side: the hostess insulted our child, our parenting, and our unwillingness to force him to eat more diverse food at the restaurant several times. She justified these comments by saying she was like a grandmother, telling us what she thought. Our child was not loud, disruptive, rude, or in any way bothering any other diners in the small dining room, so her comments really were about her own personal feelings not about ensuring other diners in the restaurant had a nice time. Also when I did not care for the bacalao, so did not finish it, her comment was that Americans eat a lot of food ('always eat so much') so why wasn't I eating it. Essentially the insults-based service got old by the end of dinner. This would have been valuable information for us to know when booking the restaurant because I would not have chosen to make a reservation here had I known that they were not tolerant of kids. Come here as a couple for a romantic dinner, or for a more adult dining experience -- the interactions with the sisters provides a unique experience of the culture, and I'm sure the hostess would be more enjoyable then.

And we did not regret it!  It's a pretty small take away restaurant, but there are a few spots where you can sit to eat your order. We both had a pizza with two different halfs, so we got to taste four different kinds of pizza; romana (with potatoes and truffle cream), napolitana (anchovies), roja (bolognese) and genovesa (pesto). All of these were very good, but the romana was absolutely amazing. I never had a pizza with potatoes before, but seriously, you should order this one!

Vengo aquí dos veces semanalmente ahora porque la pizza es TAN buena que no puedo evitarla x los findes. Empiezo cuando termino la semana de trabajo y vuelvo con una amiga casi siempre. Las pizzas llevan ingredientes muy frescos y bastantes deliciosos. Cada pizza, incluso los para llevar o comer en la barra en frente estan hechas con amor y atención. Nunca he pedido una porción, da igual de que parte de la bandeja era, que era mala. Si tienes el tiempo, déjate sentar y comer porque las pizzas hecho del momento son aún más riquísimas! Con una Alhambra para acompañarla, la pizza de La Pizzateca ha ganado la posición más alta y favorita en mi corazón de toda la capital (y tengo bastantes amigüitos Italianos que hacen una buena pizza, eh?). Los empleados son cariñosos y atentos, bilingües (por se a caso), y los jefes son majísimos! Vete prontísimo a La Pizzateca, ¡¡no lo vas a lamentar!! ==English== Disclaimer: I eat here twice a week now because my typical once a week has become insufficient!! La Pizzateca has become my favorite pizza joint in the entire capital region and I have quit a few Italian restaurant-owning friends! The pizza has fresh delicious ingredients, made fresh all day long, and I have yet to find anything comparable in tastiness and quality of ingredients and texture/crispiness etc etc. New Yorkers and lovers of that style of pizza (personally I'm a Sicilian guy, i like doughy thick pizza) will LOVE this stuff!

One sister runs the front of the house while the other prepares the food as it's ordered. We ate a variety of dishes, including the ox-tail and the sweetbreads with leeks and fava beans. Amazing! But the standout dish was the fresh pasta with bacon and mushrooms. It was a simple dish, but the flavors were unbelievable. The pasta here was better than any pasta dish we ate in Rome. And the sisters are a delightful pair, indeed! They both seemed happy to learn I live in Atlanta, Georgia, because the chef is a fan of ""Gone With the Wind.""

The restaurant was like you were entering some-ones house, this in intentional and adds to the character. The two sisters who run this place are very friendly and welcoming. Lots of chatter at our table. The food is decent home cooked food. We had their tasting menu. The pate was very good as were the chargrilled baby tomatoes. The cod was ok, cooked well, but quite fishy, soggy skin and a tomato sauce that doesn't come close to the one I cook myself at home. The pork with caramelised onions was ok, though the large medallion (few different sizes on the plate) was still raw in the middle. I assume this was intentional, though too underdone for my taste.

We went from a table of ten to a group of 20 which is the maximum the restaurant can take at one time and we all arrived at once which was a challenge for the restaurant as there are only two people in the kitchen and two serving but they managed magnificently. The restaurant is a little house and so it is just like eating in someone's home. Our group loved it and some of them wanted to go back the next night and were disappointed that it was closed. This included one of the vegetarians who was so pleased to have been especially catered for. This is not four star Michelin dining but you really do get the feeling that you are eating in Spain.

This is a small, intimate restaurant run by two sisters who coddle their guests- trust whatever is recommended, including wine choices! I had an amazing octopus salad as a starter- clean, fresh coins of octopus over wilted arugula- SO good I polished off the plate and would only give my spouse one bite! He started with a salad of mixed greens with dried venison, pine nuts & raisins. Also good! Then he got the oxtail- which was a stretch for us but turned out to be delightful! Super tender with a savory sauce- yum. I got pork with braised onions and loved it! Go with the older version of the house Rioja (older as in aged longer)- it was amazing! Then we had yummy coffee with roasted apples with a toffee cream for me and an unusual chocolate dessert for hubby, it was like chocolate toffee- really good! The entire meal was under E100! There is just one setting per night, it opens at 9:30, I suggest making reservations for that time and plan on a 3 hour dinner!

We had planned to go to another restaurant but it was not open. We later discovered it opens at 9.00 p.m which is too late for me. This place was open, looked nice and the menu suited us so we went in. We chose a pasta dish each, I had ravioli and my husband had cannelloni which we had with a salad and a glass of delicious red wine (Malbec). I realise this was an odd choice for an Argentinian restaurant but we wanted something light. Both dishes were nicely cooked and the service was good. The price was reasonable for a capital city, so a couple of days later we chose to eat there again. This time my husband had a steak with Roquefort sauce and I chose chicken with tomato and mozzarella. My husband's port was generous enough but mine was simply huge! I ate a good part and my husband helped me out but it was just too much. If like other places you can share I'd suggest you do with this and maybe order their roasted red peppers or a salad to go with it. Because we are so early it was very quiet and so it is difficult to comment on the atmosphere but it was nicely laid out and the service both times was very friendly and professional.",2015-04-26,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d796535-Reviews-or630-La_Cabana_Argentina-Madrid.html,UID_1872,0.024,0.82,0.156,0.9899,0.1554012345679012,0.5317901234567901,0.3786750000000001,1204,130,0.1079734219269103,1,22,False,43,0.1351351351351351,0.1621621621621621,0.2702702702702703,0.054054054054054,0.1891891891891892,0.0,0.0,0.054054054054054,0.054054054054054,0.081081081081081,237,142,4.084388185654008,0,0,use eat late spain plan go anoth restaur open later discov open p late place open look nice menu suit us went chose pasta dish ravioli husband cannelloni salad glass delici red wine malbec realis odd choic argentinian restaur want someth light dish nice cook servic good price reason capit citi coupl day later chose eat time husband steak roquefort sauc chose chicken tomato mozzarella husband port gener enough mine simpli huge ate good part husband help much like place share suggest mayb order roast red pepper salad go earli quiet difficult comment atmospher nice laid servic time friendli profession,good review,4

We figured it may be touristy as it was located near some of the hotels and museums, but there were a handful of locals in there. We stopped in for dinner on a whim. The pizza was amazing...and we only had the vegetarian fare. If you are specifically expecting New York or Chicago style pizza, you are not going to find that. What you will find, though, are unique flavor combinations and very fresh pizzas. I believe we tried four slices: cheese, margherita, mushrooms/truffle oil, and potatoes (I've never had anything like the potato pizza). The crust, cheese, and sauces all tasted very fresh. What puts this place over the top is the owner. A very nice guy, if not a little quirky, and you can tell he is passionate about his craft. It shines through in his pizza.

From the outside it looks quite quiet but don't let that fool you - eating here is like being welcomed into someone's home and treated like an honored guest. The manageress was full of helpful suggestions and funny comments and makes you feel incredibly welcome, even when I accidentally broke a lamp bulb. We shared two starters and then had a main each which includes some amazing canapes and 'warm up' dishes, and with a couple of glasses of wine each it came to around E80 for dinner for two which felt like a great deal. The cooking is from the Rioja area with dishes as simple as sardines in oil through to a complex octopus stew and oxtail that melted in the mouth.

No problem there but the lack of locals provided a first indication.  The table we were sat was bouncing. The owner's response was: ""you can't lean your arms on the table"". No fix here.  Wine menu came (had to wash my hands afterwards). Bottles that had not been updated in years. We asked for a 2001 reserve and were told that the only available was a 2008. ""So, there must be a difference in price then? (I asked). Answ: No, years don't matter, the only thing that matters is the price"".  The menu was brief, but quick and concise better than extensive and undeliverable, Right?. No. when the food came is was served on plates that had seen better days and well below average. €14 for a french omelet. 2 tiny new potatoes with my cod which should have been swimming in sauce but had less than butter on a toast.  Bathrooms ... clearly trying to be carbon neutral here. The light was on a timer that did not last more than 30 seconds. Keeping in mind that the lid had to be kept up with the left hand, right hand busy, light off ... pitch black adventure.

The clientele is business men and locals that appreciate the food. What is on the menu? Meat, meat and more meat. Yes you can eat fish, but why should you? The meat is of supreme quality, and a 500g ribeye for 29,99€ in my eyes a bargain in such a restaurant. I like that the side dishes are very limited but again like the meat top quaility. The wine list is extensive and, well, also in my eyes expensive. Choose well or go with the recommendations of the waiter rather than just order.

Whether you sit at the bar or take a table, the food is high quality and fun, the service is friendly and engaging, and the wine list and wine pairings are on a different level altogether. I would recommend any winelover to just leave yourselves in the hands of the staff to try wines by the glass and half glass with different dishes. Not only will they give you some really high quality, fun pairings, they will also explain them to you and have no problem whatsoever adapting to personal tastes. And if there is one other area in which they excel it is cheeses: you must leave room for cheeses. Again, a fantastic offering, beautifully presented and explained.  Then the American Bar downstairs: one of Madrid's very top cocktail bars. Plenty of room to sit, perch or lean, and a fantastic combination of classic and updated cocktails of every kind, with some really fun presentations. Top recommendation - go to the bar and watch the boys in action. As good as anything you will see. And if you prefer your booze neat, you won't believe the collection of old bottles they have.
