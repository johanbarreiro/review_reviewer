The Reineta was five minutes from our hotel and seemed to have a varied menu. I booked a table for four on-line was so pleased with my choice. The restaurant was full on a Saturday evening and we were the first ones in at 9.00 p.m. The waitresses were really friendly and helpful. My wife and I (the vegetarians) thought the entire meal (starter, main and dessert) was delicious. We think our meat eating cousins eating veggie food for a change enjoyed theirs - they certainly cleared their plates. Other positives were a bright, clean restaurant and the most delicious carrot juice I've ever had!!

At the recommendation, the four of us shared a huge T bone steak - all of us thought it was tasty and prepared well. I went back to El Neru two nights later , and my experience was not as as good (maybe different chef) - the fish soup was bland , and the merluza cocida was disappointing - it was like some steamed merluza with a few chunks of potatoes (not like the stew I was expecting). The squid cooked in ink sauce was the best dish during my second time at el neru - the sauce was great .

When we got back, the bar was full and we worried we might have lost our chance, but that place is like the Tardis, a labyrinth of dining areas. We know all about tourist traps (we live in a Canarian tourist resort) and, contrary to some reviewers here, we didn't have that experience here. It certainly isn't a ""posh"" restaurant, but we had a pleasant meal where everything happened in an orderly way. We started with a bottle of cider to accompany the bread and allioli. The waiter went through the pouring routine - okay, that was touristy and he didn't do it for the Spanish family party at the next table, but no harm done. At least he cleaned up after himself :) . As it was an Asturian restaurant we passed on our favourite rabo de toro and plumped for the fabada. Specialities are always the ones to go for, and this was no exception - simple but tasty.

I was looking for one of the best Asturianos in Madrid and I mistakenly ran across this place due to the relatively good reviews it had received. Needless to say you can never underestimate the poor taste of the general public.  1. BURNT FOOD - The cachopo I ordered was completely burnt  2. SERVICE CHARGE - They charge for “bread”- For me this is a complete turn off and just a way to gouge tourists for more money. (This meant bread and silverware) 3. FRAUDULENT ADVERTISING - The prices on the menu outside don’t correspond to the prices on the menu inside. I’m sure this has to be illegal but I guess it’s their way of enticing the unwary tourist into the wolf’s mouth. 4. RUDE MANAGER - The service was bad and the manager was completely rude. He didn’t help to resolve any of our concerns and instead responded to us with a very “macarra” attitude that one would expect to find in Benidorm or Magaluf rather than in the historic city center of Madrid In conclusion, don’t step foot in this place.

We couldn't visit Madrid and not see flamenco, so we booked this show and were absolutely mesmerized. Like others, we booked this trip while on Sandemans walking tour. The venue is very intimate - probably about 100 or so patrons. We, a family of 4, sat at our own table and were served with a drink. Other options included dinner, but we chose against that. Nobody in the room was more than 20 feet or so away from the stage. There were 4 dancers who danced one at a time along with a couple of singers and a great guitarist.

Walking in to this luxurious restaurant gave me the impression that I would need a Jacket to dine here, ""Hola, habla usted Inglés?"" We were greeted with a smile and was asked ""do we have a reservation?"" ""no"" we exclaimed and right away they knew we were American and was about to spend some ""MONEY!"" Lol Just kidding, they did seat us and we had some more drinks and some wine. The vibe was nice and the decor and colors in the restaurant just pooped, our last night in Madrid. As one person put it this felt ""Intimate and elegant"" experience, again the staff, our Maitre D was excellent she did not speak much English but she knew what we wanted and was there assisting others, the staff some spoke English and they also were excellent in every way. I saw a older gentleman leaving out and he had his coat hanging up, on the way out he stoped and a staff put his coat on for him, he never touched the coat, it just slid right on him like a super hero suite and he was out the door lol! The food was great the ambiance was awesome, party's or 2 and 5 and another group had a table with 12 at a mammoth table off to the side in its own room elevated up about two or three steps. After indulging in some more libations and desserts I decided to take a trip to the bathroom ""Bano.""   I shouldn't talk about using the restroom in this manor but ""WOW!"" I was blown away! OK moving on. This restaurant is like one of your best restaurants you go to in any Large City in the US or anywhere in the world, Excellent service and excellent food, we had some Ravioli stuffed with prawns, the Fish of the day and Martini Chocolate mousse.

My compliments to the bartender. These were some of the best Mojitos I have tasted in Madrid. The server brought us a delicious tomato soup to try that was on the house. Next we had bread and olive oil followed by a Burrata Cheese salad that was delicious. They serve artisan tacos so my husband got the Shrimp Tacos for an entrée and I got the Ropa Vieja (shredded meats) tacos with a quail egg on top . We decided to share and they were both tasty! A little plate of colorful gumdrops was served for dessert (however, there are desserts on the menu - we were just too full to order more food).

What kind of restaurant is this? Is this the character of an elegant restaurant?I don't understand. We have been to their other restaurant in London, and it was really nice. I was expecting something like that here as well but after seeing this, I don't know if i am going back there again. I feel sorry for employees. Maybe other clients won't agree with me but I wish i had not experienced this circumstances. If i haven't seen this, maybe it would have been a great experience for us and i would have given 5 stars.

Staff greeted us nicely and despite not having booked ( I would recommend that you did) they helpfully found us a table.  I am a coeliac, so finding somewhere that provides good quality, Spanish food is often difficult but they were very helpful. Whilst they did not have a separate menu, they pointed out what I could have and made special potatoes in a clean pan. NB if you don't already know this term, always ask if the chips are cooked in a clean pan, that way they won't be contaminated by other gluten containing items.  We ate spinach and mozzarella salad, followed by very tender pork chops with pears and onions which were delicious. Wine was good value and the service was great.  I would defiantly go here again if I return to Madrid.  Note, this is not the Cava Maria at Playa Mayor, but the same chain.

The food was actually a very interesting mix of plates and we ordered a few appetizers as well as main courses. Everything was very good, which I was impressed with given the eclectic nature of the food. They have excellent ceviche and an excellent Reuben sandwhich for example (2 things I wouldn't expect a single restaurant to do well at the same time). The ambience is of course excellent being an Platea and having full view of the stage (there was a 1950s rock&roll band playing which was great). So why give it a 1 star. Well, unfortunately, all these great aspects were completely overshadowed by the fact that the restaurant's supervisors are completely ill-equipped to deal with a table with children (well-behaved children btw). We were 4 adults with 2 kids (2 and 5 years old). 1 of my kids unfortunately is very picky with food, so we asked the waitress if it was possible to serve a plate of white rice. The answer was no (strange, as they have at least 1 plate with sushi rice as the base). Then we asked if they had breaded chicken. The answer again was no. They did suggest another ""chicken breast"" option for kids, which I ordered knowing at least 1 of my kids would eat it. I then asked the waitress if it would be possible to get a tapa of breaded chicken from the other Platea bars downstairs (mind you, we are 4 adults and another child all ordering food and drinks from Canalla). She of course, cited the policy of the restaurant not to bring in outside food. I get it. Good policy on paper. But a policy one could bend for a 2 year old, if 4 adults are patronizing your restaurant and you refuse to make something as simple as a bowl of rice. We were told no, but my 2 year old still needed something more than the bread at the table. We pulled out some snacks from our baby backpack so he could eat something as well. That is when the harassment by the supervisory staff started. First, 2 women dressed in black suits with ear pieces (different than waiters) proceeded to stare us down for 20-30 minutes. Straight stare. I even tried to stare back in hopes they'd get the message that it was extremely uncomfortable, but they did not budge. They then approached the table and proceeded to lecture us that we couldn't have any outside food (let's remember, this is for a 2 year old... not like we brought our own wine or something). Ironically, at the same time they brought our food orders by, and the ""chicken breast"" was in fact breaded. I had literally asked if they had ""breaded chicken"" the first time and they said no (this is in Spanish btw, and there was definitely nothing lost in confusion, as my mother tongue is spanish). But at this point, we were already being lectured, with no real purpose of the outcome they wanted (did they want us to stand up and leave? no...). I asked to speak to the restaurant manager at that point, as they were rudely interrupting what should have been a nice lunch out watching some live music. The restaurant manager eventually came, as we were in the middle of our meal, and also proceeded to lecture without first asking what had happened (maybe good to get the customer's perspective too, before just going off on a customer based on the one-sided info from that staff)? Anyway, we finished our meal, and paid and on our way out asked for a Hoja de Reclamacion (a formal customer rights document establishments in Spain are forced to carry). That was the first time we heard a ""sorry for how this was handled, and that we hope you return"". Funny how the threat of a formal complaint changes attitudes. Anyway - I'd recommend the restaurant... but just not to anybody who has any toddlers who may not be interested in creative fusion dishes for more sophisticated pallates than a 2 year old.",2019-09-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12883647-Reviews-Canalla_Bistro_by_Ricard_Camarena-Madrid.html,UID_46602,0.062,0.839,0.099,0.9715,0.1159911358482786,0.5237902494331066,0.4291147058823529,3788,336,0.0887011615628299,0,116,False,137,0.1048951048951049,0.1468531468531468,0.2867132867132867,0.0489510489510489,0.2027972027972027,0.0209790209790209,0.0069930069930069,0.0559440559440559,0.0839160839160839,0.0419580419580419,689,357,4.499274310595065,0,0,let start good food actual interest mix plate order appet well main cours everyth good impress given eclect natur food excel cevich excel reuben sandwhich exampl thing expect singl restaur well time ambienc cours excel platea full view stage rock roll band play great give star well unfortun great aspect complet overshadow fact restaur supervisor complet ill equip deal tabl children well behav children btw adult kid year old kid unfortun picki food ask waitress possibl serv plate white rice answer strang least plate sushi rice base ask bread chicken answer suggest anoth chicken breast option kid order know least kid would eat ask waitress would possibl get tapa bread chicken platea bar downstair mind adult anoth child order food drink canalla cours cite polici restaur bring outsid food get good polici paper polici one could bend year old adult patron restaur refus make someth simpl bowl rice told year old still need someth bread tabl pull snack babi backpack could eat someth well harass supervisori staff start first women dress black suit ear piec differ waiter proceed stare us minut straight stare even tri stare back hope get messag extrem uncomfort budg approach tabl proceed lectur us outsid food let rememb year old like brought wine someth iron time brought food order chicken breast fact bread liter ask bread chicken first time said spanish btw definit noth lost confus mother tongu spanish point alreadi lectur real purpos outcom want want us stand leav ask speak restaur manag point rude interrupt nice lunch watch live music restaur manag eventu came middl meal also proceed lectur without first ask happen mayb good get custom perspect go custom base one side info staff anyway finish meal paid way ask hoja de reclamacion formal custom right document establish spain forc carri first time heard sorri handl hope return funni threat formal complaint chang attitud anyway recommend restaur anybodi toddler may interest creativ fusion dish sophist pallat year old,average review,3,American

The place is spectacular, a wonderful option for these incredibly hot summer days. We arrived around 3:30 pm and the kitchen of Canalla Bistro closes at 4:00 pm (they open again for at 8:30 pm for dinner), but they offered us a table and it worked out perfectly. We were surprised from the beginning, since the tables are located in what used to be the balcony of the theater. There is a large stage with its huge curtains in the front, and there was a flamenco dancer on what used to be the patio. After the flamenco show, a DJ was presented on the stage. The atmosphere was lively and fun. The food was fantastic! We enjoyed everything!. We had Croquetas al Pesto de Albahaca (croquettes with basil pesto), Buñuelo Cremoso y Crujiente de Bacalao con Emulsión de Miso (Creamy and Crunchy Cod Fritters), Gyozas de Cerdo Hoisin de Pimientos y Yuzu-Ponzu (Pork Pot Stickers with Hoisin Sauce), Pan al Vapor con Cochinita Pibil (Steamed Bun with Pork), Canelon de Aguacate con Bonito Marinado y Pico de Gallo (Avocado Caneloni with Bonito Flakes and Pico de Gallo)`and Causa Limeña de Corvina Ahumada (Fish Peruvian Causa). Original flavors and combinations, nicely plated, we wanted to lick the dishes!! For dessert, the Chocolate Cake was awesome. A base of chocolate cake, topped with chocolate mousse and a crispy chocolate cookie as thin as paper, with little chips of chocolate in every bite. A chocolate invasion in your mouth!

After standing awkwardly for a few minutes trying to get the attention of one of the 3 waitresses that were standing in the room we were finally told that they would be with us in a minute and we were shown around the buffet.The food on offer is a small selection of meats, tapas, paella, bread and some vegan options in one room. In another there are a few desserts and some beverages on offer.  The hotel restaurant has a very high class decor with an art deco feel, however service detail tends to lack. This should be pretty straight forward as the brunch is a self service buffet with a choice of 3 hot options available to order. We were constantly left with several empty plates on our table for up to 45 minutes. I could understand if the restaurant was busy but it was 35 percent capacity at best.  The food on offer was a nice standard and delicious however for a high end hotel, I find it hard to believe that there was no orange juice available when requested. Also the hotel seems to be very proud to offer their own ""hot fudge"" liquid chocolate made exclusively on site however some fresh fruit or churros would compliment it well as at 75% it is a little bitter on its own.  All in all the atmosphere is very relaxed and pleasant with a DJ playing in the corner but a better attention to detail from the staff working there would ensure a more enjoyable experience",2019-10-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12448512-Reviews-YOUnique_Restaurant-Madrid.html,UID_46623,0.041,0.786,0.172,0.9934,0.2009369369369369,0.5500090090090092,0.4672,1503,139,0.0924817032601463,0,18,False,54,0.1166666666666666,0.1666666666666666,0.35,0.0666666666666666,0.15,0.05,0.0166666666666666,0.0,0.0666666666666666,0.0166666666666666,279,168,4.379928315412187,0,0,littl confus arriv street entranc walk straight middl restaur stand awkwardli minut tri get attent one waitress stand room final told would us minut shown around buffet food offer small select meat tapa paella bread vegan option one room anoth dessert beverag offer hotel restaur high class decor art deco feel howev servic detail tend lack pretti straight forward brunch self servic buffet choic hot option avail order constantli left sever empti plate tabl minut could understand restaur busi percent capac best food offer nice standard delici howev high end hotel find hard believ orang juic avail request also hotel seem proud offer hot fudg liquid chocol made exclus site howev fresh fruit churro would compliment well littl bitter atmospher relax pleasant dj play corner better attent detail staff work would ensur enjoy experi,average review,3,French

The food was good...,"The good: Having been just recently to Canalla Bistro in Valencia where I was blown away by the creative and very tasteful menu I had high hopes for the visit to the restaurant bearing the same name by the same chef. The food was good but in no way as good and fresh as in Valencia (don't dump the sauce over the tempura veggetable - it was a mush!). It was just lacking that Wow factor. We were surprised to hear that none of the staff, who was very friendly and attended to all our needs during our visit, ever had visited the local in Valencia. It might be a good idea so they see what they’re up against! As it was our wedding anniversary we received a complimentary glass of champagne, which I thought was a nice touch.  The bad: The restaurant was closed from the 1st to the 30th of August (welcome to Spain). The only option to make a reservation was online. A couple of days later I wanted to move the reservation by half an hour. Sadly the phone number provided went straight to voice mail reminding me that the place was closed, even though by now it was the 31st of August. I wrote a message on their FB page hoping someone would read it and called the restaurant in Valencia to see if they can reach someone in Madrid to let them know that their phone line isn’t working but they supposedly had no way of contacting Madrid – really? I called again on the 1st of September just to get the same message. I eventually got a reply on my FB post that there was a technical error and someone would call me. No one called me. I wrote another post and I got another message calling me Oscar (why, I have no idea) and saying that they will get to the bottom of the issue. Over the course of three days I had not been able to change my reservation. Eventually we just walked in 30 minutes after the original reservation time. The reason why I'm writing this in detail as a bad experience is that the restaurant itself says that tables will only be hold for 15 minutes after reservation time! I don’t care how many Michelin stars or Repsol Suns a chef won, for me as a customer it’s the whole package that counts and for a restaurant where I don’t leave under 150 EUR for two people I expect the service to be outstanding from beginning to the end of the experience. The conclusion: Canalla Bistro Madrid can’t compete with its sister restaurant in Valencia. The food is ok but not as fresh and innovative as expected. The staff at the restaurant is nevertheless friendly and accommodating. It might help though to send them to Valencia to see how it is done and to let them know what they are up against. Due to a technical issue (as their statement) with their phone number during three days it was a very annoying and at the end impossible experience to simply change a reservation. It’s sadly no thumbs up, the food in the food court downstairs of Platea is definitely better.",2018-09-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d12883647-Reviews-or10-Canalla_Bistro_by_Ricard_Camarena-Madrid.html,UID_5102,0.066,0.781,0.153,0.995,0.1528993055555555,0.5436904761904762,0.3588583333333333,2881,276,0.0958000694203401,3,47,False,78,0.134020618556701,0.1134020618556701,0.2474226804123711,0.0721649484536082,0.1443298969072164,0.0412371134020618,0.0206185567010309,0.0515463917525773,0.1030927835051546,0.0721649484536082,541,277,4.32532347504621,0,0,good recent canalla bistro valencia blown away creativ tast menu high hope visit restaur bear name chef food good way good fresh valencia dump sauc tempura vegget mush lack wow factor surpris hear none staff friendli attend need visit ever visit local valencia might good idea see wed anniversari receiv complimentari glass champagn thought nice touch bad restaur close st th august welcom spain option make reserv onlin coupl day later want move reserv half hour sadli phone number provid went straight voic mail remind place close even though st august wrote messag fb page hope someon would read call restaur valencia see reach someon madrid let know phone line work supposedli way contact madrid realli call st septemb get messag eventu got repli fb post technic error someon would call one call wrote anoth post got anoth messag call oscar idea say get bottom issu cours three day abl chang reserv eventu walk minut origin reserv time reason write detail bad experi restaur say tabl hold minut reserv time care mani michelin star repsol sun chef custom whole packag count restaur leav eur two peopl expect servic outstand begin end experi conclus canalla bistro madrid compet sister restaur valencia food ok fresh innov expect staff restaur nevertheless friendli accommod might help though send valencia see done let know due technic issu statement phone number three day annoy end imposs experi simpli chang reserv sadli thumb food food court downstair platea definit better,bad review,2,Spanish

Brits may not expect to find a good food service place inside a mall but, nevertheless, there is one here. The main area at ground floor level is ringed by small food outlets and small bars where the locals come for lunch and dinner. We did as advised by our very friendly hotel staff and rolled up at lunchtime for some very agreeable tapas and 'a glass of'. Our waitress was very accommodating with all our questions and she suggested we return for dinner that (Saturday) night as there is a show. So we did exactly that but we booked a table in the rather posher restaurant on the first floor and overlooking the performance area. What a good decision that was ! I grant you - a Saturday evening show in a shopping mall doesn't normally fill a customer will excitement or expectation of a good time but a good time was had, and no mistake. The big jazz band was completely to our taste and the fit half-naked Spanish bloke hanging and swinging from the ceiling seemed to do it for my wife !!

For the entree we had the famous spanish paella which was delicious and for dessert we had flan and also the option of granizado.

We arrived Saturday evening about 8.30pm which is early for the locals to have dinner, but we were hungry and to begin with were the only ones in the restaurant. After we had been seated the place filled up within half an hour, and there was a healthy buzz to the place with all the table upstairs having been taken. We were too lazy to work out the English for everything on the menu so went for the Degustaçian de Tapas which was a very reasonably priced €30 for the two of us. We also ordered some patatas fritas which were sensational. As the tapas began arriving we knew we were in for a treat as each one of them was sensational – Japanese rolls with a thick sticky soy sauce, salmon with gravadlax, a tangy salad and tuna. These were followed by chilli con carne, langoustines, mini-hamburgers, dumplings and a wonderfully meaty ‘bombe’. Each was a taste sensation, lovingly prepared and wonderfully executed. The finale – a gooey chocolate cake presented in a pool of custard and cheesecake rounded off the most satisfying meal of the weekend. The staff were great, indeed I can’t find anything to fault about this extraordinary restaurant - superb value for money as well as out of this world cuisine.

We didn't understand what was on the menu so what we received was all guesswork. We were first presented with cold tapas which consisted of sushi, a delicious salad, gravalax and potted tuna. The hot tapas then followed with mini burgers, bbq'd prawns, dumplings and the recommended bomba which is a deep fried potato filled with a delicious meaty sauce. We also got two desserts with the deal. These were an amazing cheesecake and a rich hot chocolate pudding. The decor was fantastic as was the service.

My girlfriend and I went for dinner recently (recommendation - book in advance!) and enjoyed everything about La Musa. The food is great, with some really impressive and unusual small dishes - La Bomba and the wild boar dishes being worthy of mention - including for desserts. There are plenty of wines to choose from, and reasonably priced the are too - we had a lovely Malbec for around 16 euros. The decor is very cool - we were downstairs and the decorations on the walls, the tables and chairs, all have quite a trendy but unpretentious feel to them. The atmosphere is nice, too - it's clearly a popular choice for dinner on Saturday nights - we had to settle for an 'early' 9pm slot - with good music playing, not too loud, and a nice crowd in there. Finally, the service was really good. As with the best restaurant staff, our waitress was friendly and attentive but not overbearing. Her recommended dishes, too, were gratefully received.

When she knew I was going to Madrid she said I had to go there to see 'proper' flamenco. We booked online in advance and booked show and dinner €70.50 per head.  Our table was at the front, in fact less than a metre from the stage, so we were able to see all the footwork of the dancers.  The evening began with a huge dish of olives followed by the set meal - 'tapas' starters, paella and chocolate dessert. All alcohol was free - we started with sangria then two of us went onto red wine whilst our friend stuck with sangria.  The starters were typically Spanish. Croquettes (some chicken, some fish),tuna salad, a plate of cold meats (chorizo, Serrano ham, etc), tortilla, cheeses and bread. Calling them tapas is an insult, the helpings were very generous indeed.  The main course was paella, two of us had traditional paella, with prawns and chicken, another person had the vegetable option. Again delicious. The chocolate cake was scrumptious, definitely home made. Now to the entertainment - the flamenco performers change regularly so there is no danger of them being jaded or predictable. The group performed non stop for a full hour. The energy, commitment and passion has to be seen to be believed. Whatever your thoughts on flamenco dancing, go and experience it.

This is a dinner show, we were a tour group so we didn't have choices from a menu. We were served Paella, some vegetables and a dessert. The show started about an hour after. The place is rather small, which gives everyone a good view. There is a raised stage, where the performers are. I also love Spanish guitar, and we were fortunate to hear some of that as well. But the Dancers, when they walked out in the colorful costumes, the women with the slick backed buns and the flowers in their hair, with beautiful shawls and fans. The men in the tight black pants, it gave me goosebumps. I have waited so long to be able to see this. The dancing was breath taking, the passion and the speed. Their feet never still. I absolutely loved it. I would not hesitate to recommend to everyone to see a Flamenco show while in Spain. It was most enjoyable, entertaining, and the talent was awesome. As I said, my three male companions also enjoyed it very much..

The waitstaff is extremely attentive and they have an English menu which is always a plus. Even though he's never had it before, my husband tried the squid because it came highly recommended by the waiter. I had the lamb. Both were very good.

Located in a cute square in the old town district of the city - outside seating if the weather is nice allows you to really soak up the European culture. Inside is great and very nicely decorated. Chic, on trend and a great spot to spend an hour or two. Service is wonderful and all the staff are great and speak at least English (as well as Spanish) and some are fluent in French and German as well. The food is incredible and great for a lunch or lighter dinner. The style is tapas, but not traditional in the sense of what you will find everywhere else in Spain. This is more of a modern twist and it is delicious.

It is a laid back casual place to go out to eat with your friends at an affordable price.This place has a New York theme thus the burgers are named after places in New York such as SOHO, WILLIAMSBURG, HARLEM, etc.  My friends and I came across this place during our time in Madrid, it offers beers at a reasonable price. I loved their mozzarella sticks and their fries. The service is very laid back so do not expect your waitress to check up on you often. The one thing that was very interesting about the service that Ive never experienced before is that when your food arrives the waitress asks you to check if the meat is cooked to your preference before she walks away.

I was completely floored though by our experience here. We did the paella dinner followed by the flamenco show and I honestly kept my expectations very low because I just figured that the food would be rubbish - I could not have been more wrong! The meal started off with a delicious salad followed by what, to me, was an endless supply of tapas! I was expecting the salad, but the tapas was a nice surprise of croquettes, cheese, Iberic jamon, other meats and a few other delicacies. I was already full at this point, but then they brought out the paella which was to die for. If that was not enough, they offered two dessert choices: what appeared to be a carrot cake and chocolate cake, both of which were delicious. That was just the food!!! I was already in gay spirits because the food was so good, but then the four flamenco dancers and the band took the stage. Those dancers had so much passion and vigor that I too wanted to jump up and start dancing! Each one did about fifteen minutes making the show a little over an hour which was the perfect amount of time. Whether people consider this place a ""tourist trap"" or not, who cares??

So - it was very convenient but the food was also good. I don't even think they had the usual jamon and patatas bravas on the menu. So - it was tapas but with a pretty significant difference. They even have a guacamole you mash yourself on the menu. We ended up eating there twice and having a varied number of their tapas and were satisfied both times.  The weather was too cold to sit outside - but the interior was nice and the wait staff dressed up for Halloween on October 31st.

When we booked, the staff spoke great English, they were very helpful in explaining prices and options to us. When we turned up on the night, we were early and were told we could stay or come back in an hour as the first show was about to start and they didnt want us to have a spoilt evening by seeing the show too early. The stsaff said they would save us a great table as a result, and they definitely did. We were seated at a table right in front of the stage. The menu had several options, which when we ordered, were all very tasty, Good sized portions and great flavours. It was all you could drink on any drinks too which was a massive bonus.  The show itself was brilliant lasting around an hour. The energy was fabulous and the atmosphere superb. A highly recommended show and dinner.

Apparently the natives go to more genuine places where the prices are much lower. Not one of them recommended las Carboneras. I was left with the impresison that las Carboneras is a typical tourist trap. I know enough Spanish and about Spanish flamenco to notice that the performers were ""ad libbing"" as they went along. At one point one of the singers kept singing ""meow, meow, meow"" and the performers had a hard time hiding their smirks - probably thinking how naive the toruists must be to think this was serious art.

Tapas places are wall to wall in this area, but we loved this one, which was a bit different. You can sit outside in a pretty little square, but the decoration inside is very cool and modern - it has an amazing 'living wall' of moss and fern, and there's a Japanese feel to many of its dishes. I don't eat meat, so they customised their tapas for two for E30 with fish. This included the best tempura squid I've ever had. We liked it so much we went a second time and had lovely food again - including ""Chocolatissimo"", a small but perfectly formed dessert with a really intense chocolate hit.

It has tables outside facing “Plaza de la Paja” but we decided to eat inside. This restaurant had great atmosphere and lovely well decorated interior. Since we got a bit earlier, it was quiet but soon the atmosphere became lively with a trendy scene as people started to fill the restaurant. Then, we remembered that people in Spain eat later than in the US. It has a creative menu of unique salads and tapas. The tapas are a bit different than the traditional tapas but with tasty inventive variations. The menu is written in the form of a newspaper, with each 'article' giving different selections of food. We tried grilled garlic shrimp and “bomba” (a sliced potato filled with meat in a spinach sauce). The food and the ambiance made the occasion. If you like to discover special boutique restaurants, and If you're looking for something a little different, you need to look for this place. It is not far from Plaza Mayor (about 7 min walking distance), easy to find and worth the effort. It has reasonable prices and it was a wonderful experience. Highly recommended.

If I remember correctly, the menu is fairly similar (if not the same) for both restaurants. The tapas menu strives to be inventive, and it is, but often feels a bit lacking in cohesion as a result. We shared the tomato salad, the Croquetas 2.0, the eggplant hummus, and the charcoal grilled veggies. Everything was fine, but not mindblowing.

Both dishes went extremely perfectly with our bottle of wine (Muga from the La Rioja region). Service was excellent; there was one main server managing the small room, but she was super efficient!

Initially I was skeptical about the modern interiors and 90s RnB playing (we had a few older people dining with us) but the menu looked great so we dove in.

Someone who was eating there at the time recommended the Igueldo pincho. So we had it and OMG it was so good. It was squid on some ham and fish roe. You really have to try it! Only 4.90 euro So we decided to try some more. Ordered the Iberian Pen. 15.5 euro. Very soft and succulent pork on a bed of potatoes and some sweet sour sauce. Deliciouss Then we wanted more! So we ordered the Cheek glaze (said come with orange-but ours had no orange on top) but it was melt in your mouth dish!! This was 5.50 euro We also ordered the hamburger “unai” it’s basically meat burger covered in tempura and some mushroom and pepper cream sauce. This was also delicious and big for the price.

On the inside it is modern and industrial, and the outside terrace is in the middle of a picturesque square. The high tables near the wall (where we were seated) are not made for tall western europeans. A long metal rod was in the place where my knees wanted to be. We were unfortunately not reseated. The menu is not printed in english, only an online version was available. Flavor combinations of the tapas were interesting and new, but didn't always work. The restaurant was severely understaffed this evening, and as a result the service was very very slow. The table was too small for more than three tapas.

Particularly liked the tuna and tomatoes and the Mediterranean fried vegetables. House wine was good quality. Cost for two with a couple of glasses each just on 70€.

I was on the lookout for traditional Spanish restaurants and I am delighted to have visited El Neru based on the reviews on TA!  I am now in Barcelona, and can't stop thinking about the meal I had in El Neru. When I arrived at the restaurant at about 1pm, the bar was crowded with local people having their beer and tapas. I had to jostle past them to get to the restaurant which was accessed by a downward flight of stairs which led to a cavernous underground seating area. The walls of the restaurant were filled with photos of people who have eaten there, and I could tell it was an established restaurant which was well-loved by many.  My partner and I ordered a set meal consisting of clams in beans + tuna in tomato sauce, and on top of that, we ordered a beef stew and baked hake (basque style). I loved every dish that came (except the tuna; not because it was not well done, but I realise I'm not a fan of the fish). From the taste, I could tell that a lot of effort has been put into preparing the stock and sauces for the dishes. Each dish was extremely tasty and had depth.  For the dishes, we paid about 60e, very reasonable for the amazing food quality. If you are looking for a traditional restaurant to visit, you MUST visit El Neru.

(Between Calle Arenal and Calle Mayor, near Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol.) Walk right past the crowded tapas bar downstairs to the charming multi-room restaurant with wood beams and attractive murals. The lunch crowd (2 pm onward in Madrid) is all Spanish speaking and the service was excellent. But the food was what made this an outstanding find. Try the warm alcachofas (artichokes in oil and a touch of garlic) as a first course instead of a salad. The fabada asturiana, an Asturian specialty dish of large beans with a chunk of bacon, a pork sausage and a blood sausage (like a Spanish version of a French cassolet) was excellent as was the solomillo, a thick chunk of sirloin served on a sizzling platter.

It is bar far my favourite place to go for a snack in Madrid. I have been coming here for years but until now I have selfishly not disclosed its existence to anyone else but my best friends. I like it as it is – you seldom see tourists there. The first impression is that it is tiny. Indeed the bar area is very narrow. There is seating at the back. El Ñeru is Asturias transported to Madrid. The favourite tipple here is Asturian cider. If you do not like cider, think again. There is cider and there is Asturian cider. It is wonderful. If you are an Astu-rian you will want to drink your cider the traditional way. This requires great skills, the type of skill that only comes with a great deal of practice. Asturians like to hold the bottle of cider way up over their heads and pour it into a glass held low in the other hand. This is impossible for normal mortals who would invariably miss by a mile. For the Asturian I suspect it is a matter of declaring one’s unique identity. For the outsider it is hugely entertaining to watch them. The object of all of this is to aerate the cider so as to enhance the taste. For less mortals the bar provides a clever little electrically driven dispenser for your cider. You press the button and aerated cider sprays into your glass. Very high tech!  If this wasn’t enough to send you running to visit El Ñeru there is more. If you order anything in the bar it comes with a very generous tapa. You can have chorizo, Asturian blue cheese on bread, or tortilla. If you simply order a glass or cider at €1 and then repeat the order you will soon find that the tapas have left you no room for your dinner. The waiters are terrific. They are efficient and have a great sense of humour. If you leave a tip they clang a cow bell. For more formal eating there is a very Spanish menu. It includes typical Madrid favourites such as tripe. There is a large selection of meat, fish and vegetable dishes. My favourite is fabada Asturiana, Asturian pork and beans. For the quality, I think that the menu is ridiculously cheap. There is also a menu of the day. Please don’t go there when I am visiting. I like to be the only foreigner.

(That is, if you like Spanish food) Even just the white tuna/bell pepper salad was delicious, and they served us sidra in perfect Spanish style. Meaning the waiter had to pour it over his head into a glass in his hand. It's supposed to splash and hit the brim each time it's poured, they did it perfectly and it was delicious. The wine was lovely, service fantastic (especially as my host was a frequent guest). I had a frozen whisky tart for desert which was simply to die for.

The atmosphere was great. We ordered a selection of items. The avocado in tempura batter is delicious as is the Calamari. We had a lovely evening and will definitely return.

Location is great, between calle Arenal and Plaza Mayor, so, if you're in for holidays in the city, it's a good place to go. The waiter would scream something like ""Tapa X para celiacos"", we knew for sure it was for us. Try the ""toritlla de patatas"" and ""chopitos"" (fried baby Squid).

It was a little intimidating at first because our Spanish is fairly poor and it was pretty obvious that this bar was not tailored for English speaking tourists. However, as soon as we found a place at the bar and ordered our first cerveza and cider (which was accompanied with possibly the best tortilla we've ever had and complimentary with the drinks) we knew we had lucked out in a big way. We were the only English speakers in the crowded little bar, but the waiters were very friendly, and patient enough with our Spanish, that we felt very welcome. I would definitely recommend ordering a glass of cider. They are known for it, and it was unlike any we've had before (in the best way possible). The chipirones were wonderfully flavorful a and delicious as well.

It's owned by a qualified hotelier and someone who has produced an amazing restaurant. It's always very busy so make sure you are prepared to wait for a table. The dining area is typically Spanish, very small & cosy, quaint, very little space and packed with people. The place really has a good vibe. The service is typical Spanish as you would get in any tapeteria in Madrid, a very little bit slow but charming. The bar is always packed and you can enjoy a few sparkling wines or beers while waiting for your table. You can even eat at the bar if you wish to. The food is spectacular, reasonably priced and very very well presented. It's fine dining tapas. This place doesn't produce the normal tapas you would get at any tapeteria, he prepares high end tapas and it is exquisite. Dishes such as foie gras on brioche, secreto iberico, outstanding cuts of seared beef and a wide variety of seafoods prepared and produced in a unique fine dining manner, to include a lucsiously rich dark molten chocolate cake. Please note that the menu is in Spanish and the serving staff do not speak English so be prepared. As long as you got a little travel book of food terms, you will generally know what to order. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed. It is so worth it, you just have to go. We were lucky as we had our friends there with us who are Spanish and from Madrid. My favourite was the Secreto Iberico, which I believe is the secret cut of pork from the leg or neck of the Iberian black pig, marinated, seared and served with a dark sauce ... it was the best pork I have ever eaten in my life (apart from wild boar).

It's also one of the few places which -- and maybe some people will disagree -- serves rather more in the English-Spanish style, ie, where you can have a variety of smaller, less expensive dishes rather than just full-on raciones. I wouldn't say it's amazing, just good -- of the kind of standard that one expects in London. That said there's a simple salad of rocket, warm goat's cheese, skinned, roasted red peppers and toasted walnuts that is excellent, and we enjoyed, too, an avocado salad topped with prawns, though there shouldn't have been any need really to deliver it at 2C, it could have been brought to room temperature, which is always better for avocado.

We arrived at 8.30, preposterously early by Madrid standards, and it was wholly empty. Didn’t bother us; we could pull tables together and make ourselves comfortable. The name of the place suggests Basque influence, and the fact that the little starters are called pintxos rather than tapas confirms it. The tortilla was very good, moist inside, a far cry from the rather dry wodges of egg and potato one gets used to. Otherwise we had a couple of plates of bacalao en tempura with caramelised onion, some foie gras, and an odd skewer of what turned out to be fish in a sauce the colour of pale green emulsion. Some of us ate beef ternera, chunks of dark meat in a sherry gravy with potato puree, far more meat than veg, this being Spain, while others had something in the pork line archly called secret iberico. Bottles of Rioja with this. By the time we left the small dining-room had filled and the bar was busy enough for us to have to shove our way through. Crowded; cheerful; indifferent décor.

We were the only people in the restaurant and no one else came in after we arrived. Our friends had been on numerous occasions and were surprised at the poor quality of the food. None of the dishes we ordered were any good at all, and seemed to have the same flavour,, as if they had used the same base as a sauce. both the black lasagne and the meat was served on mashed potato made from a packet. The meat dish (carrillera), which my friends usually raved about was tough, unlike any other time they had had it there. The mango and smoked fish salad was laden with mayonnaise and another sauce that had used on the risotto with cuttlefish, which was very poor. They told the waitress to tell the cook they were dissatisfied but she made no comment and in fact took on a rather surly attitude from then on. Eventually one of my friends asked to see the cook and we discovered that she was not Basque but from Eastern Europe. She was haughty and told us that everything was perfectly fine and that obviously if we had eaten it there couldn't be much to complain about. The truth is that we ate the food because we were all starving after a long day's work and couldn't face leaving and looking for somewhere else. After hearing what she had to say, we cancelled the dessert order and paid without leaving a tip. I would strongly advise you to keep away from this place.",2013-08-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1023935-Reviews-or80-Txirimiri-Madrid.html,UID_46982,0.07,0.84,0.09,0.7994,-0.0400277777777777,0.5210833333333333,0.4738083333333333,1466,149,0.1016371077762619,0,25,False,51,0.0789473684210526,0.0789473684210526,0.1842105263157894,0.0526315789473684,0.1842105263157894,0.0789473684210526,0.0263157894736842,0.0263157894736842,0.2105263157894736,0.0789473684210526,274,167,4.354014598540146,0,0,last might friend took us dinner txirimiri locat gener diaz porlier peopl restaur one els came arriv friend numer occas surpris poor qualiti food none dish order good seem flavour use base sauc black lasagn meat serv mash potato made packet meat dish carrillera friend usual rave tough unlik time mango smoke fish salad laden mayonnais anoth sauc use risotto cuttlefish poor told waitress tell cook dissatisfi made comment fact took rather surli attitud eventu one friend ask see cook discov basqu eastern europ haughti told us everyth perfectli fine obvious eaten much complain truth ate food starv long day work face leav look somewher els hear say cancel dessert order paid without leav tip would strongli advis keep away place,very bad review,1,Mexican

The place had a nice cosy atmosphere and it really looked like a family-owned business. You could have lunch at some tables or at the counter. Because I was alone I opted for the counter. Plates and cutlery are already set and you just sit in. They offer a mostly typical Spanish menu with two dishes, one drink, bread and dessert for around 10€.  The food was quite average. I had the risotto and tuna with tomato sauce.  You can tell the dishes are not only cooked but already plated by the almost no time it takes to order and get served (best part about the place). I didn't know that, otherwise I would have never ordered a risotto, obviously...  The tomato sauce with the tuna was quite sweet and the tuna was definitely not fresh (frozen perhaps, or just overcooked...).  Apparently they are really good on desserts but I had too much sweet with the tomato sauce so I went for the coffee.  I had read a couple of reviews and was expecting a nice little place (which it was) where you could have some home cooked meals but I was a bit (very...) disappointed with the food.  I guess around Fuencarral you can find better value for your money. But if you are in a hurry this might be the best option (I'm quite sure they must be faster than some fast food places).

The place is half a block from Calle Mayor as you walk down towards Arenal on the left side of the street. Anything you order will satisfy your palate but their fabada is as genuine as it gets. Make sure you wash it down with some sidra. Personally I like both types, the sweet and the dry and feel either one will go with a good fabada although the dry one is perhaps more appropriate because it tends to have a lighter flavor to conbtrast with the heaviness of the dish. You don't have to sit down and have a meal in order to enjoy el Neru.

We had gluten free bread and ordered a gluten free beer. We even had squid in a gluten free batter . The waiter we had could not have been more helpful but it was early in the evening and we were the first people in the dining area. We also had a feel for what would be gluten free on the menu so stuck to asking about those dishes . It is a shame that the other group found their waiter so unhelpful . I would advise anyone trying this restaurant to have some knowledge of Spanish as it was not always easy to communicate and the GF food is not as easy to identify as the restaurant front window suggests .Also it is not open on Monday or Tuesday evenings in July. If you are a newly diagnosed coeliac and not yet fully sure of what to avoid and what foods may present a risk I probably would advise you not visit this place .,2014-07-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d804606-Reviews-or60-El_Neru-Madrid.html,UID_47001,0.102,0.817,0.081,-0.7823,0.2271263774104683,0.5122015610651975,0.2324625,1063,104,0.0978363123236124,0,12,False,47,0.0638297872340425,0.1489361702127659,0.2978723404255319,0.0425531914893617,0.2127659574468085,0.0212765957446808,0.0212765957446808,0.0851063829787234,0.0851063829787234,0.0212765957446808,207,123,4.140096618357488,0,0,seen anoth group problem gluten free option restaur good experi despit us speak littl spanish waiter littl english waiter point safe eat gluten free bread order gluten free beer even squid gluten free batter waiter could help earli even first peopl dine area also feel would gluten free menu stuck ask dish shame group found waiter unhelp would advis anyon tri restaur knowledg spanish alway easi commun gf food easi identifi restaur front window suggest also open monday tuesday even juli newli diagnos coeliac yet fulli sure avoid food may present risk probabl would advis visit place,good review,4,Spanish

We opted for two of the €30 degustation menu (recommended for 2 people) between four of us. We also ordered drinks. The first 4 dishes (cold tapas) came out quickly and we ate them. 20 minutes after we finished eating then though, we hadn't been checked on and our plates hadn't been cleared. We finally got the attention of our waitor and he gestured at us ""I'll be right there"". Another 5-10 minutes and he cleared our plates. 15 minutes later the four hot tapas arrived. We ate them and by this stage we were getting very peeved with the lack of service. A waitor tried to take a half-full smoothie from our table but our waitor didn't come to clear our plates for another 15 minutes after we finished. As soon as he cleared the plates, we asked for the dessert tapas and the bill to come at the same time. The desserts finally arrived but the bill didn't. We got the bill and went up to pay because we couldn't be bothered to wait (they do split bills which is a positive). A dinner of tapas took 2 hours. I understand that service is Europe is slower and more relaxed but this was ridiculous. It was a Thursday night and whilst the restaurant was buzzing, it definitely wasn't too busy. The only thing that managed to redeem them was the food and reasonable price of drinks. Food was great and so was the sangria. We left very full from the tasting menu, and €30 each for a meal including dessert is great However if you are looking for good service and a normal-length dinner, go elsewhere.

We arrived at the the place around 8:00 p.m. and were led to a table. When we asked the waiter for a gluten-free menu he said in an abrupt, unfriendly way that they do not have gluten-free food there! There was no communication problem as we speak fluent Spanish.

We were seated immediately even though people were waiting - big plus. Unfortunately the back of the restaurant was very noisy and we were given no attention for like 20-30 mins...very frustrating.

We chose the Menú del Día which was a bit more expensive than other restaurants nearby. Our experience was not that of having tapas or the ham for which the Cinco Jotas is known, but the Menú. Service was very efficient and attentive. Portions, although not huge, were fine, and the different plates were presented in a beautifully modern way. The dishes had a slight zing of brightness to them which made the dining experience different from most of the traditional Spanish restaurants where we had previously eaten. I especially remember the salad that I selected from the Menú. The strong balsamic vinegar laced along the rim of the bowl allowed the diner to bring it into the greens. We were pleased with our meals and would recommend the restaurant to others.",2015-11-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d991586-Reviews-or60-Cinco_Jotas_Jorge_Juan-Madrid.html,UID_1941,0.024,0.832,0.144,0.9731,0.1245833333333333,0.5395833333333332,0.2669875,901,85,0.0943396226415094,0,13,False,28,0.0714285714285714,0.0714285714285714,0.5714285714285714,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,158,108,4.708860759493671,0,0,fortun get tabl midday week restaur frequent profession worker area chose men del bit expens restaur nearbi experi tapa ham cinco jota known men servic effici attent portion although huge fine differ plate present beauti modern way dish slight zing bright made dine experi differ tradit spanish restaur previous eaten especi rememb salad select men strong balsam vinegar lace along rim bowl allow diner bring green pleas meal would recommend restaur other,good review,4,Spanish

We found it at La Gaditana and we are very happy once again. We really prefer the traditional small bar/restaurants that you can find in Spain over the new style tapas types of restaurants. La Gadatina is a true gem for Spaniards and tourists alike who know what fine dining is supposed to be about: Quality food at reasonable prices with friendly smiles and helpful tips.  We ate here with my kids and their mother late one night for our first memorable occasion when we found a couple of square feet of unoccupied space between the bar and the back room door. The place was packed wall to wall for a birthday party and everyone had a blast. I went back again with the kids for a little snack which turned out to be a full course meal once again. It is such an incredible pleasure to have to fight with my 6 year old daughter and 12 year old son over who gets to eat more chopitos (do not confuse this with chupitos... I was offered a chupito after eating all the chopitos), fried shark, crunchy shrimp pancakes, croquetas de jamon and calamari. The fried eggplant slivers we also a real treat.

We found the best possible sun trap on a corner table at the Cinco Jotas. They welcomed us in a cool and warm way, and they brought us the menu and some nibbles. We chose an Ensalada Rusa, the stone cooked beef steak for 2 persons a simple tomato and garlic salad and a bottle of red wine. Everything was lovely but when The meat arrived we could not believe what we were tasting. The most tender and soft and juicy and tasty meat ever! The meat was half cooked on the stone and continued cooking in front of us, served with French fries, coarse sea salt and mustard. I have no words to describe the delicious taste of the meat.

We were 5 people from our team, who wanted to eat like the locals do, which is not so easy to find in the center of a big city... This place offered a very good and quick service, we tried many different tapas together and they were all great; Good choice for vegetarians, good red wine from the open bottle, great seafood, the only downturn was a forgotten beer, that was then pulled very fast and not well. Apart from that we did not see any tourists, which we found a great plus, the place is decorated in the very local style and is a bit darkish, so you must like this. The price we paid was really worth it, so if you are looking for a tapas dinner the way the local spend their evening, this is definitely a place to consider.

I've tried the one in Rambla Catalunya in Barcelona, which was quite good, but the Jorge Juan restaurant was a better experience for some reason. The jamón ibérico was of superior quality in both, but I found the Barcelona branch was more of a tapas place (and very good at that, too), in a modern setting, whereas Jorge Juan has more of a bistro feel, with a cozier setting.

With its glass front and ceiling, and its wooden panels and floors, and spacious proportions, the restaurant has a bright airy feel to it. The low-volume jazz playing in the background enhanced the calm and relaxed atmosphere of the place. The restaurant is part of a chain designed to promote the brand Cinco Jotas jamon iberico, from the black pig which is indigenous to the Spanish south-west and that feeds principally on acorns for its diet. The plate of jamon we shared as an appetizer was outstanding. For main dishes, two of us had the tataki de presa, a pork filet very lightly braised on the outside and pink on the inside. Very tender and juicy. The third person in our party had a steak, which was also done perfectly. The accompanying vegetables were appropriately done but nothing inspiring. We didn't stay for desserts or coffees.

This was our last stop in Europe and also happened to be our anniversary. For starters, try the local cider, it's an experience you won't want to miss (a bucket, on the ground to catch overflow, is involved :-). I ordered the goat cheese salad as a starter and I'm still dreaming about it, I have no idea how they managed to ""encrust"" it similar to creme brûlée. SO delicious! I ordered the fish of the day and my husband had the steak, both were out-of-this world amazing!! Despite the language barrier (our limited Spanish and their limited English) we managed to order everything we wanted.

I called and was able to get a table easily (a positive part of Covid). I was a little bit skeptical but left with an excellent impression. The restaurant is quite big with different dining rooms (all of them are charming). I love the blue decor and everything was beautifully set. I was hesitating as between the Pedreiro Roasted Octopus and the razor clams as a starter and the waitress kindly offered me to have a half-portion of each (though it was not indicated in the menu). That was a great suggestion. The razor clams were a pure delight. I then had the candied suckling pig with mashed apple and this was really delicious and the portion generous. After this, I was full but still wanted some sweets to end up my lunch and I opted for a passion fruit sorbet, which was an excellent choice. The service was very professional, the staff was friendly and attentive to the clientele.They have great Laguiole knives which is a sign of very good quality.

Lomo de Buey was very good with a lovely and intense wooden scent. Price was a bit off charts especially taking into account that all the main dishes costed about the same and some were fulfilling while others were very small (the Rabo de Toro dish is basically a 27€ tapa).

Friends treated us for dinner, apparently they love it here. Expensive, everyone is on ‘speed mode’ and although most of the dishes we ordered were good, nothing out if this world, one dish ‘pheasant fried rice’ was so salty it was like a spoon full of salt in every bite. Didn’t want to make a fuss since our friends are locals and although we have found any rice dishes here in Spain tend to be saltier anyway but this fried rice was pretty salty. Not sure what is the fuss about since the food was good but definitely not so good that we would be back.

My wife and I found Monty's here on trip advisor... It was a bit out of our way, but we're glad we made the trek. Mi español no es bueno, but with the help of our waiter (and Google Translate) we made it work.  This is easily 2 steps above bar tapas. We ordered these delicious fried goat cheese balls to start. Fantastic! (They served us 5, I ate the first one before I thought to take pictures. Lo siento!) Our mojitos were delicious. I ordered the Argentinian steak with truffled mashed potatoes. My wife had the pulled pork burger (our waiter, Manuel, used his limited English to make sure we understood this was pork not beef. Very helpful!) The pulled pork had some delicious fried queso and a side of fries (chips to ye Brits) Those of you who know me know that I am a steak lover. This steak was probably in the top 5 of my life. A beautiful piece of hanger steak, perfectly salted, you can taste the smoke from the grill. And the chef hit a proper medium. Brilliant. The prices were extremely reasonable for what we were served. Steak was under 10 Euros. In Massachusetts, that's a $25 plate all day long. Our whole bill, 2 drinks, an appetizer and 2 meals was less than 40 Euros.  At the end of the meal, we managed to put together enough Spanish to ask for a cab. Another waiter came over, and explained in perfect English how we could catch one on the street, what the green light means, etc.  Our experience at Monty's was a solid 5 stars! Cinco estrellas!

At the end they refused to bring more wine to the table, said we had to go to a crappy room at the back where they were showing the champions league if we wanted more drinks. They said they were closing the restaurant. We went for a drink next door after the match finished and when walking past Larumbe on our way to the taxi rank 1.5hrs later, there were four people still sitting at a table chatting away - and having drinks.
