For 21 EUR per person we have shared four tapas and had two large beers each. Meat tapas are grilled with grainy salt and taste a bit like byte-sized Brazilian churrascas and come with a great sauce on the side. The service in English is adequate, and we have enjoyed our dinner. The beer was not as cold as we would have liked.

It was very easy to reserve a table via trip advisor. I would recommend that you do book a table as it is a popular place, which isn't a surprise! The service we had from our waiter Jose was excellent - very friendly and attentive. All other staff we spoke to were also very good. It is the kind of place where they will not pass your table without checking whether there are plates to clear or to make sure you have a drink. The food was simply amazing! Authentic Spanish tapas at a very reasonable price and everything was delicious. We had a selection of tapas and desserts and enjoyed it all. The cava and cerveza were both excellent too. We ate at a number of places during our visit to Madrid, and although all were good, this was by far the best.

If you try the ham and cheese crocettes you will be off to a great start, but leave room for dessert because your waiter may suggest a cheesecake flavoured with toffee and mango which is utterly heavenly.

Excellent food, ambience, and service! What made it such an exceptional experience was the warm and friendly service by all the guys (Sadly I only got the name of one the bartenders - Jose, who was awesomely friendly and nice) here. We arrived in Madrid on a Friday and had dinner here. We were seated at the bar and initially hoped that we could move to a table. However, we soon realized that the bar seats were the best spot! We could see the bartenders work their magic and chat with them, even free shots! When we asked one of the guys to take a photo for us, they all joined in for a group selfie. The awesome food and warmth felt made us decide that we would come back the next 2 nights (basically our entire stay in Madrid). When they heard it was our last night in town (on Sunday), they had to make it a memorable one. Jose had a round of shots with us and even gave us a delicious Three-Milk cake!! We also had free wine from the owner and gummies to pair it with! When we thought we were done, Jose offered us bread with pulled beef on top which was awesomely good. We left with a full tummy and heart. Most importantly, we arrived as strangers but left as friends. Thanks much guys (the owner, all the guys, and especially Jose)!

Every course (I did the full tasting menu) was perfectly presented, perfectly executed, perfectly balanced, and a feast for the eyes. And the taste of each was unique and a delight for the senses.

Our Spanish is a bit rusty, but with the help of our able waiter Ricardo (who spoke about the same amount of English as we did Spanish) who showed us photos of each dish from his cellphone, we were able to figure out what we wanted.  Among other dishes, the grilled octopus in a Teriyaki style sauce with avocado and thinly fried potato confetti was the hit of the night. The potato and onion tortilla espanola was also very good, as was the burrata with sun dried tomatoes and the mozzarella and eggplant tower.  Our server was extremely attentive and very helpful. The wines were inexpensive and quite good. All in all, the food was a huge hit and the service even better.

We didn’t know what to expect because the restaurant does not have the most typical dishes but it’s much much better than that. Every dish we ordered surprised us even more. My favorite was the shrimp dish in a kind of shell. The taste from the fish/meat with combination of the different kind of sauces are so nice. I would really recommend this place but make a reservation before because it’s very populair. We were very lucky to have seats even when we didn’t make a reservation they did everything to help us get a seat. There drinks are also very good and they have a lot of different kinds of cocktails which are very tasty. I think they even invented some of them their selfs. I think this whole restaurant is very impressive the food the service and the whole atmosphere. Especially because the restaurant is placed in a street which you wouldn’t usually. My credits go to the enthusiasm of our waiter Nico he was very happy en friendly en got us even take a desert (which we didn’t regret). I hope you guys are lucky as well to get served by nico even if I think al the other waiters were very friendly en hardworking as well. And last the prices are very good especially if you think of the value for money you will get.

We ate the classico menu, which offers a tour of the chefs favorite dishes. I dined at a lot of michelin starred restaurants across Spain, but Cebo ranks amongst my favorites. Imagative creative dishes, with a lot of flavour. The wine pairings are incredible and each course expresses traditional flavours with modern techniques. The beef and the anchovy are my favorites in this grand tour of flavours. Staff is attentive and has a good command of the English language. The only remark I have is that due to an allergy, the aspargues were left out in my dessert rather than replaced with something different. Looking forward to revisit this restaurant.

This place is amazing. A great vibe. Silent B&W movies playing on wall over kitchen. Bartenders more like mad scientists. And a menu to die for if you’ve been - like me - eating fun but very traditional Spanish dishes for a while. InClan Brutal is an oasis of foodie modernity in a very traditional food area. It’s on a small side street. Better to keep it there because if it were on a main street I’d never have gotten near a stool at the front bar (which is more like sitting at a sushi bar except rather than watching them make sushi, you’re watching them concoct drinks). I’ll be going back until I’ve tried all the dishes. Also the smooth gazpacho in a cocktail glass was fun. And delicious. Last but not least, Francisco was ON IT. Great waiter!

Although it is a large food offering, we were surprised to be able to finish it. So the quantity and pacing of the dishes were spot on. As each Spanish regions has its own specificity, the tastes can vary from one dish to the other, but the pacing is made in such a way that there are no too stark contrasts between consecutive dishes. The place opens at 20:30 sharp. The welcoming process is very courteous and professional. The tables are very large, especially since we were seated on a 4-top, despite being only two. One thing we noticed is that the lighting over the tables is made in such a way that there is no shadow hitting the table. This enables for the white table to reflect and make the table look very bright. Also, it means that the pictures you will take will look very good. There is a proper kitchen area located in the back, but if you are seated at one of the two tables closer to the entry, you will be able to admire the prep counter on which the prep and plating of some dishes are being made. The service was perfect from the moment we entered to the moment we left the building. The dishes were well explained. The pacing between them was also spot on, not having to wait too long nor being rushed . The sommelier was very good at choosing a bottle for us, as well as suggesting special wines by the glass on top of our bottle, to better pair some of the dishes. Perfect. At 110€ / person, we think we robbed them for such a great experience at such a relatively low price. This place definitely earned a place in our top-5 best restaurants ever. It also beats the San Sebastian over-hyped Arzak hands-down, for only a portion of the price. We strongly recommend this place as a definite must for any food-loving visitor to Madrid.",2019-04-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10428302-Reviews-or50-Cebo-Madrid.html,UID_1313,0.022,0.8,0.179,0.9971,0.249430894308943,0.5652555168408827,0.4361526315789473,1951,190,0.097385955920041,0,43,False,80,0.1454545454545454,0.1636363636363636,0.3272727272727272,0.0545454545454545,0.2545454545454545,0.0,0.0181818181818181,0.0,0.0363636363636363,0.0,363,204,4.377410468319559,0,0,proposit restaur scari stomach cours menu guid region spain offer typic aspect local food found although larg food offer surpris abl finish quantiti pace dish spot spanish region specif tast vari one dish pace made way stark contrast consecut dish place open sharp welcom process courteou profession tabl larg especi sinc seat top despit two one thing notic light tabl made way shadow hit tabl enabl white tabl reflect make tabl look bright also mean pictur take look good proper kitchen area locat back seat one two tabl closer entri abl admir prep counter prep plate dish made servic perfect moment enter moment left build dish well explain pace also spot wait long rush sommeli good choos bottl us well suggest special wine glass top bottl better pair dish perfect person think rob great experi rel low price place definit earn place top best restaur ever also beat san sebastian hype arzak hand portion price strongli recommend place definit must food love visitor madrid,very good review,5,Spanish

We opted for the Somos menu, which consisted of 7 savoury bites, 14 courses, and 7 sweet bites (so 28 experiences). The food was of a very high level, with interesting flavour profiles, lots of variation in textures and some fascinating combinations and techniques. The level of all courses was high, with two weaker courses (see below) and three very strong courses (at the level of 2 stars).  The first dish we didn't like as much as the others was the hake cheeks. The dish had a heavy focus on egg, which made the dish feel very heavy and a bit monotonous. The second dish was one of the fish dishes (we think the turbot pinotxo, the one with the rabbit). The dish was too salty, although that could have been a problem with our specific batch. The wine pairing also could have been slightly better; the classics menu had 6 wines, which means a lot of the 14 courses shared wine. Some wines did not pair well with some of their courses. The decor is fantastic and feels very high-end and hip. The wait staff is amazingly trained and very friendly. We had the bad luck of a fly ending up in our wine, and the wait staff noticed something was wrong, came to the table and immediately apologized and replaced the wine. Thanks to the wait staff for making the evening feel so smooth and special. The 2nd chef even came to all the tables to ask how everyone was enjoying the food. The most fun part (for us) was that we were allowed to keep the menu, so we know exactly what we ate. Overall, the experience was amazing. We would definitely recommend Cebo, it was one of our better Michelin experience. I have great hope to see them eventually obtain another star.",2019-04-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10428302-Reviews-or50-Cebo-Madrid.html,UID_6338,0.044,0.782,0.174,0.9929,0.250456462585034,0.4940503401360544,0.4012499999999999,1710,140,0.0818713450292397,0,48,False,75,0.1527777777777778,0.1666666666666666,0.2916666666666667,0.0555555555555555,0.1527777777777778,0.0138888888888888,0.0138888888888888,0.0277777777777777,0.0972222222222222,0.0277777777777777,313,189,4.463258785942492,0,0,cebo offer solid star michelin experi opt somo menu consist savouri bite cours sweet bite experi food high level interest flavour profil lot variat textur fascin combin techniqu level cours high two weaker cours see three strong cours level star first dish like much other hake cheek dish heavi focu egg made dish feel heavi bit monoton second dish one fish dish think turbot pinotxo one rabbit dish salti although could problem specif batch wine pair also could slightli better classic menu wine mean lot cours share wine wine pair well cours decor fantast feel high end hip wait staff amazingli train friendli bad luck fli end wine wait staff notic someth wrong came tabl immedi apolog replac wine thank wait staff make even feel smooth special nd chef even came tabl ask everyon enjoy food fun part us allow keep menu know exactli ate overal experi amaz would definit recommend cebo one better michelin experi great hope see eventu obtain anoth star,very good review,5,French

Dinner reservations were 1 month wait, lunch we had 5 seatings available the next day, same menu. We are very well traveled as a family and are more keen on variety and experience rather than exclusivity. The set menu was intriguing so we opted for the 17 courses for all 4 of us plus the mid-range wine list. It was on the feather edge of too much food even after pacing ourselves. It took all of three hours to get through the selections and we enjoyed both the taste and presentation of each one. The staff were helpful and polite and the service was excellent. Given how some restaurants can be intimidating to the point of absurdity I felt the staff here wanted to share the experience of this level of service and quality with anyone interested.

We reserved this one Michelin starred restaurant in advance because it was relatively close to our hotel, and it was positively rated by both Trip Advisor and Google. We checked out the menu beforehand and felt it was going to be a culinary experience, which it was.  Our first impression upon arriving inside was how nicely decorated and modern it was. We arrived early evening so we were able to be seated quickly and at a nice table. We should add that the menu is not ala carte and you may find it difficult if not possible to make exchanges or replacements. This was when our host/lead server proceeded to let us know the ""rules"" of the menu and restaurant. I'm somewhat expressing our impressions of the service for us here. Their menu is an evolving one and seasonal, so what we had may or certainly could be different from what others have now.  We selected the ""our classics"" menu without a wine pairing. I believe we could have selected the same menu with wines, and/or a slightly more expansive menu. Anyway, my wife asked if she could substitute one or two items, but was told ""no replacements"". That strikes us as unusual even for fine dining restaurants. Believe us, we have and did dine at much more elaborate establishments and never experienced this type of rigidity. Needless to say, our server's approach with us didn't sit well for us and influenced our experience negatively. Oh, on top of that, she was basically ""ill served"" to be in such a position. We did have other servers bring different items to our table, and they were more professional. That aside, the individual menu items were half very good and half not so good (there were 10 different servings on our classics menu). Regardless, all the items were beautifully presented. We specifically enjoyed the ""spring onion and strawberry"", anchovy, ""costa brava"" creamy rice (really delicious and creamy like a risotto), glazed beef (like short ribs), chocoratafia, and assorted petit fours for dessert (these were very creative and fun to play with). In addition, we did really enjoy our champagne and wine. However, we would not return due to the service experience. Our review would be lower except the food was that creative and tasty.",2019-02-27,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10428302-Reviews-or50-Cebo-Madrid.html,UID_810,0.044,0.812,0.144,0.9927,0.2126272246272246,0.5703011063011064,0.2835136363636363,2267,175,0.0771945302161446,0,68,False,78,0.1132075471698113,0.1698113207547169,0.320754716981132,0.0566037735849056,0.1509433962264151,0.0188679245283018,0.0188679245283018,0.0566037735849056,0.0566037735849056,0.0377358490566037,391,245,4.79539641943734,0,0,cebo locat insid hotel urban madrid reserv one michelin star restaur advanc rel close hotel posit rate trip advisor googl check menu beforehand felt go culinari experi first impress upon arriv insid nice decor modern arriv earli even abl seat quickli nice tabl add menu ala cart may find difficult possibl make exchang replac host lead server proceed let us know rule menu restaur somewhat express impress servic us menu evolv one season may certainli could differ other select classic menu without wine pair believ could select menu wine slightli expans menu anyway wife ask could substitut one two item told replac strike us unusu even fine dine restaur believ us dine much elabor establish never experienc type rigid needless say server approach us sit well us influenc experi neg oh top basic ill serv posit server bring differ item tabl profession asid individu menu item half good half good differ serv classic menu regardless item beauti present specif enjoy spring onion strawberri anchovi costa brava creami rice realli delici creami like risotto glaze beef like short rib chocoratafia assort petit four dessert creativ fun play addit realli enjoy champagn wine howev would return due servic experi review would lower except food creativ tasti,average review,3,French

Greeted by the manager and given a table near the show kitchen in the restaurant so both able to see the food being prepared. Went for the 10 course menu with pared Spanish wines, with each course and wine explained in detail. The food was amazing, and varied between one mouthful using your fingers to a small dish needing to be eaten in a specific order to appreciate the complexity of the dish. Also given 2 extra courses to help make the occasion more special and the desert decorated with happy birthday. All I can say is that this meal with live with me for a very long time, it was perfection. Some dishes had some strange aspects, with an anchovy ice cream but they all worked so well with each other. I come from a catering background so could appreciate the flavors, cooking styles and fusion of flavour’s. If you are going to Madrid then Cebo must be a place you must dine at.

It was in every way, except for the food (hence my score of 3 not 5).  The venue itself, inside the Urban Hotel, was elegant and definitely had the wow factor, employing the right use of lights to create mood and ambience. The staff really looked after us. The dishes were excellently presented, the plates were original, had different shapes, colours and materials to them, they were a delight to look at, nicely framing the bite-sizes sitting on top of them. But there is where it ended for me. Obviously the strawberry dessert looked stunning; however, taking a bite it tasted artificial. The cheese was contained in an edible membrane, I just did not enjoy it's texture. Nearly every dish had something quite not balanced about it, perhaps in an attempt to make its flavour memorable? It did not work on me, unfortunately and at €200 I wish it did. In my opinion, presentation and beauty, rather than being used to enhance the food, actually out-powered and overwhelmed it.

Some tastet in the direction of port and some even with a touch of whiskey) 3. And now to the food. Restaurant Cebo takes you on a trip around Spain - with 17 small and medium sized dishes from the differen regions of Spain and with a Theme going from the mountains to the sea. Its very delicious and very well prepared - except for few of the dishes that didn´t match the high level of the others. The egg-foam the spargues was a flop and also the last treat of small sweets fell through . this was a pitty as this dish should set a final point for this great experience. This is the reason I only give 4 stars - If you go to a high end restaurant with a michelin star you should expect all dishes to blow you away. But definately worth a visit.

Restaurant ambience is nice and elegant, tables are large and not to close to others, that is appreciated. Service very friendly but not always as attentive as you would expect in a Michelin restaurant (we had to wait quite a while before someone came to ask us what we wanted to drink) and the waitress did not speak very clearly. Interesting and extensive wine list, good recommendation from the sommelier. Presentation of the dishes was very beautiful, some dishes were very good, there is good quality, but others were just ok. The “pulpo, pulpit” – octopus- was very good, the rice “salmorreta” as well, “cococha de merluza con esparragos” (hake with asparagus) interesting. What I liked less were the two main dishes, especially I missed some real meat (just a very small piece of cochinito - pig), that I did not like that much. There were some interesting textures, but I am more interested in taste. It is a good restaurant, but I missed the “wow” factor that I expect in a Michelin restaurant and have experienced in other restaurants, I was hoping for dishes so good to remember for years.

But they were full so they sent us to this place. Probably the same owners.  It seems to me that it is all about image and money than taste and service.

The menu was, in my opinion, limited and somewhat confusing.. yes confusing even though we were given an English menu.  We ordered Sangria and Paella for two and a pork dish to share between the 4 of us. The sangria tasted watered down - the worst we have had so far, and we have had alot.  The bread took 35 minutes.  The paella took 45 minutes. To be fair we were warned that it would take 20 minutes. By comparison to the paella we had near plaza mayor, it cost 4 Euro more and had 50% or less calamari and shell fish. It was over cooked and tasted OK. The portion size was good... but it is pretty easy to make rice a big portion.  According to my wife, the pork was excellent, although a small portion  And we were basically kicked out at 21:00.

We don’t mind paying high price but do expect high quality. Let start with what we liked. 1. Service was superb, our waitress was attentive, smiling, and catered to our every wish.  2. Decor was superb if you like industrial, dark spaces. I do.  3. Dishes were imaginative, beautiful, and varied. We chose a fixed price menu for 85 ear per person of 12 small courses (way too much food) while they also have. 17 course meal.  So, with superb service, amazing ambience, and creative daring dishes..why only two stars for this Michelin rated restaurant? It just wasn’t tasty. My wife and I had 12 courses (actually ate 14 or 15 different things); and found only about a third of them to be tasty, and perhaps only two or three to be up to expectations. Other dishes (lemon cake dessert, anchovy ice cream course to name a few) were just horrible. The chef, clearly talented...and the Michelin reviewers...dropped the ball. Since when is style more important than substance. In the race to find ever more creative and daring dishes, you forgot about taste. Perhaps my palate is not sophisticated enough, perhaps I am less familiar with local cuisine....or perhaps the chef is so much of a celebrity that nobody is daring to say...The Emperor has No Clothes.  Good luck. That’s my two cents. Obviously I am in the minority among reviews, but that is my honest experience and review.",2019-10-03,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10428302-Reviews-or20-Cebo-Madrid.html,UID_14775,0.043,0.728,0.229,0.9967,0.2389393939393939,0.6154166666666666,0.6018,1539,108,0.0701754385964912,0,62,False,58,0.0821917808219178,0.1232876712328767,0.3698630136986301,0.0547945205479452,0.1506849315068493,0.0410958904109589,0.0547945205479452,0.0273972602739726,0.0684931506849315,0.0273972602739726,268,190,4.731343283582089,0,0,michelin rate restaur first timer much want blown away famou chef instead end mildli enjoy highli price meal mind pay high price expect high qualiti let start like servic superb waitress attent smile cater everi wish decor superb like industri dark space dish imagin beauti vari chose fix price menu ear per person small cours way much food also cours meal superb servic amaz ambienc creativ dare dish two star michelin rate restaur tasti wife cours actual ate differ thing found third tasti perhap two three expect dish lemon cake dessert anchovi ice cream cours name horribl chef clearli talent michelin review drop ball sinc style import substanc race find ever creativ dare dish forgot tast perhap palat sophist enough perhap less familiar local cuisin perhap chef much celebr nobodi dare say emperor cloth good luck two cent obvious minor among review honest experi review,average review,3,French

Place is beautiful tucked inside a hotel, greetings is so warm as you walk in, an open kitchen was to the right & just seeing the chefs working on those morsels has already excited my palette!  I knew I was in for a good experience! And yes it was! Having been to various other Michelin restaurants in Spain, this was one of our favorites.  Service definitely excelled here! Five stars! Wine pairing was beyond superb .  Food here was incredible. You get a little bigger piece here than you would at other Michelin restaurants. Portions were generous. Price was reasonable. What else can I ask for?  All I can say is you won’t regret.  The only one thing here I would like is for the menu not to be presented beforehand. I like the idea of a surprise in each dish. Here you get to see everything you get for the nite. Not a usual practice in Michelin restaurants. But other than that, everything was flawless. It was the best meal in Madrid !

Menu appeared to be based on the current culinary obsession with umami, with a heavy dose of 'past prime', attempting funk in every dish. The chef has a fascination with delivering the 'surprise' of an unpierced egg yolk that burst in the mouth, which appeared in at least two dishes and was revolting in the context of the unbalanced heaviness of the food. There was also zero balance in the range of ingredients presented, almost no veg or fruit, all dishes brown in color, and an unpleasant, unending stream of heaviness and lack of flavor balance, evoking disgust. Three of the four of us had major indigestion, two up all night with uncomfortable sleep from the meal, and even I, never prone to indigestion, experienced some. The red wine suggested was poor quality, plonk grade, only the white was a high note, a lovely sauvignon blanc. Sorry, Cebo, but for the price and reputation, you have to deliver, and diners are seeking great flavors and delight, not pretentiousness.

On a bustling Saturday evening in Madrid we stepped off the street into the tranquil setting of Cebo. The restaurant was set for minimal convers which added to the sense of exclusivity surrounding the dinner.  The maitre de and the rest of the service team were attentive from the very start and throughout.  We opted for the Somos CEBO menu which consists of 16 courses over about 3 hours. Each course was completely different to the last and the menu offered creative approaches from savoury bites at the start to sweet bites at the end.  Our personal favourites were the rice with Shropshire cheese, the yolk pudding and caviar at the beginning and the truffle chocolate pie at the end.  The menu was paired with 9 wines, the majority coming from Spain and the sommelier guided us carefully through the selection.

We arrived at this restaurant, located in a top-of-the-market hotel where th rack rate on a room approaches $900, and were seated promptly at 8:30 pm--their opening hour, and the time of our reservation. Immediately impressive: the ambiance of classy modernist decor with light levels modest but not gloomy. A wait staff that performs like you're the only ones in the house. A slight aroma of burning wood in the air. My wife and I went for the classic menu, a series of tasting plates. Early on, it was clear that the vision of Chef Morales is to generate maximum umami, and to make each course as intense in that flavor if not more so. The only break from the intensity came with a cool ""sweet orchard"" salad near the end, fresh with flavors of strawberry and chocolate to enhance the greens. Our wine pairings were also exceptional. From an aethetic perspective, I would have preferred a few more breaks from the intensity of flavors in the rest of the menu--but I have to admire a chef who has a vision and who pulls it off so spectacularly.

Either way it is appropriate. Beautiful restuarant located alongside the Urban hotel- under same ownership. It is a sort of themed menu- 17 dishes that takes you around all of the regions in Spain in a sea , land and mountain theme. That adds interest for sure and really works. The dishes are very creative and made from top quality fresh ingredients . Presentation is excellent. Service is very efficient tho not rushed in any way. This food journey through Spain is priced at €120. Option of wine flight or personal selection from main menu- wine flight priced at either €120 or €85 for 9 or 7 different wines- mercifully not 17 to match the number of courses ! The former ends with a wonderful old vintage Pedro Ximenez . I had expected all wines to be Spanish but they do include 1 French and 1 Portuguese wine- the Somellier knows what he is doing and wines did give a perfect balance but my personal preference would be for all Spanish Wines to match the all Spanish food menu- a small point. Restaurant is Michelin 1 star and it is a very interesting and enjoyable culinary journey. Restaurant closed Sunday and Monday.

We chose the Somos menu along with wine pairings. The menu started with a lovely presentation of snacks, followed by several starters and rice dish all beautifully presented with delicious fresh ingredients. We then went in to a fish and meat course and multiple dessert options. The wine pairings were some of the most unique we have ever had. We were able to receive a copy of the menu and wine pairings for reference during the meal (although not needed with the fabulous descriptions from the staff) that were nice to take home with us. The service was wonderful, very accommodating, informative, and enthusiastic. The entire experience was upscale yet approachable and not at all stuffy!

On my second visit I was wondering had Chef Morales lost his touch, was everything really so bad? Thankfully the answer is NO, Yes the style and presentation is different from other areas of the world but isn't that what travelling is all about, the first time I went to Japan in the 1980's I hated Sushi and couldn't see it catching on in the western world!!. This restaurant has if anything improved since my last visit in March. The tasting menu still represents amazing value and a good percentage of the dishes have been changed from my last visit, this makes a pleasant change to some places which have the same menu from year to year.

The restaurant was recommended by the concierge at our hotel, and we agreed to go based on the favorable reviews. As a background, I have been a wine collector for 25+ years, with an adventurous palate, and have traveled extensively and dined at various Michelin rated restaurants in the US, Europe and Asia. Unfortunately, only 2 individuals in our group of 8 could finish their meals. From appetizers through dessert, the composition of this food is simply not working. There is no doubt that a lot of effort was spent putting the dishes together. However, all the presentation and technique in this world will not succeed, if the food does not satisfy the palate, and sadly, that was our experience. To cap off dinner, we decided to take one more risk by ordering coffee and dessert. Our capuccinos were served cold, and the one (1) creme brulee ordered was unfinished between 8 diners. On the positive side, the service was very attentive, and we were repeatedly questioned regarding our satisfaction, to which we politely replied approvingly. It was obvious however, that the majority of dishes were removed with food that was not consumed. The chef did make an appearance and questioned where we were from, stating that perhaps we did not understand this kind of food, but that it was very fashionable in Spain. I held my tongue to avoid a pointless argument, but at the end, so many in our company were offended by the remarks, that I did mention it to the head waiter. Unbeknownst to the chef, I have visited Spain 15+ times and am very familiar with the Catalan and Basque schools of vanguard cuisine. However, food must primarily appeal to the tastebuds, and if customers cannot ""understand"" a chef's cuisine they will not return or recommend the establishment, as we have chosen to do. Lastly, I would like to point out, that cost considerations were not a factor in writing this review.",2017-07-13,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10428302-Reviews-or200-Cebo-Madrid.html,UID_14836,0.074,0.883,0.043,-0.8466,0.0447623966942148,0.6008756395120032,0.5715799999999999,1981,177,0.0893488137304391,0,53,False,44,0.0769230769230769,0.1282051282051282,0.2948717948717949,0.0256410256410256,0.2051282051282051,0.0256410256410256,0.0,0.0384615384615384,0.141025641025641,0.0641025641025641,344,213,4.761627906976744,0,0,last dinner week vacat sadli worst meal restaur recommend concierg hotel agre go base favor review background wine collector year adventur palat travel extens dine variou michelin rate restaur us europ asia unfortun individu group could finish meal appet dessert composit food simpli work doubt lot effort spent put dish togeth howev present techniqu world succeed food satisfi palat sadli experi cap dinner decid take one risk order coffe dessert capuccino serv cold one creme brule order unfinish diner posit side servic attent repeatedli question regard satisfact polit repli approvingli obviou howev major dish remov food consum chef make appear question state perhap understand kind food fashion spain held tongu avoid pointless argument end mani compani offend remark mention head waiter unbeknownst chef visit spain time familiar catalan basqu school vanguard cuisin howev food must primarili appeal tastebud custom cannot understand chef cuisin return recommend establish chosen lastli would like point cost consider factor write review,very bad review,1,Spanish

From the service, to the presentation, to the aroma, to the flavor - an amazing experience. We both chose the Tasting Menu for our dinner. It was a lot of food, but we were able to eat it all. It was a little expensive, but so worth it! The modern, yet understated decor of the restaurant was pleasing, but kept the focus on the food. The service was impeccable. Each course was presented beautifully and explained thoroughly. I really appreciated the advice on such things as what order to eat each differing bite to get the best progression of flavors. I am an international traveler and have had some incredible meals over the years - but nothing that compared to this meal.

Each dinner was exceptional in its own way, elegant, beautifully presented and delicious, creative food. Each small bite or dish was exquisite, each meal was substantial and I loved the creativity of each of these chefs. The service at each location was superb, the staff were extremely educated on the dishes and eager to share their knowledge, and extremely attentive to your needs and desires. You left each location feeling pampered. Each location was a special, elegant restaurant where you did not feel out of place in jeans and a nice shirt. Each was artfully decorated, and beautiful in its own right. Note: These dinners allow the chefs to be creative in their art, this is not the place you come to for standard fare. Enjoying this meal includes opening you mind and palate to the possibilities and creativity of each of these artists.  Dinner at each of these restaurants is a decadent treat and I was privileged to be able to do three of these on consecutive nights. Specific to Cebo. Food: I loved the food at Cebo. I thought the food was biased towards the seafood side but loved every dish. The food was bolder in flavor than the other restaurants, but the chef did show his creativity in combining flavors and ingredients. The food was once again beautifully presented and the meal was hearty.  Ambiance: The restaurant is beautiful, I loved the open space dominated by the central chandeliers.

There were 2 menus which one can close from, one with 10 dishes, the other with 17 dishes (inspired by the 17 regions of Spain) , as I went with my mom, so we went with the 10 dishes classical menu. The earliest dinner time was 20:30, I guess this is typical for Spanish people. So when we arrived early at 20:00 (thinking to have a drink at the restaurant before dinner ), the restaurant was not open yet and we had to wait around the hotel for the restaurant to open. The service tonight was impeccable. Ways to best enjoy the dishes were explained, and each dish came with an explosion of flavours and some with different layers of flavours as well. My absolute favourite tonight was the squid dish, the different sauces they used brought out the freshness of the squid.   For wines, they have an extensive wine list and 2 different wine pairings to choose from, the classic one (with all Spanish wines) and the premium one (20 and 40 euros respectively) My mom and I don’t speak any Spanish at all and it was not a problem at this establishment as everyone here speaks good English. The price was also very reasonable for a Michelin 1 star restaurant as we only spend just over 200 euros for the 2 of us (that is with wine pairing) I just heard they will be doing a completely different menu in March!

The service staff is impeccable and made us feel very special and welcome, the wine list is very satisfactory and the menu selection was very well balanced with impressive local Spanish products. We really got the feeling that we were tasting the best that Spain has to offer, and we really appreciated the personal table visit from the manager and sous chef to ensure we were having a good experience. Our personal menu favorites were Black Andalusian Squid, the Costa Brava creamy rice and the chocolate dessert at the end of the menu - what we liked a bit less was the piglet ear that was a bit too chewy, the glazed beef that wasn’t really anything special, and the Sweet bites on top of the cotton candy that really was just a bit weird and bland - but we really enjoyed the churro bread to balance this up. This restaurant is the best we have ever tried in Spain, and with a few adjustments we think it has a good potential to climb even higher in the Spanish gastro rankings.

Following a day of sightseeing I decided to look for a restaurant within walking distance of our hotel. Steakburger Gran Via was the choice and an excellent one it was too.

This place is literally across the street from my hotel. I had to try it. I e already had 2 burgers here in Spain and I was underwhelmed to say the least. Fortunately for me, third time's charm. We walked in and were instantly greeted by Bryan and shown to our seat. The place has an upscale feel but it's really not. Very casual in fact. Comfortable open floor plan. They give you the option to customize your burger which is nice. I got a the wings, vanilla shake, a burger and fries. The wings stay crispy since the sauce is on the side. They have four sizes to choose from for burgers. The second option was a big healthy burger. I was shocked that my burger was ordered medium rare and actually came out just that way. A true mid rare at that. I'm actually going back tomorrow to have another before leaving Madrid. The fries weren't the best. But my burger was tasty and cooked right. Nice job! See you soon.

Veal with hearty juice, bacon, cheese and apple cannot go wrong with a ""torch show"" to get that bacon going. Huevos with their style was also superb. Food is great, but the service was better! The barman Santiago was highly attentive, suggesting waiting people to sit around at the bar to comfort them. And of course, I received good services from him despite it wad a super busy days.

The decor is nice and sitting near the window is a great way to people watch. The toilet facilities are a little unnerving though with 5 numbered cubicles downstairs and out of the way with no separation between the ladies and gents.

It's not a very large restaurant so there is limited table space. At least a couple of the waitstaff spoke English and they provided an English version menu which was helpful. We had a pitcher of sangria which was very tasty though a bit on the weak side. The chicken curry was excellent as were several of the other dishes we ordered.

They combine ""mountain and sea"" as a reflection of Spanish cuisine and thus there are a variety of seafood and meat dishes. Tastes are strong and textures varying. Some tastes can be even a bit challenging, but in a good way: if one is tasting through foreing cuisine, there ought to be surprises. In particular the boqueron dish was strong, and for some reason I still keep craving for the marinated variety of the fish. Additional highlight was the surprise dish of asparagus and snapper. Last but not the least, all the courses were extremely beautiful. As for the wines, the more expensive pairing of 40€ was definitely worth the price. In particular the white wine was excellent. Also the pairing with boqueron was perfect. Waiters were keen to keep our glasses full. The waiter who took our wine order has all the reasons to recommend the more expensive package (although surely the less expensive one is also good). Service was top-notch, from entering the restaurant to leaving the place. Courteous, but still easy-going.

Everything was prepared and served with great care, skill, and expertise. In the end the meal was impressive but a bit overwhelming—the anchovy dish and aged raw beef dishes were beautifully prepared but unappealing after having so many other courses. The wine pairings were excellent and generously poured. In the end, we wish we had gone for the less expansive 5 course tasting menu—which appeared on the menu but was never explained or featured as we left feeling impressed by the food and service but a bit weighted down after consuming so much of so many things. Overall an amazing meal but giving people less excessive/ more moderate options might be wise.

For our lunch, we accepted the maître d’s recommendation for the classic 10 course and accompanying wines and boy are we glad we did…. Absolutely superb from start to finish. Faultless food, wine and service. Perhaps the ‘baby piglet ear’ was a fraction chewy and the ‘cheese pistachio’ a tiny too salty but I’m being very, very fussy. The ‘anchovy’ was gorgeous while the ‘costa brava creamy rice’, a lovely innovation, was to die for! They even provided 2 additional complementary surprise courses which were mouth-watering. Absolutely no pretentions from the staff that you often encounter in such establishments with Bianca, our smiling lead hostess, charming and helpful.  Congratulations to the chef and the maitre’d… they deserve all the pundits they receive…Get there before the chef gets his 2nd star and prices rise accordingly!

Fantastic fine-dining evening. Great balance and rhythm between the plates. The total amount of food spot on. Top notch service as you can expect from a restaurant looking for that first star :) The place looks extremely cool, and for once there's plenty of space on the table. There's only one dish the chef has kept in the tasting menu since the beginning. Boquerón (2016) is good and interesting, but it felt more like an artistic break between the superb tasting surprises coming non-stop. At the end of the event, it was a great pleasure to meet the chef himself. He has the attitude set right. That reflects to everything in the restaurant. Are they going to get the first Michelin star?

Very moderately priced. Just away from the insane parts of Gran Via. Also close to City Hall. The service is terrific. Unlike any restaurant I've been to in Spain, they actually give you ice in your water. A nice touch. The pizza was well cooked and unique. My dinner with a coke was 17.70 euros. My lunch for 2 at the Ritz the same day was 100 euros. If you walk back a few blocks in either direction you are in very busy parts of the city. I consider this an oasis.

We had the 17 course taster menu with wine pairing (I would recommend this) and my nerves disappeared after the first course. Each course was amazing and Anna our 'waitress' explained each one in detail. The Chef actually did an additional course as well so 18 in total.

The staff was warm and helpful from the moment we walked into the place. They seated us in front of the open chef’s working area so we could see them prepare the dishes. Those guys are artists. Everyone spoke English well, and explained everything put in front of us. We did the smaller fixed menu for 80E and it was PLENTY of food. The waitress said not to get the bigger one unless we were really hungry. They offer two wine pairings, the “Classic” for a very reasonable 20E a person and a “Premium” for I think 40 or 50E. We chose the Classic because it included Spanish wines. All the wines were delicious (we particularly loved the white Rioja) and they were very generous with their refills, good thing we took an Uber back to our hotel. We started with a nice Cava, then the white Rioja, followed by a fine Ribera del Duero, and finally a Moscato with dessert. The food was a very modern top chef type of deal, with multiple morsels with interesting ingredients and imaginative constructions, hard to describe but trust me, yummy! Many of the dishes came with helpful eating instructions from our waitress, like “eat this first, then that, use your fingers for this,” etc. When I stood up mid-meal to check out the facilities our waitress came over and asked if we were celebrating anything that evening. Well, a big anniversary is coming up, so after dessert came an extra “special” dessert. All absolutely delicious. We were bursting. We spent about 2 1/2 hours there. The whole bill came to 208E, plus tip. I think it’s a great value for the kind of experience you have there. Would definitely return on our next trip to Madrid.

We have found the service in Madrid in general to be very lacklustre and unfriendly. It takes ages to get a menu, ages to order and ages to get your bill, ages to pay. It's quite irritating actually! However this was not the case in this restaurant, which was a breath of fresh air. The service was attentive from the moment we sat down and throughout! Nothing was too much for the waiters. Service with a smile, they were all so pleasant- but Carlos in particular was so helpful. Would highly recommend!  We only hope we find a few more restaurants with the same level of customer service before we go back to Ireland! If not, we shall be back! Thanks again!

From the moment we walked in we were made to feel special by the staff who were all superb.  The service is attentive but really natural and not at all stuffy or pretentious so you are made to feel really relaxed.  The maitre'd explained the philosophy of the restaurant (to showcase local ingredients from the mountains and the sea) and discussed the menu options. We selected a la carte but when we had made our choices our waiter suggested that we could split each dish between us so we effectively ended up with four courses rather than two. We also received 3 complimentary dishes which were all of exquisite quality, featuring unusual ingredients such as sea urchins. All in all a fantastic experience and delivered at a surprisingly reasonable price. We had beers, champagne and wine to accompany the food and the final bill was only €140. We mistakenly thought that the iva was a service charge rather than a tax so shamefully did not leave a tip so hopefully this review will make up for that!

The food was delicious and very artfully presented. We also enjoyed the wine pairing and of course the service was flawless and the ambiance elegant without being overly formal. On top of all of this, it is an incredible value. We ate at four Michelin starred restaurants on our trip and Cebo was about half price of some of them and offered a similar dining experience.

We found the restaurant very easily as it was one of the main roads in the city. The room is very simple and elegant and front of house staff very polite and courteous with a very good knowledge about the food and wine. We booked the Classic Menu which was 80 euros but was treated to few extra dishes from the extended menu as a gift from the restaurant which was a very welcome surprise. Each dish was explained and suggested how was the best way to experience each dish. We had 11 courses in total and with wine our bill was 185 Euros. Its nice to see many bottles of wine around the 20 euro mark in a Michelin Starred establishment, so you don't feel that they are trying to squeeze more money out of you as a customer.

We were tucked away at the back, behind the liquor cabinet, so didn’t get a view of the food prep. Service was attentive, and when I walked to the show kitchen, was asked if there was anything I needed. Feeling odd standing in the middle of the restaurant, I scuttled back to my seat.

Throughout our trip’s dining experiences, this was probably our most ‘casual’ meal and environment, but easily one of our more enjoyable nights. The setting is modern, the staff are young and eager but, most importantly, attentive, knowledgeable and with an excellent grasp of English. The service was quick, the atmosphere was alive and the tapas was fantastic. As with similar eateries, the option to order half portions was pounced upon and all (several) dishes proved excellent. Also, the drink sizes (spirits) are extremely generous!

We were seated right the way and immediately given the menus. Our table was sort of in the middle of the room and the waiters constantly ran by us. I am not sure why the waiters had to move that fast, but it created very uncomfortable feeling as if we were in a train station and not in a restaurant. We ordered 6 tapas, bread basket and drinks. The bread basket came immediately but was almost thrown on the table by the running waiter. The 2 tapas came immediately after. The 3rd tapa came, the small table started to get very crowded, plated had to be moved around to be able to fit the drinks that arrived. Unfortunately that did not stop the running waiter from bringing the rest of the food. Within 5-7 minutes we were served all 6 tapas and the plates were piled up literally one on top of the other on our table. That combined with the running-by waiters created not so relaxing environment. We were out in 30 minutes. The evening was ruined.

First the service, from reception to la cuenta was fantastic. I would expect this from any 1*+ restaurant but sadly we have experienced lower quality treatment at other restaurants in Spain.  The setting is open but somewhat intimate, certain tables get a view of final preparations of courses coming out of the kitchen - which can be a nice touch for those that are into that. All courses were presented beautifully and fully explained. My wife and I posed a few curious questions and our server enthusiastically answered all of them, even darting back to the kitchen to explain some ingredients and inspirations. Knowledge of the wines and pairings was strong and offered freely. As a foodie, I appreciate these additional touches as opposed to just having a plate put in front of me. The reservation process was simple, and confirmed in the days leading up to our date. Overall value was strong for a newer 1* in Madrid. You can get a great meal for <€25 a person in Madrid. You are going to places like Cebo for the artistry, thoughtful and precise menu construction and world class service. On these marks, we highly recommend Cebo for special occasions and I will not hesitate to rebook to experience the menu again as it changes.",2018-07-30,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10428302-Reviews-or100-Cebo-Madrid.html,UID_9522,0.023,0.743,0.234,0.996,0.2469238095238095,0.6426000000000001,0.4273,1347,112,0.0831477357089829,0,25,False,34,0.081081081081081,0.081081081081081,0.3243243243243243,0.054054054054054,0.2702702702702703,0.027027027027027,0.0,0.027027027027027,0.081081081081081,0.054054054054054,233,164,4.781115879828326,0,0,share anniversari dinner cours tast trip spain region pair wine first servic recept la cuenta fantast would expect restaur sadli experienc lower qualiti treatment restaur spain set open somewhat intim certain tabl get view final prepar cours come kitchen nice touch cours present beauti fulli explain wife pose curiou question server enthusiast answer even dart back kitchen explain ingredi inspir knowledg wine pair strong offer freeli foodi appreci addit touch oppos plate put front reserv process simpl confirm day lead date overal valu strong newer madrid get great meal person madrid go place like cebo artistri thought precis menu construct world class servic mark highli recommend cebo special occas hesit rebook experi menu chang,good review,4,Spanish

A phone call led to nothing as I did not wish to be recalled, being fully busy in Madrid in a conference. I thought that I could still book a table by arriving at 8 p.m. Alas I was told that the full restaurant was full from opening time which is 8.30 p.m. I am a fast eater and promised, to no avail, that if allowed to enter at 8.30 p.m. I would leave at 9 p.m. In despair my only solution was to eat at the BAR of the CEBO. This was quite good and very pleasant. Service was amiable and food was very good. They took my order at 8.20 p.m. while they normally open at 8.30 p.m. and I was out by 9.03 p.m.: I intended to try something else in Madrid that I won't mention in this report. The dinner without a starter costed with water and no wine circa 30 euros. The place is small and hopefully it will not be invaded by readers of this report as I wish to go there once more when I return to Madrid.

We knew from the photos and the reviews that we were going to love it, but we didn't realise quite how much!  When you walk in, the restaurant oozes coolness and the decor is so eye-catching. We sat down and were greeted by a lovely waiter named Alex who recommended us a delightful red wine. Alex also helped us to choose all of our tapas dishes, and, let me tell you, this mans recommendations were ON POINT. He recommended us dishes we never would have chosen ourselves, such as the risotto (insane) and burrata (also insane). He was just such a lovely person and we were grateful to him for making our evening so much more enjoyable.  Honestly, this place is a must-visit. You will not be disappointed!

We are just finding our way to trying some great restaurants. Everything we had were so tasty that we said ""wow!"" after each dish we tried. My husband had the menu del dia and his salad with grilled chicken, cheese, caramelized onions, grapes and walnuts with balsamic dressing was very good. My fried shrimp in garlic and peppers were so tasty, my husband mopped up all the sauce with bread. You have to love garlic as there were maybe a dozen slices of garlic in he dish. The ribs were tender and potatoes were sliced thinly with a mandolin in a type of gratin. He got dessert with his meal and had the beet cake which we thought unusual but it was light and a good ending to the meal. But wait, we also got two after dinner shooters of something similar to Baileys when we asked for the check. It was just a lovely lunch with great food and such pleasant staff which adds to the entire experience.

Just from walking past the front had me curious. It was different to the other tapas bars in the area - of which there are plenty! It just had a really cool looking atmosphere. So we took our chances and were SO happy we did! This was the best food we had in Madrid. And ended up going there almost every day for the rest of the trip. A great variety of dishes on the menu suits just about every palette and everything is cooked to perfection and presented beautifully.

There are of course some delicious Spanish tapas, such as Brutal's take on Patatas Bravas, croquetas and queso, but also very delicious steak, chicken and paella comparable to Valencia (in my opinion). We also ordered a cheese dish that was sort of like a ball of mozzarella that the waiter then proceeds to stuff with pesto sauce with a syringe. The service is also very good. We arrived for our reservation a bit early and were seated at the bar and given one small beer each to start. Our waiter was Alex, who was incredibly entertaining and helpful. He made us laugh and spent a lot of time with our table.

If you are going as a group (4 or more people) it usually cost between 10-15euros. Last week I had lunch there (group of 8) and the waiter Alejandro was really nice and amazing.  It is better to have lunch there because they are less busy than night which can lead to some disagreement as the waiters will pressure you to finish on time. Once, we were having diner there as a group and as we were ordering again they told us that they were waiting for another group in 40 minutes which was ok for us but while they were pressuring us it took them 35 minutes to bring two cocktails ... Also, the solomillo was a bit too raw. At the end they offer us a little shot that we never had because we did not want to bother them and walk towards the bar to have the shot but decided to leave because it was too long.

We chose the Classic menu, since it was lunchtime, and the Degustation of 17 courses would have taken us through to re-opening time ! All around there were a myriad of chefs and serving staff, all dressed elegantly in black and with an attention to detail that would have benefited the average operating theatre, so far, so Michelin ! The first two courses ( baby onion and callos) were a work of precision : although, ignoring the way they were plated, both came in the form of a pretty, round, croquette, meant to 'explode in your mouth', perhaps it might have been better to distance these two offerings on the menu ? They weren't, either of them unpleasant,, but you wouldn't come back to Madrid for them, either. The pig's ear should have been deliciously crunchy, like Torreznos, but bits of it were undercooked and so chewy that you couldn't get rid of it.Then came the real punch-line, the anchovies: anchovy ice-cream served on a plate of broth, so that you incorporate the ice-cream into the broth. One mouthful and three of the four of us exploded in disgust. It tasted just like a mouthful of cod liver oil ( Our Belgian friend said that it was like whale oil, same difference) Not only was it disgusting, but it taints the palate for every subsequent course. At the very least a passion fruit sorbet straight afterwards would have helped. The cow was OK: a bit like pulled pork after being cooked for so long, and the truffled cheese bombe, disappointing. At this point in the meal you would have given anything for a plain slice of Manchego Anejo cheese: one was just so sick of everything being 'de and re-constructed' Not an experience one would repeat, but the staff were immaculate, and our table manager, Bianca, in particular, turned the experience into a pleasant, memorable one",2018-05-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10428302-Reviews-or130-Cebo-Madrid.html,UID_15314,0.076,0.8,0.124,0.9588,0.0616916099773242,0.5570907029478457,0.6077199999999999,2024,164,0.0810276679841897,2,65,False,57,0.0933333333333333,0.1333333333333333,0.2,0.0533333333333333,0.1466666666666666,0.0266666666666666,0.0933333333333333,0.0266666666666666,0.1333333333333333,0.0933333333333333,353,220,4.736543909348442,0,0,demarc michelin aspir real restaur becom mark two thing food share good flavour techniqu sadli cebo fell count chose classic menu sinc lunchtim degust cours would taken us open time around myriad chef serv staff dress elegantli black attent detail would benefit averag oper theatr far michelin first two cours babi onion callo work precis although ignor way plate came form pretti round croquett meant explod mouth perhap might better distanc two offer menu either unpleas come back madrid either pig ear delici crunchi like torrezno bit undercook chewi get rid came real punch line anchovi anchovi ice cream serv plate broth incorpor ice cream broth one mouth three four us explod disgust tast like mouth cod liver oil belgian friend said like whale oil differ disgust taint palat everi subsequ cours least passion fruit sorbet straight afterward would help cow ok bit like pull pork cook long truffl chees bomb disappoint point meal would given anyth plain slice manchego anejo chees one sick everyth de construct experi one would repeat staff immacul tabl manag bianca particular turn experi pleasant memor one,very bad review,1,French

Based on reading TripAdvisor reviews I thought I was in for a treat, far from it. My food experience was abysmal. I'm traveling alone and tried to order paella. It turns out they only serve it to 2 or more people. How bizarre? It's already hard enough going to dinner alone, why make it harder on people? So I stuck with getting a tapa order of burrata. Wow was it bad. I could barely stomach a couple of bites before giving up on it. What a waste of 9 euro. I've had burrata before so I have other experiences to compare it to. Their burrata's texture was off. Then it was injected with flavoring (which is a cool concept) but the pesto like injection was so salty it was like spooning salt into my mouth. The burrata came with 3 tomatoes which were very sour and arugula that was far past fresh, it was all wilted. The wait staff was pleasant. I asked for my check quickly having barely eaten any of the burrata. They asked if I didn't like it. I was polite, but honest in my response that, ""no, I didn't like it."" It would have been nice not to have been charged for it, but alas I consider it a wash of a night and wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. If you want good burrata, for a third of the price you can get some in the Mercado de San Miguel or for comparative prices but better tasting, try another restaurant. To give the place a bone, since I'm giving it a terrible review, the layout is very hip and I think it could be a fun place for a drinks (not food!) experience with a group of people.

Unfortunately, we had just arrived after 12+ hours of travelling from California and the 17 course tasting menu proved to be a little over the top for tired travelers. However, the staff was so very gracious, and allowed us to stop at 12 courses and insisted we finish off with one of the signature (out of 3!) desserts and we were glad we did. Some standouts were the anchovy on lavender, presented on top of seaweed in a bowl of lavender dry ice (magnificent presentation!) and the mushroom broth dish which was an amazing umami experience.

They are all excellent. You should have a very good meal and an enjoyable evening in each of them. We did.  The menu and quality of food and presentation at Etimo was outstanding. It was imaginative, delicate, mouth watering and thoroughly enjoyable. It must be the best in Madrid. The table service was a bit hesitant (reflecting the fact that the restaurant has only been open 5 months) but the Chef and Maitre ensured this did not affect overall service. The menu at Montes was brilliant mixture of new and familiar. It included a fois gras starter, a favourite of mine, and the sirloin steak melted in the mouth. The service was excellent. Wine flowed like water. The whole evening was a delightful entertainment. Cebu was by far the best for classical service and for elegance but I found the set menu rather too experimental for my taste and some of the flavours extreme. In my personal opinion, last week Etimo was first for food, closely followed by Montes. Cebo was first for classical service.

Unlike many of the other tapa places we tried, this one had a good mix of fun, busy atmosphere and comfortable personal space. The staff was very comfortable with speaking English and it wasn't long before Carla came over and became our tapa-ordering guru for the evening. She advised us to order half portions of the best dishes and made sure to bring them out in the perfect order to satisfy our palates. Order anything of the daily suggestions menu (because it's guaranteed to be delicious). Off the everyday menu we really enjoyed the curry chicken, the musaka, the tiramisu, and the beet cake. Also do yourself a favor and order a pitched of sangria. It's spectacular and has a full body of flavorful fruit and cinnamon spice. As if Carla couldn't get any better, she brought us out these delightful complimentary shots of watermelon, mint, and vodka. Perfect way to end a very delicious meal.

The shakshuka is absolutely delicious, the mix of different textures was divine. It was such a homey meal that it kept me noticeably warm for hours.
