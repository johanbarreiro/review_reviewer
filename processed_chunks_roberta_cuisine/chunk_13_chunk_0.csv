The food (buffet style) was delicious. The theme of the brunch was Mexico, and in addition to what you would expect of a brunch buffet, they also served tacos, enchiladas and ceviche. The specialty drink had tequila and rose liqueur (delicious). The food was very good, with a lot of selection for a brunch menu. About an hour into the meal, as the kids were starting to get bored, an entertainer came to get the kids. They went to another room and made ballon animals. That was great because it gave us a chance to eat at our leisure without having to worry about the kids. At the end, the waiters brought a birthday cake, which I thought was a very nice gesture.

They start serving dinner at 8:00 pm. We ordered tomatoe soup and shrimp for a starter. They had a little bowl of shrimp mousse covered with crushed nuts as a welcome gesture for us. My husband ordered vegetarian paella. He claimed that he had never had a better taste than that one. It was served to him in portions which meant that it was still warm to the last bite. For me, I wanted to have grilled salmon but it was not on their menu. However, nothing is impossible in that place; the Chef would prepare the food that you wish to eat because it is not pre prepared, it is done right then and there. This shows quite clearly in the taste and texture. We ended our meal by ordering gelato and cream brule' and again, we were impressed. We really enjoyed our meal there. The service was excellent.

We ordered the Croquettes, which we beautiful. Light and flavoursome. But before that came out we were given a free entree of a crab salad. Fish is not our thing, but we did try it, and I must say it had huge flavour.  We had the Paella as a shared main. Although just a chicken was is not on the menu, they cooked us one. And it was lovely. We then followed with a chocolate mousse. Very nice. We had a bottle of Cava with our meal. Which was very good as well.  My only criticism is the price of the drinks at the bar,€9.50 for a pint of beer is too steep in my eyes. Other than that, a great place to eat.

The standard room we were in overlooked the inner courtyard and had its own little balcony, which would have been great if the weather was warmer. Having said that the balmy 16 degrees was great for exploring the city. We were able to walk for miles without feeling enervated by the heat. The room was quite small and had a rather strange shape but it was adequate for our needs.  As the food on offer in the club lounge was so good, both for breakfast and in the evening for 'snacks', we ended up not needing to sample the restaurant! The wines on offer were delicious and many of the hot snacks were so filling we couldn't have eaten or drunk any more! The hotel was very well situated for exploring all the main tourist sites in central Madrid and yet as it is in a quieter location at night we got a good night's sleep.

We had not booked, but we arrived at 22 and we were waiting an hour to have a table. This, it could be understood if it were not because there were two free of two people (without being reserved), and two couples who were at tables of 4. In addition, some guests finished at about 22:15 and after paying they did after-dinner (logical ) but neither the waiter nor anything hurried them or not.

I don't know if it's the fault of the restaurant or the cuisine, but this was a pretty sad dinner experience overall. The restaurant looks very nice from the outside, but don't let this lure you in. The food is extremely plain and disappointing. My girlfriend had the khachapuri which is basically just egg and cheese on a sort of pizza dough. Good enough for what it was, but overall just kind of sad. I can't attest to the authenticity of the dish, but as it was it feels completely unworthy of being a main dish. I had the chef's recommendation of steamed buns filled with minced meat (basically like dim sum/gyoza). The meat was well seasoned but the dish was just underwhelming; it felt like it was missing a lot of other things to provide anything close to a fulfilling meal. None of the other things described to us from the menu sounded remotely appealing, and even the chef was shaking his head when talking about some of them. Despite Georgia having a rich winemaking tradition, all they had to drink was Spanish wine, unfortunately. The wine was good, sure, but you can find that anywhere and you can actually pair it with much better/more interesting food. Also note that the value for money here is not great. Overall, I feel it is a shame to waste a meal on this place when you're in Madrid and have such amazing choices available almost everywhere. I cannot understand how this place has such a high rating.",2017-11-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d10536551-Reviews-or40-Khachapuri-Madrid.html,UID_674,0.121,0.743,0.136,0.7205,0.1058751608751608,0.4978206778206777,0.4547,1491,137,0.0918846411804158,0,38,False,53,0.0625,0.109375,0.25,0.046875,0.171875,0.03125,0.046875,0.0625,0.140625,0.078125,268,173,4.567164179104478,0,0,never georgian food know expect know fault restaur cuisin pretti sad dinner experi overal restaur look nice outsid let lure food extrem plain disappoint girlfriend khachapuri basic egg chees sort pizza dough good enough overal kind sad attest authent dish feel complet unworthi main dish chef recommend steam bun fill minc meat basic like dim sum gyoza meat well season dish underwhelm felt like miss lot thing provid anyth close fulfil meal none thing describ us menu sound remot appeal even chef shake head talk despit georgia rich winemak tradit drink spanish wine unfortun wine good sure find anywher actual pair much better interest food also note valu money great overal feel shame wast meal place madrid amaz choic avail almost everywher cannot understand place high rate,bad review,2,Spanish

And nice baguette with addictive chimichurri. I ate whole basket on my own and couldnt stop. Wifey had a peperoni pizza and said it was good enough. This place really caught us by surprise. Staff was very kind and smiling. Only slight negative was their half-opened kitchen. Searing a steak produces quite some smoke. Their ventilation was pretty effective but there was a smell of burnt beef fat lingering in the air anyway. But it was not that intrusive, just being picky.

Basically, the pasta is cooked by the chefs and then finished off at the table by the waiting staff as you look on drooling into your napkin. They swirl the pasta around a wheel of Parmesa coat it in the cheese. The idea is that the heat will slowly melt the cheese on the edge of the wheel, thus coating the pasta to perfection. By adding extra cheese and nuts on top, They created seriously tasty cheese wheel pasta. You shouldn't miss this dish if you are in Madrid, yes, you may find a better one in Italy but may not in Madrid. The second must try dish is the most famous Italian dessert in the world - Tiramisu and it is one of our absolute favorite desserts. You can find the truly best homemade of the best Tiramisu in this tiny little restaurant. This is the dish you shouldn't be miss if you come to Madrid!

I would say however if you’re used to a ‘british’ style cooking, maybe ‘up’ your preference (I.e. if you like it medium rare, ask for medium)  Thank you to Gaby for also recommending a great bar for a post-dinner drink (or seven)",2019-04-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d4698301-Reviews-or80-Pampa_Beef-Madrid.html,UID_12059,0.0,0.742,0.258,0.9823,0.4509259259259259,0.7228395061728397,0.5530333333333334,540,43,0.0796296296296296,1,16,False,22,0.2,0.2,0.5,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,97,77,4.56701030927835,0,0,recommend visit pampa beef coupl friend visit previous holiday glad took recommend gabi amaz realli attent made sure everyth need lomo alto partner sirloin cook perfectli would say howev use british style cook mayb prefer e like medium rare ask medium thank gabi also recommend great bar post dinner drink seven,good review,4,Spanish

Most outdoor restaurants are on sidewalks with street, so it's nice to have outdoor dining without street noise and fumes. The ambiance is rather bland, however. The bread selections were nice and warm and crisp and the olive oil really delicious. The artichokes and ham was very tasty. The monkfish was not great. The service was not as attentive as other great restaurants in Madrid ( Triciclo, Candela). The worst part was that the seating was on a wooden platform and every time the waiters walked by everything on the table shook in a jarring way. I thought the flower vase would bounce off the table it would jump so much when the waiters walked by. One waiter seemed to walk smoothly; the rest were oblivious. Even though the were constantly stomping back and forth, our water glasses would go empty ( even though we were eating at an odd time so there were only 2 other tables with guests). 3 stars may seem harsh, but I'm taking into account the fact that the price was the same as our meal at Triciclo, which was heaps better.

We had reserved via telephone. At first they could not find my name but eventually did. Tables for two are in disappointing locations tables for four or large groups are better placed. We got our table but I switched the seating arrangement as I was facing towards the entrance, no one seemed bothered or came to help. Service is a bit slow to start and if you have not been before it is difficult to know how it works as no one explains. We had to ask for wine list most people seem to drink by the glass. A varied choice with some excellent starters. You could fill up on first courses alone. Mains were good, pork or beef but lots of other dishes. Desserts were lovely and there was also a chocolate fountain. We had lots to eat, all very tasty.. Although this is a self service a bit more attentiveness re pouring our wine would have been good. Cannot fault the food. There were two opera singers entertaining. The female had the better voice but at times reached the top of her range. I would recommend experiencing the buffet but would suggest pushing for a better table. It was quite obvious that some locals who seemed to be known to the staff got better service and for this reason I am not giving this five stars.

Instead, I was only their second customer. This was early in the COVID-19 period, but it had had an effect on foot traffic in restaurants around Madrid.  No matter... the restaurant is neat and stylishly laid out. I could see why it would be a happening place under normal circumstances. The service was great. I chatted with one of the waiters, who helped me out with wine and dish selections. They were pretty much spot on. I had the sea bass, which was outstanding, and a portobello carpaccio. Normally these dishes would be shared, but I was there myself, so the carpaccio was a bit too much mushroom overall for me. It was still good, though. Just better with a smaller individual portion. I can't remember what I had for dessert (I think pineapple was involved?), but it was fantastic. And the waiter commended me on my choice, so that's always nice.  Anyway, I highly recommend. Great food, lovely setting, and - presumably - a fantastic atmosphere.

After over a week of enjoying Spanish and Catalunya food we wanted to try out “home food”, the spicy Indian curry. We visited Curry Y Canela based on high reviews in Trip Advisor, and we found this even better than the reviews we had read. We ordered potato Bhajji for appraiser, a glass of red wine, chicken curry, garlic nan bread and Mountain fried rice. The red wine suggested was really good. All the dishes were very tasty. Trust me our family enjoys high quality Indian curries regularly at home, so when I say it was so yummy, it really was. The mountain fried rice is a very simple vegetable fried rice, but it’s something exemplary. The texture and right combinations of spices, not very overwhelming, was done really well. It matched high recommendations by others. While the food is yummy, the service and atmosphere was even better.

They were very friendly, always available and professional yet still relaxed. Very warm atmosphere. The starter was excellent and steaks were awesome, fries cooked to excellency. Wine was good and it was offered plenty. We went here again on our vacation and the waiter remembered what we like to drink without even telling.

A lady brings your food and waits for someone to tell her who has served what. If you do not want one dish after the other suggest you tell when ordering.  Food looked a picture, but sauces were too reduced and salty for us or perhaps too much sauce. We did not like squid starter, nor prawn ‘stew’. Deer looked a picture but was cold in the middle and accompaniments too strong (salty/sweet) for me. Cod dish was tasty, but again very salty. Ideal for couples. Food went down a storm with other guests, just not us, hence gave it four stars. Daughter did not feel well so we left early and kind headwaiter offered a mint tea which was much appreciated.

We order a nice bottle of white wine which was great and a nice chilled bucket for it at our table. We began with beef carpaccio and the signature oven burrata (there were multiple burrata options to choose from) which was accompanied with strawberries, grapes, pesto, salad, and tomatoes.

We went for dinner having reserved a table. The décor is attractive. I have to say the waiter (maybe the owner?) was excellent, friendly, interested and attentive. The complimentary pappadoms (with pickle tray) were crisp and fresh.  For main course, one chose chicken vindaloo 12.95€ and the other chose lamb rogan josh 13.95€ with white rice 4.95€ and a side dish of mixed tarka dahl (lentils) 9.95€ to share. Being British and therefore very accustomed to the spiciness of Indian food, we had ordered the vindaloo as this is normally very spicy and asked for the tarka dahl to be spicy, but for our tastes the food wasn’t particularly spicy. Yet I note that some Spanish reviewers (probably less accustomed to Indian food) found their dishes too spicy! A difficult situation for the restaurant owner, in meeting the client´s varied expectations, but all of the food was of very good quality and well presented. We recommend clients to discuss their preferred degree of spiciness with the waiter when ordering. One had mango ice cream 5.95€ as dessert which was delicious. Food was very good, service was excellent. We wish the restaurant owner and staff the best of success.",2019-10-23,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d17534945-Reviews-or10-Curry_y_Canela-Madrid.html,UID_12317,0.013,0.78,0.207,0.9934,0.2998148148148147,0.4994444444444444,0.3323230769230769,1293,93,0.0719257540603248,1,36,False,43,0.1,0.2285714285714285,0.3142857142857143,0.0428571428571428,0.2285714285714285,0.0,0.0142857142857142,0.0285714285714285,0.0285714285714285,0.0142857142857142,217,152,4.95852534562212,0,0,accord tripadvisor restaur madrid curri canela current list number went dinner reserv tabl cor attract say waiter mayb owner excel friendli interest attent complimentari pappadom pickl tray crisp fresh main cours one chose chicken vindaloo chose lamb rogan josh white rice side dish mix tarka dahl lentil share british therefor accustom spici indian food order vindaloo normal spici ask tarka dahl spici tast food particularli spici yet note spanish review probabl less accustom indian food found dish spici difficult situat restaur owner meet client vari expect food good qualiti well present recommend client discuss prefer degre spici waiter order one mango ice cream dessert delici food good servic excel wish restaur owner staff best success,very good review,5,Indian

If you´re interested in shopping and watching people, this is a good place to be, so finding this restaurant was a great surprise. There were four of us and we tried pizza (Margarita with Pepperoni and Del Monte), pasta (Tagliatelle de Bolognese) and a Gogonzola salad. With drinks the total came to about 50 Euros. Pretty nice considering the location and quality of the food. Flavor was great. Service was friendly and efficient and our food came surprisingly fast. You can actually watch them make the pizzas and cook them in three large ovens. Bathrooms are spacious and clean and they have paper towels to dry your hands.

They taught us about the food being presented, right down to how to go about eating it so we didn’t look like rookies! we asked our server to pair our meals with wine for each course, which is highly recommended to get the most of your experience and learn about the different flavours that accompany a proper meal and wine pairing! Every course was surprising and delightful! At the end of our stay we were welcomed into the kitchen to take a little tour and met the pastry chef. We felt extremely honoured and it was a perfect and special ending to the best dining experience we’ve ever had. We’ve eaten Michelin star restaurants in the past, and although we wonder why this extremely talented chef and her team hasn’t been acknowledged with a star themselves, we’ve tasted their dishes and can confidently say the stars don’t make the restaurant when it comes to Etimo. Try it, you’ll fall in love and never want the experience to end!",2018-11-25,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13138415-Reviews-or60-Restaurante_Etimo_by_Begona_Fraire-Madrid.html,UID_12363,0.009,0.784,0.207,0.9954,0.3150563236047107,0.5710547875064005,0.25102,1403,114,0.0812544547398431,5,20,False,57,0.1428571428571428,0.2222222222222222,0.3174603174603174,0.0793650793650793,0.1746031746031746,0.0158730158730158,0.0,0.0,0.0317460317460317,0.0158730158730158,248,161,4.661290322580645,0,0,experi amaz time step foot insid restaur three hour later reluctantli left opt full tast menu lucki enough hit season mushroom delight number plate differ mushroom present full flavour mysteri dine room gorgeou cozi staff attent friendli accommod made us feel like famili taught us food present right go eat look like rooki ask server pair meal wine cours highli recommend get experi learn differ flavour accompani proper meal wine pair everi cours surpris delight end stay welcom kitchen take littl tour met pastri chef felt extrem honour perfect special end best dine experi ever eaten michelin star restaur past although wonder extrem talent chef team acknowledg star tast dish confid say star make restaur come etimo tri fall love never want experi end,good review,4,French

As we were escorted through Etimo's beautiful dining room, we momentarily doubted our decision to eat dinner in the basement kitchen. But boy were we wrong. Etimo's food is outstanding...regardless of where you eat it. But I'm sure it tasted even better because we were surrounded by the friendly graciousness of Begona herself, as well as her very capable staff led by David, and the wonderful chefs who calmly make the magic happen. Begona, who is delightful and HARD working, was more than happy to show us all around the kitchen and share stories with us about the food and her family. We happened to meet the truffle guy who was delivering his seasonal bounty and proudly showed it off to us. We enjoyed seeing the chefs prep out their ingredients and review their notes. It was such an extraordinary opportunity to enjoy world class food in an intimate and unusual setting.

Reviews led us astray a bit in that the restaurant is NOT as vegetarian-friendly as some reviews made it out to be—they can work with you, but it's a fixed menu, so often their vegetarian solution is just to eliminate the protein from the dish, which doesn't always leave you with a very filling meal. Luckily, my boyfriend was able to work around this and we had a delicious meal, opting for the 4-course tasting. Every single dish was delicious—the citrus creme brulee was a standout, as was the pre-first course shiitake broth.

We were drawn into a warm and friendly ambience, where the tasting menu was explained to us. We chose the five-course tasting menu. To describe every dish in detail would take too many words, but the flavours and textures of each perfectly balanced dish prepared one for the arrival of the next. As each dish arrived, so did a detailed explanation from the perfectly English speaking waiting staff. My wife and I were lucky enough to meet Begoña in her kitchen, where we chatted about food and the excellent meal both of us had experienced. The kitchen was busy and at the height of service was calm and immaculate - almost military. My wife and I eat out a lot particularly in London and other European destinations, but Etimo has climbed to the top of our gastronomic experiences, including a few Michelin starred restaurants. I also had to confess to Begoña that there were a couple of dishes that I'm going to try hard to re-create in my own kitchen. I could say, a must to visit if we're in Madrid again, but I really think Etimo is worth hopping on a plane for, just for the experience.",2018-10-01,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13138415-Reviews-or70-Restaurante_Etimo_by_Begona_Fraire-Madrid.html,UID_12383,0.011,0.85,0.139,0.9862,0.2690972222222222,0.4555555555555555,0.4160555555555556,1213,104,0.0857378400659521,0,26,False,48,0.125,0.125,0.4,0.025,0.2,0.025,0.0,0.025,0.075,0.0,218,147,4.568807339449541,0,0,taxi driver drop us outsid etimo discreet facad unprepar experi await us drawn warm friendli ambienc tast menu explain us chose five cours tast menu describ everi dish detail would take mani word flavour textur perfectli balanc dish prepar one arriv next dish arriv detail explan perfectli english speak wait staff wife lucki enough meet bego kitchen chat food excel meal us experienc kitchen busi height servic calm immacul almost militari wife eat lot particularli london european destin etimo climb top gastronom experi includ michelin star restaur also confess bego coupl dish go tri hard creat kitchen could say must visit madrid realli think etimo worth hop plane experi,very good review,5,French

They are all excellent. You should have a very good meal and an enjoyable evening in each of them. We did.  The menu and quality of food and presentation at Etimo was outstanding. It was imaginative, delicate, mouth watering and thoroughly enjoyable. It must be the best in Madrid. The table service was a bit hesitant (reflecting the fact that the restaurant has only been open 5 months) but the Chef and Maitre ensured this did not affect overall service. The menu at Montes was a brilliant mixture of new and familiar. It included a fois gras starter, a favourite of mine, and the sirloin steak melted in the mouth. The service was excellent. Wine flowed like water. The whole evening was a delightful entertainment. Cebu was by far the best for classical service and for elegance but I found the set menu rather too experimental for my taste and some of the flavours extreme. In my personal opinion, last week Etimo was first for food, closely followed by Montes. Cebo was first for classical service. And Montes was first for all-round fun and engagement.",2018-04-21,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13138415-Reviews-or120-Restaurante_Etimo_by_Begona_Fraire-Madrid.html,UID_12393,0.006,0.762,0.232,0.9954,0.353108504398827,0.532297165200391,0.41881875,1217,104,0.0854560394412489,0,27,False,39,0.125,0.2142857142857142,0.3214285714285714,0.0714285714285714,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0178571428571428,0.0,216,136,4.6342592592592595,0,0,group friend pleasur tri three top restaur madrid week cebo etimo mont de galicia excel good meal enjoy even menu qualiti food present etimo outstand imagin delic mouth water thoroughli enjoy must best madrid tabl servic bit hesit reflect fact restaur open month chef maitr ensur affect overal servic menu mont brilliant mixtur new familiar includ foi gra starter favourit mine sirloin steak melt mouth servic excel wine flow like water whole even delight entertain cebu far best classic servic eleg found set menu rather experiment tast flavour extrem person opinion last week etimo first food close follow mont cebo first classic servic mont first round fun engag,very good review,5,Spanish

We especially loved the setas in the first course, the vieiras and salmonete second, and the bonito, the chipirones and the vaca vieja third courses. The desserts offered another impressive creativity, especially the queso de cabra and the creme brûlée of citrus.

Most of the other tables seemed to be filled with locals. Togo felt like an authentic Spanish restaurant. There is nothing touristy about it at all. If you are visiting Madrid, you should do yourself a favor and eat at Toga.

The food was absolutely amazing. It's a great change to traditional Spanish food (which you can get a bit tired of after living here for a while). The food is mostly Peruvian (ceviche...) & Argentinian and it is AMAZING. The menu is pretty small which, in my opinion, shows that the ingredients are fresh. We've been there 3 times and we tried different dishes every time and they were all delicious. The staff is very passionate and proud of their restaurant. They are very nice and dedicated people who take time to talk to you and answer any questions even when the place is full (and still manage to serve the food quite quickly).

I was able to visit her again at “Étimo”, her new restaurant in the center of Madrid. It represents the evolution of her style, care for the environment and atmosphere and food experience. It was her first opening day, with over half of the team new. But I was able to experience the same lovely food touch, but at the next level.  At Etimo you will be able to sense and eat lovely sophisticated food at a very reasonable price. For me the highest is always how she brings to life top quality food that she carefully selects with new textures and tastes. A pleasure to the eyes as well, it’s looks as delicious as in your mouth. The desserts are a must have as well so create that space when enjoying the food.  She makes a delicious daily bread, something that I consider a must for a restaurant if that quality.  I would clearly recommend any dish from the menu. Or just check with her and her team what are they specially proud that day. In my first visit, I selected the “Salteado de Setas de Temporada, Mató Casero y Pesto de Salvia”, followed by the “Bonito, Risotto Escabechado y Albahaca” (her preferred version, which is the spicy one) and to end, the fabulous “Manzana, Arroz con Leche y Maíz”.

This review is based on my own experience; my partner wasn't so impressed. This was because he is vegetarian and I do eat fish, so I had much more choice and was completely satisfied, whereas he left feeling a bit hungry. The service was great - especially from the waiter who was as passionate about wine as I am! We had a conversation about the wonderful Amphora Roja which I chose, and which I would thoroughly recommend. Each of the five courses was like a work of art; although they were beautiful to look at, I do not mean that. I mean each was a masterpiece of flavour and texture. There were unexpected combinations, but they all worked beautifully. The cod was unlike anything I have ever had - utterly 'melt in the mouth'. I felt curious about the avocado chocolate dessert, which sounded strange but was richly delicious. My favourite dish of the evening was the bisque which was perfect. The chef herself was amazing to talk to also - what a lovely evening we had!

After some research, we booked a table at Restaurante Étimo. When entering the restaurant, it somehow felt like walking into a newly opened New York restaurant - in a good way (and not as dense). The interior is kept relatively plain, with a painted brick wall, linen on the table and some colored glassware. We started with a nice aperitivo - a 2011 Cava. As I already indicated in the reservation that I'm vegetarian, the waiter explained which menu items could be prepared in a vegetarian way. We went for the five courses, with a vegetarian option for me (at first, the waiter suggested that I would only take four courses as a fifth one might be difficult - but apparently the chef then told him she could also modify another dish into a vegetarian option). Also, we got a very nice Thousand Milk's 2011, a white assemblage from Rioja - suggested by their sommelier on the wine list.  The menu is composed as two starters, then a fish and afterwards a meat dish (or one of the two in case you go for four courses), sorbet to clean the pallet and finally a dessert. When served, all dishes got explained by the waiter - and all of them were delicious, full of flavor, well-seasoned and beautifully plated. After the meal, the waiter told us that Begoña worried whether the vegetarian version didn't disappoint - I reassured him that she doesn't have to.  The overall meal with all courses, aperitivo and wine came down to 241 EUR, which is not cheap - but an absolutely fair price for good produce and excellent work. When paying, Begoña dropped by, asked how it was and offered to show us the kitchen. We gladly took the offer. We had an inspiring discussion about her background, food and on whether she wants a star in the Guide. Talking to her was as much a highlight of the evening as the great food. We will definitely come again when we are in town next.",2018-07-15,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13138415-Reviews-or90-Restaurante_Etimo_by_Begona_Fraire-Madrid.html,UID_12536,0.011,0.835,0.154,0.9958,0.2886952474049248,0.5851114834985803,0.40300625,1983,164,0.0827029752899647,0,57,False,70,0.0895522388059701,0.1492537313432835,0.2985074626865671,0.0746268656716417,0.1791044776119403,0.0149253731343283,0.044776119402985,0.0298507462686567,0.0746268656716417,0.044776119402985,359,220,4.520891364902507,0,0,trip look upscal modern european dine experi also vegetarian option research book tabl restaurant timo enter restaur somehow felt like walk newli open new york restaur good way dens interior kept rel plain paint brick wall linen tabl color glasswar start nice aperitivo cava alreadi indic reserv vegetarian waiter explain menu item could prepar vegetarian way went five cours vegetarian option first waiter suggest would take four cours fifth one might difficult appar chef told could also modifi anoth dish vegetarian option also got nice thousand milk white assemblag rioja suggest sommeli wine list menu compos two starter fish afterward meat dish one two case go four cours sorbet clean pallet final dessert serv dish got explain waiter delici full flavor well season beauti plate meal waiter told us bego worri whether vegetarian version disappoint reassur overal meal cours aperitivo wine came eur cheap absolut fair price good produc excel work pay bego drop ask offer show us kitchen gladli took offer inspir discuss background food whether want star guid talk much highlight even great food definit come town next,very good review,5,French

On arrival the entrance is fairly modest but the dining room is comfy and although contemporary has a real elegance and charm. The staff were delightful and had real passion and knowledge of the food being served. They were friendly and attentive, taking great pride in describing each course. There was a four or five course option that had balance regardless of your choice. We went for the five course option and I'm delighted we did as each course seemed to link seamlessly. Delicious appetizers, bread, pre-desert palate cleanser and petit fours added to the experience. Every course, from the octopus, crayfish, black cod, beef and extraordinary creme brulee was a beautiful blend of taste and texture and showcased the skill of this very talented chef. Even the wine, recommended by staff was a joy (and remarkably inexpensive!).  After our meal we were invited to meet the chef and see the kitchen - having done this exchange of pleasantries a few times I wasn't too bothered but even this turned into a lovely experience. The chef; Begona Fraire came across to chat and was an absolute delight. She has a passion and understanding of food that shone through and was so interested in what my wife and I had to say about our own foodie experiences. We left feeling very privileged to have experienced this wonderful restaurant and will make every effort to revisit when we are next in the beautiful City of Madrid.",2018-09-11,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13138415-Reviews-or80-Restaurante_Etimo_by_Begona_Fraire-Madrid.html,UID_12550,0.005,0.702,0.293,0.9987,0.4752083333333333,0.6375000000000001,0.2885166666666667,1551,128,0.0825274016763378,1,30,False,52,0.1047619047619047,0.1714285714285714,0.3809523809523809,0.0476190476190476,0.1809523809523809,0.0095238095238095,0.0285714285714285,0.019047619047619,0.019047619047619,0.0380952380952381,267,179,4.808988764044944,0,0,book restaur well advanc wife birthday four day visit madrid could chosen better arriv entranc fairli modest dine room comfi although contemporari real eleg charm staff delight real passion knowledg food serv friendli attent take great pride describ cours four five cours option balanc regardless choic went five cours option delight cours seem link seamlessli delici appet bread pre desert palat cleanser petit four ad experi everi cours octopu crayfish black cod beef extraordinari creme brule beauti blend tast textur showcas skill talent chef even wine recommend staff joy remark inexpens meal invit meet chef see kitchen done exchang pleasantri time bother even turn love experi chef begona frair came across chat absolut delight passion understand food shone interest wife say foodi experi left feel privileg experienc wonder restaur make everi effort revisit next beauti citi madrid,very good review,5,Spanish

We loved it so much we decided to come back for a city break in Madrid to specifically eat at a couple of restaurants we wanted to return to. Including this one. As much as the meat was as good as expected, our experience was less so this time. We went on a Saturday evening, so presumably more people, we tried to book a table but they don't do reservations so had to wait outside 15 minutes. As fluent our Spanish was, the waiter insisted on speaking english and felt more of some generic know nothing tourists, asking if we knew what chimichuri was. When we ordered our food and asked for red wine, they did not disclose what wine it was nor was given the choice. They made a mistake with my partner's order so ended up with something different than what she ordered.

This is so far from that it's not even a conversation. I have no idea how and why anyone gives this restaurant high marks.  The service at Etimo is a joke. We were given menus but no wine menus. We then ordered and got a starter and waited at least 3-4 minutes before someone scampered over and explained what was in front of us and what the progression of this starter was. Simple things that any fine dining experience knows to do. The other problem is the waiters don't communicate so you have 2-3 different people asking if you know what you're eating. But never once does anyone ask if its any good, which is smart because, besides the starters, the answer would have been no.  My wife and I both at the last minute decided to go with the 4-courses instead of five because we had some trepidation on the menu after the lack of knowledge by the servers. I am so glad we did. Just to give some highlights the tuna was the fishiest tuna I've ever had. The beef which was cooked rare instead of medium rare was a cheap top sirloin and rather lousy, and the palette cleanser made me want to vomit. By the time the meal ended my wife and I were laughing at just how utterly bad the entire experience was, and then they swiped my credit card for almost $200 and it became less funny. Look I think the decor and the ambiance could be a real winner. But the menu is odd, the items which we had at least 50% of the menu were all bad, and the service was atrocious for this price for a meal. There are so many amazing places to eat in Madrid, do not make the same mistake we did and eat here.",2018-09-08,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d13138415-Reviews-or80-Restaurante_Etimo_by_Begona_Fraire-Madrid.html,UID_12579,0.09,0.792,0.117,0.8918,0.0932068452380952,0.5728645833333332,0.7561470588235294,1757,180,0.1024473534433693,0,37,False,61,0.1153846153846153,0.0897435897435897,0.2051282051282051,0.0641025641025641,0.1025641025641025,0.0512820512820512,0.0769230769230769,0.0641025641025641,0.141025641025641,0.0897435897435897,338,213,4.195266272189349,0,0,cut chase place disast wife incred fortun live eat sever michelin star win deserv eateri far even convers idea anyon give restaur high mark servic etimo joke given menu wine menu order got starter wait least minut someon scamper explain front us progress starter simpl thing fine dine experi know problem waiter commun differ peopl ask know eat never anyon ask good smart besid starter answer would wife last minut decid go cours instead five trepid menu lack knowledg server glad give highlight tuna fishiest tuna ever beef cook rare instead medium rare cheap top sirloin rather lousi palett cleanser made want vomit time meal end wife laugh utterli bad entir experi swipe credit card almost becam less funni look think decor ambianc could real winner menu odd item least menu bad servic atroci price meal mani amaz place eat madrid make mistak eat,average review,3,Italian

The food is absolutely fantastic here and the staff were extremely professional and helpful too. I had read many reviews on TripAdvisor already so decided to go on the many recommendations and order the ceviche for starters and tuna noodle dish also. Its definitely something I wouldn't want to order by hearing the name but it was absolutely amazing. My favourite was the tuna noodle dish. We then ordered pork and veg which was also delicious and two Australian couples that sat beside us highly recommended the cheese dish which we then ordered to share also.

We found, on the way back to our hotel after our lovely evening, that Google maps doesn’t necessarily avoid boring industrial streets! Back to TOGA - a delightfully modern feel to the cozy restaurant - we were greeted by friendly staff who knew their menu well, and were proud of the food they prepared. Sarah and I shared a ceviche starter, and I took the waiter’s recommendation of a special noodle dish flavoured with kim-chee - innovative and very tasty.

It's about halfway between either the Tirso de Molina and La Latina Metro stop. Surprisingly, not many reviews on yelp but well worth your time. it was our favorite restaurant during a 3+ week trip to Spain. We enjoyed it so much that we came to nights in a row ( as they are closed on Mondays). While you do not absolutely need a reservation if you show up at 8 o'clock in the evening, they are popular enough that they will only give you a one hour seating time. This is enough to have a pleasant meal but if you really want to enjoy yourself make a reservation ahead of time. What makes this place so good? Of course, the food is outstanding. The pork dish melts in your mouth and on the second night I decided to get the tuna sashimi with kimchi mayonnaise special which seems to be on the menu fairly regularly.the explosion of flavor when I took my first bite was incredible. The first night I had cerviche which was fine though I think there are better choices.  The thing that makes this a complete experiences that the staff is wonderful. They're hard-working, happy, helpful, and smile at you. This total ambience that they are both serving good food and also enjoy having you there is something that very few restaurants offer. at the end of our second meal, our favorite server even brought us each an aperitif to show complete our meal in typical Spanish fashion. Can't say enough about this place. We spent €40 the first night for two of us and 60 the second for meal that I would clearly be willing to spend $150-200 for the US.",2019-10-20,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d11955452-Reviews-or10-Toga-Madrid.html,UID_7322,0.004,0.761,0.234,0.9979,0.277452934662237,0.5236766334440754,0.2842294117647059,1622,145,0.0893958076448828,0,36,False,71,0.1097560975609756,0.1951219512195122,0.2439024390243902,0.1097560975609756,0.1951219512195122,0.024390243902439,0.0,0.024390243902439,0.0975609756097561,0.0,296,190,4.47972972972973,0,0,outstand experi visit madrid locat conveni halfway either tirso de molina la latina metro stop surprisingli mani review yelp well worth time favorit restaur week trip spain enjoy much came night row close monday absolut need reserv show clock even popular enough give one hour seat time enough pleasant meal realli want enjoy make reserv ahead time make place good cours food outstand pork dish melt mouth second night decid get tuna sashimi kimchi mayonnais special seem menu fairli regularli explos flavor took first bite incred first night cervich fine though think better choic thing make complet experi staff wonder hard work happi help smile total ambienc serv good food also enjoy someth restaur offer end second meal favorit server even brought us aperitif show complet meal typic spanish fashion say enough place spent first night two us second meal would clearli will spend us,good review,4,Spanish

The restaurant is indeed small, tucked away on a quiet side street a few blocks from the Plaza Mayor, and it's essential to make a reservation -- we saw several parties turned away (though the restaurant was accommodating in encouraging a group to return at 11 for a late dinner). We were especially glad to find that Toga was open on Sunday evening, as many other Madrid restaurants are closed at that time. The staff were very warm, friendly, and helpful in recommending wines to pair with our food. The sun-dried tomato/avocado/anchovy pintxo, the butterfish ceviche, and the croquettes were all excellent -- and the kitchen kindly prepared a tasty simple pasta for our son. The chocolate and dulche de leche alfajor was a perfect conclusion to the meal, served with a Spanish digestif and delicious cortado. The service was attentive, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming -- a modern take on traditional Spanish food, drawing a youthful, non-touristy crowd. Toga was the perfect conclusion to our stay in Madrid, and I only wish we hadn't found it on our last night -- we would definitely have returned to try many other dishes.

Our plan was to focus on dipping into the tastes of the ocean via the recommends from the warm and smiling team running the show. And what a show. The kimchi flavoured tuna noodles were a highlight, battling with the generous butterfish cerviche for top ranking. The seafood squid risotto took bronze with a magnificent performance on the tastebuds. Our encore was a ridiculously chocolatey-chocolate triumph lightly crunchy on the outside that overwhelmed the sensations when you went in deep - absolutely stunning. The whole lot came to less than 50 euros which could be considered a gift. Our mountains retreat had been a wonderful experience but Toga was kind enough to remind us that the civilisation can offer it’s own spectacular delights. Muchos Gracias.

We had, hands down, one of the best meals we’ve had while travelling through Italy and Spain. We noticed reviews referencing the ceviche and noodles so we asked for one of each to share. The butterfish ceviche was full of fresh flavours, while the noodles were just sensational. We were recommended a pineapple, mascarpone, white chocolate and lime zest dessert and it completed the perfect meal. We had the trifecta and I suspect it will be a long time before anything measures up. Well done to the chef and thank you to the lovely gentleman staff for an unforgettable lunch.

We started with a ceviche of butterfish which was amazing. The creaminess of the avocado and the zing of the red onion worked well.  Next up we tried wok fried noodles with raw tuna. This too was fresh, tasty, and the flavours of the fish certainly came out. We followed this with a fillet of Iberian pork with grilled vegetable which was lovely. We couldn’t leave without trying a dessert and so we went for pancakes with dulce de leche and banana which was amazing - very sweet, but so good! The staff were friendly and helpful and gave fantastic recommendations on the food and wine. At less than €60 with coffee and 2 glasses of wine each, this was fantastic value for the quality and creativity of the food.

Apparently, the restaurant did not get the message about an allergy that I have to a certain vegetable. It was shocking how little flexibility the chef has and how much adaptation she lacks. I was able to find most dishes that did not have the particular ingredient. However, when it came to the mushroom dish, I was served plain mushrooms!!! I mean really how difficult is it to throw some seasoning, any sauce on top to just give the mushrooms some flavor? The rest of the food was very good though with an excellent presentation. The female staff who attended to us initially was not the most welcoming. We ordered a wine bottle recommended by the sommelier only to be told bit later that they no longer have it.  Overall, this experience was disappointing especially where I was there to celebrate a special occasion. I would not come back to this restaurant or recommend it to friends or family.

Everything we ate tasted delicious and the attention to detail on the presentation of the food was just amazing. We were.given a lot of detail about everything on our plates and I just couldn't believe how tasty everything was. We thought the 70 euro price was very reasonable for the delicious food and the experience. We thoroughly enjoyed the wine served with each dish and loved hearing the background story for each of the wines we tried. However, we all felt like we were overcharged for the wine.

Walked in with no reservation at 9pm on a Saturday night and lucked into a table, it was already full of locals.  The staff were very friendly and spoke English, they also had English menus. The food was fantastic. Made some of our own pics and also went with some from the staff. TarTar was delicious as was the tuna and everything else.  We ordered everything at once, armature move, you should order one or two small plates then when you finish order the next and so on. I knew the staff was great when we were ordering and he said that is probably enough for two you can always order more after. Many places will just encourage you to order more to pad the bill, not here.  Cool clean decor, fun music, not a tourist trap, will return. Consider contacting them for a reservation.

It does say on Trip Advisor that the restaurant is open from 1:00pm-1:00am however when we arrived there at 8:00pm it was just opening. We were able to reserve a table for 8.30pm although they had to turn away a large group who were queued behind us as they were pretty much fully booked. The restaurant itself is clean and modern with only around 30 covers at max capacity, the toilets are also modern and very clean. The menu is small, consisting of 4 pinchos, mains and desserts and 10 entrees. We opted for a couple of pinchos each and a main of the Argentinian rib eye followed by a dessert each. We also had one bottle of wine and our bill came to just over €80 which we were really surprised by as the standard of the food being served was fantastic. The waiting staff are all very polite and sociable and know each dish on the menu inside out and were happy to give recommendations or advise on combinations. We got talking to the couple on the table next to us and instead of opting for a main they ordered three different entrees to share, which were all brought out to them separately, were of a good portion size for sharing and the presentation of each dish was perfect.

We were happy to see that the restaurant was only 2 blocks away from where we are staying and decided to give it a try while in Madrid.  The experience was wonderful. The owners greeted us (They speak English!) and explained the menu very descriptively. They were also able to give us recommendations from their menu which is not always easy to obtain in Madrid. We ordered their pasta special with raw tuna, the scallop with buckwheat pearls and beets, the butterfish, and the Argentinian steak. The dishes were amazing. The pasta was made with rice noodles. We can only describe it as a super ramped up Pad Thai. The creamy sauce was flavored with cilantro and lime. We were advised to mix the tuna into the mixture, and the pasta became pure heaven! The scallop dish was so aesthetically pleasing, it looked like a plate from a Michelin star restaurant and tasted just as wonderful. The Butter Fish, which was raw, was also amazing. It was flavored with some citrus and also an acid finish, almost like a Japanese Ponzu sauce.  The dessert was worth saving room for as well. I would full-heartedly recommend Toga.
